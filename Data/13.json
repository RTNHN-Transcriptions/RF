We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hello and welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. I'm Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. How are you doing guys? Great. Good. Merry Christmas. Yeah, Merry Christmas. It's Christmas time around here. Around here? I don't know why I said that. I think it's Christmas time most everywhere. I think you're probably right. Unless you're listening to this at a different time in which it might not be Christmas. That's an excellent point. Okay, that's an excellent point. Guys, I wanted to bring something up as we get our conversation started. Just hanging out on social media the other day and I saw somebody comment on, they were commenting on some comments that Matt Chandler made back in August about deconstructing faith. Let me just read a little tweet that this person said. Basically it says, the reductive language here. Again, we're not really going to unpack any of what Matt Chandler said other than the fact that this says, if you quote, if you really experienced Jesus, you wouldn't deconstruct speaks volumes. Also Chandler calling deconstruction a sexy fad as if we all weren't Neo Calvinist Theo Bros in 2011. Pot and kettle, Matt. Essentially, I don't know if you'd call it reductive language or whatever, but maybe that's not even the right word, but reducing what people actually, their experiences or whatever. Dismissive. Dismissive, exactly. Oversimplifying. Right. That was like, okay, I know that we are not, that's not what we're saying on our podcast. I think it would be valuable because this is a conversation that people are having. I saw this posted because somebody who I know who deconstructed their faith commented on that. And so it's like, okay, how are you, as we're having these conversations specifically about this, how would you address that? Well, I think our initial response was it, for some people it is the sexy thing to do right now. Yeah. So you got to be honest with that and just say, are you actually doing this or is it you really have had all these questions and now you feel safe? Right. To bring them up because before you felt like it's almost like your community capital. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. The social capital. That before I knew too many people or I was still involved in too much of a ministry or that bubble, right? That it would have been too scandalous then, but now I'm removed from that or I'm older. And so now I feel safer to do that. But hopefully we're not given the impression here. Right. That we're flipping about it. Yeah. There are people that have pretty bad reasons or haven't thought through their reasons very well. Right. And I don't know, we were looking at the Babylon bees thing on, you know, someone who deconstruct uniquely, uniquely just like everyone else. If you haven't seen that, we'll probably link that in the show notes. But what were you going to say specifically about that? So even, even though, I mean, that's, you know, stereotypes like that are funny and there's obviously plenty of me, Babylon has spent a long time mocking Christian Christians and Christianity from within appropriately. So, but I think, you know, we don't ever want to like, like I said, we don't treat it flippantly. Yeah. There are funny stereotypes in almost every situation. And, and some of those are pretty darn funny. Right. I think for some people it is, like you said, a sexy fad or like, which, who, which pastor was it who allegedly said it, who was being signed? Sorry, Matt Chandler. Matt Chandler. And so I've not heard, you know, we've not heard the whole sermon and we've never had the context and all of that, but there are certainly sometimes there are people who get caught up in a fad like this. And then you, and it's, that's, that, that can be true. That also does not discount what they're saying or what they're experiencing. Like those are Christianity, people can get in and become Christians because they're caught up in a fad as well. And so that's just human nature. Sometimes it's to follow the crowd one direction or another. And that's actually, gosh, I'm thinking about what is it? Is it, is it Ephesians four that talks about not being swept back and forth. And that just suddenly struck me is that, is that that is a, yeah, that is an important concept in, in scripture is that the apostle Paul knows perfectly well, we can get caught up in that kind of stuff easily. There it is. So, um, uh, yeah, he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds teachers to equip the saints for the ministry, the, for the work of the ministry for building up the body of Christ until we all attain to the measure to the unity of the faith. I'm struggling here. And of the knowledge of the son of God to mature adulthood to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. So we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried by every wind of doctrine, human cunning, craftiness in deceitful schemes and consider that so much of what Paul was correcting was not, uh, from without it was from within. And so Christians and anybody humans, we are kind of pack animals and we love to get caught up in where the we're following along with where we're going. And so I, you know, yes, that may be the reason for some, but I feel like that would come dangerously close to like, um, uh, attacking the person rather than attacking the person's arguments and attacking their motives like, Oh, you're just saying this because it's a fad. I think you need to be careful that you don't join into this because it's a fad. And yet that doesn't mean there's not plenty to talk about. And as we've said, there's healthy versions of deconstruction. Right. And in fact, on that note, we thought we'd have a little fun given that it's Christmas time. You don't have a Christmas button somewhere, do you? Let's see. Let's see. I think the pink one was fairy tale. Yay. Christmas. The yellow button. The yellow button was that. So we, um, in one of our other podcasts, we run into the button crisis on a regular basis. I do a bad job of memorizing the button. So it's just become a joke that Colson doesn't know the button. So he just pushes one. I didn't even know that we had buttons. Yeah, I'm sure we'll learn them sometime. I think it's funnier when we don't, but as long as there's a buzz one for when I say balance, Chris needs to have that one though. So all of buzz me, we just need a huge buzzer. Um, Christmas conversation is exactly right. That's where we want to go is, um, since it's Christmas, we thought we would do a little Christmas deconstruction today on the podcast. And, uh, a lot of the things we were raised with preconceptions, the things that are nativity scenes have, et cetera. Um, man, I think, I think those can be, those are the kinds of things that can be really painful for us. And if we're not careful, when we learn to deconstruct something that needs to be deconstructed, we end up tossing out too much. And, uh, and so we're in our Christmas conversation, just defining Christmas in the biblical sense, right? We're not going to be talking about Santa Claus or anything. Right. And then we could mention St. Nicholas, but, but all that to say is like, you know, just to just so people are listening, like we're talking probably mainly in the biblical context. Exactly. That's our focus. Okay. Great. Yeah. We could get really carried away with it. But what I think happens, cause I know we're going to give a lot of examples of this is when you take something from someone that they have built either in their mind or a picture or everything they've ever seen about something, there's two things that I think of. One is if it's, if it wasn't true, then you never really had it in the first place. Like it just wasn't true. Right. If you had that idea. So let me, can I just throw out one example? Go for it. A wooden manger. So most mangers, if you go over to Israel and I think just going to Israel helps with so many stereotypes. Right. The ones that I saw over there, the ones you see a lot of them are just carved out of stone. I've ever, every one, every first century manger I've been shown. Right. And so, but the second thing that means is understanding that has nothing to do with your faith. Right. Exactly. Nothing has been lost. Jesus is still king of the universe. Right. But it is still, you have to mourn a little bit and just kind of go, Oh, yes. I just, I guess I was wrong there, but it's okay. Like don't then think therefore all of this thing is a fraud, you know, like don't panic. There's literally the example that I use when I'm teaching people on cognitive dissonance, how the emotion that we have to finding out we've always been wrong about. Yeah. And, and it's so shocking and painful for us as humans to do that, that, but while we'll put it up on the screen, cause I had to deal with it. So it's a little bit of hazing, to be honest. Yeah. Standing in Israel and having a guide saying, anybody know what this is? Right. And it's going like trip. I was on in a way. Yeah. At Megiddo when the guy's standing there and he points and now have you been back? Cause now they've had the animal cutouts, which is just ruins the song. Funny. But you might know what this is. And people are like, I got nothing. I mean, it just looks and he goes, this is a manger. And in particular, it's a first century manger. When Jesus was laid in a manger, when babies laid in manger, it wasn't probably it. We can't know for sure. There are no wooden manger, but we lost all photos of the, exactly. And, uh, but probably it was made out of stone. And like you said, theologically, what does that mean? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And yet it was disturbing. I mean, I had to actually kind of like shake that off. I was like, Nope, no, no, no, no. I mean, exactly. From what you were saying, like there's a, you said you have a whole list. So there's a, there are a lot of things that can just be misconceptions. Things we've believed incorrectly about something like Christmas. I have one up in my house right now. Oh, a bunch probably, but yeah, it's just our nativity scene. Yeah. It's just the wise men come with the, they come with the set. And so it would be imbalanced like the way it's set up. Yeah, exactly. I put it up there, but I should probably tell my children. So two years from now, two years from now, we'll bring in the wise men. Right. Let's, okay. Let's pick on the wise men for a second, because that's a, that's a fun one. Pretty much everything we say about the wise men is wrong. And it's because it comes from the song. We three Kings of Orient are, and everything about that three, we have no idea how many wise men there were. We just know there are three gifts, correct? There are three gifts. Okay. And so does that mean three by no means does that mean three wise men? In fact, the three gifts, which the rest of the song, by the way, unpacks, and most people don't know that are very prophetically profound. Yeah. Gold for a King, frankincense for a priest, myrrh for a dead male. Yeah. And so they, they had done the work to figure out who, who they were coming to see. They knew the scriptures and they came and brought the correct gifts for a King, a priest and a dead man. And, and they knew that. And it's very telling and powerful. So again, when you deconstruct the great value in reconstruction is so cool that you got what I've had taken from me, they weren't Kings. There's nothing about the past is that implies royalty. They were scholars probably, and they weren't from the Orient. They were from Persia almost certainly that we can't know that for sure, but from the east of Israel from the east. And so the idea that they came from, I don't know, Mongolia or China or Japan is not really reasonable, especially when you have, you know, somewhere between 200 and 600 years before Hebrew scriptures and Hebrew rabbis and teachers in Persia, Daniel, it makes much more sense that that's who would have had access to it. Who would have anyway, but the idea there being three. And I mean, tradition. Now we have them named. None of this is in the Bible. What we have are that the scholars from the east came and brought three gifts. Yes. Everything else is invented. And it wasn't all on the same night as the shepherd's coming. See, I love, have you seen the movie, the Nativity? Yeah. I love the way they, they did so much with details and stuff. And yet the same thing at the end of the movie, they're all there. Mary holding newborn Jesus, and there's the wise man. And it's like, did you read that? Just for the sake of time, we didn't do this. Exactly. Matthew two, it actually says at the house, they came to the house where Mary was, not in the... It's not wherever. Yeah. And now they are still in Bethlehem, which is intriguing. And then with the reason we guess at two years is because when Herod asks them, he wants to kill all the children who might include baby Jesus. And he asks them how long it had been. And whatever answer they give him, which it doesn't say caused him to kill all the children two years and under, all the boys two years and under. Surprisingly, in the two year range, the Jesus story of the Bible that my kids grew up with actually has it correct. Yep. They show Jesus is more like a toddler with the ones that come into the house. So I was like, okay, good job. Yep. Well done. You read your Bible as you created the Jesus story of the Bible. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. The wise men, that's a good thing to deconstruct. How about Jesus being born on December 25th? There you go. Isn't that... Right. You think it's shocking to people to discover that of all possible dates, this is among the least likely? I think, especially, I mean, as a kid, probably late elementary school hearing that like, wait, what? Yeah. I had no idea. So can we unpack that a little bit? Absolutely. We don't know what day of the year Jesus was born on. Again, it's not particularly significant. It probably would have been fall or spring. In fact, some people have tried to narrow down when Simeon would have been in the temple, when his group would have been in the temple and they say fall. And then spring is for those who, you know, all the animals are outdoors and that kind of stuff. And that's interesting. So it's hard to... It's really hard to know for sure. We don't know for sure. But the dead of December in Israel is just not a super likely time for this to have all played out. Like to do a census and do all this stuff. Do all the stuff that allegedly happened. So the common idea though is that the Christians said, we're going to go ahead and take this pagan holiday. And we're going to make it into one where we celebrate Jesus. Yep. And so that's why it's on December 25th. Yes. Is that the early church, the Orthodox church early on intentionally put Christian holidays on top of pagan holidays. And I have actually an extensive article on my website about some of that. So we might send people to that. When a minute ago, when you said that I have something up in my house that isn't biblical, I thought you were going to say a tree, a Christmas tree, because that's so many of the things that we use to celebrate Christmas actually have pagan roots. Now, as I like to point out, there's no such thing as pagan roots. The pagans didn't invent trees. Druids didn't invent evergreens. God did all that. He gets to maintain ownership. Of course, they've been abused by people since then, but that's why I'm fine putting up a Christmas tree in my house and having even a yule log or mistletoe, all kinds of things that might have pagan history or whatever. But that's a, now part of that is interesting even to know that Christmas was not a big celebration in the early church, which is part of why we don't know. We don't know when he was born because it was several hundred years before the church decided to even mess with that. And I think at first there was a lot of resistance. There was. Don't celebrate that or that's wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Whether it's, I guess it's in Ecclesiastes, it talks about not celebrating the day of a man's birth or whatever, but I think there's nothing wrong with celebrating the birth of Jesus. I enjoy it. I think it's great. We are celebrating an event, though not the date. No, Easter was the only one that, I mean, Easter is the one that matters for Christianity. That's the one that, I mean, a baby being born is cool only if Easter happened. And so that's, and we do know when that one happened because it's connected to Passover and all that kind of stuff. So it's, anyway, that's a different issue. What do you think about the idea that the, since they were so close to Jerusalem, shepherds and their sheep could have been part of those that are, were used for the daily sacrifices? Absolutely. I think that's 100% true. When we, this last time that I went to Israel, we got to go to a place we've never gone, which is in, they have found what they think is a shepherd's cave and in Bethlehem, and some argue that this may have actually been where Jesus was given or where Mary gave birth to Jesus would have been in a cave like this. And we don't, and by the way, from the language, that's another one of those. There was no N. N is almost certainly a mistranslation. It could be home. It could be stable. It could be cave. It could be any number of things. Yes. I like what you said yesterday about, the family wouldn't let them, because of the stigma of Mary. So I've read this a couple of times. Israel was an honor shame culture, still is to some degree, which means everything comes down to, does your life bring honor to your family or does your life bring shame to your family and Mary getting pregnant before being married would have been a great shame probably. And some people think combination of they weren't wealthy. They were very poor. And if there's competition to get a space on the floor in someone's house, even if it's a family member, if you, if you haven't seen it, they do a pretty good job with this, although they have a wooden manger in the chosen's Christmas special. I got to watch it finally. I didn't watch it yet. I didn't know that it's about 60% music video, which is fun. And there's great songs and all that kind of stuff. But the, about 40%, that's a narrative story is very well done. But they show this correctly. Like Joseph, of course, it's not like he could call ahead and check, right? Like there's no way they show that very well. In fact, throughout the whole episode, the difficulty of communication in the first century. And so as they're trying to communicate things back and forth, they can't even just send it in. It's not like there's a, you can't send it in a letter. Right. Even that when people go, why don't they just put it in a letter? Like, well, because there's no such thing as a post office. I mean, there's homing pigeon. All the only thing you can do is hand it to someone and hope that someday they get to where that letter is supposed to go. But I think so that Joseph is coming into town. He's like, I think this is where my nephew or uncle live, but they could have moved anytime in the years since I've been here. And they may not let us in. And he goes and says something. And then comes back to Mary and says, they're, they're saying there's no room. And he kind of unpacks like, I don't know how much of that is, we don't have the money. How much of that is they're not really happy with your condition. How much of that is they really just don't have any room. And so they've offered us a place with the animals and they do a good job of me and it could be any of those. But the idea that the just the, the N was booked up is totally a Western medieval concept. There were probably no such thing as an N in Bethlehem. I mean, maybe, but that's another one of those tough ones that when we read it, so again, a better picture when you suddenly you have them, maybe for example, in a shepherd's cave, which would have been kept immaculately clean because of the point you were making the first born male lamb was the first born male lamb was immediately checked for any blemish. And if it had no blemish, it was suddenly worth a small fortune. Yeah. Wow. Because that's all you could, that's the only thing you could do or many of the sacrifices. And so the shepherds, even though they weren't high on the organizational chart in society, they, they were considered vitally important at this juncture. They're the first ones to get to these lambs. And so they had special sacred cloth given to them from the temple that was blessed to wrap first born lambs in while they were being evaluated for what they were. And the idea that those were, those cloths would have been laying around in a shepherd's cave. Yeah, that's true. And that that would be all I mean, I actually was convinced years ago that the word swaddling close there doesn't mean he'll have cloth wrapped around him. That would not distinguish a baby. Right. It would be that that cloth, it is, it is the swaddling clothes, you will find a human baby wrapped in sheep swaddling cloth, which came from the temple. And I was, I was convinced by that years ago that that was right. And they portray that very well in the chosen thing as well. So related to that too, you mentioned the idea that it's like a stable, like a, he's born in a barn, because again, so many nativity scenes, it's literally like a little barn with the roof. And so the idea more, and again, I think, I think it was my trip to Israel. Yeah. Even the church in the nativity, you go down there and they're like this little cave and they admit that it could be a cave. Yes. But that idea that that is more likely where the animals could have been kept. Again, you've got all these, you know, ideas in your brain that it was a structure. Right. Again, it could have been, but it's also more likely that it was. Yeah. A cave or a lean to, or, or just something carved in the ground. Yeah. So yeah, those are, those are examples of like deconstructing something. But here's what, what I've learned over the years is when you deconstruct something and instead dig up what's really there, it's so much better. Right. So much better. And so when I deconstruct this little stable, it looks like a middle Eastern, I mean a middle European stable built in the 1500s with a bunch of, by the way, a bunch of middle European people sitting around. Right. Not middle Easterners. Right. That's another thing that needs to be deconstructed is Mary in almost all these paintings, Mary and Joseph dressed like people born in the 14th century or 15th century looking European. They're as European as they can possibly be. Right. You mentioned the cave of the nativity, the church in the nativity. I've re every time I go, I don't go down in the cave anymore because I don't find it very valuable. I don't even hardly go in the church anymore because I don't find it all that valuable, even though it's ancient. But down in the cave, there are paintings, medieval paintings lining the walls down in the cave. And in all of them, baby Jesus is a redheaded. He looks Irish and I always crow because I'm a redhead. And so I always am like, see, we all knew he was born perfect. But the idea of Jesus being born as a stark white redhead is just absurd. Right. It needs to be deconstructed. He needs to look like, I don't know, a Jew, a middle Eastern, first century Jew, whatever that looked like. And there's great now, great art done to show some of that stuff. Well, with so many Jesus paintings, he's got blue eyes. Yeah. Right. Even the one in the seventies, Jesus of Nazareth, that British actor, blue eyes, like really bright blue eyes. And I don't. And even paintings with Adam and Eve looking like white. Yes. You know, how silly. It's interesting. Yeah. Well, there's another, think about, gosh, we could, we could do a whole thing on Christmas songs. Yeah. I was just thinking about the silent night, holy night. Like what would have been silent about the birth of a baby? Right. Barry probably was not silent. Was not silent. And babies are typically not silent once they're born. And so, and I think it's so wild that in that song, it's like we're supposed to honor the fact that Jesus was such a good little baby, no crying he made like, right. So his Apgar score was not great. I guess like he, I mean, it's a, that's just such, such a silliness that when we apply that and that kind of stuff, isn't there a new song that came out that not that long ago that starts with like, it was not a silent night. There was blood upon the floor. There's a song that goes like that Christmas song. Yeah. Anyway. But, and again, I think going to Israel makes you feel more real. Like this, this really happened. Like real events. Like this is actually the, because it's no longer just pictures or paintings or movies. That would be interesting. So someone, someone out there who is wrestling with it being in the midst of deconstruction, if Israel ever opens its borders again, it'd be good to, it'd be an interesting experience to take someone in the midst of deconstruction to Israel and see if that impacts the gritty, dirty reality of it that helps. And I love that what you were saying is like, as you deconstruct and really find, you know, deconstruct, reconstruct, finding the real beauty of the truth. I mean, to me, I haven't been to Israel yet, but I can imagine it's like, God, you didn't come to a clean stable. Right. You, you came to this. They didn't even come to a clean era. Exactly. And so it's like, that's amazing. You know, it's like, you could have come now when there's medical, you know, technology, but you didn't. And I don't know, there, there's so much incredible beauty and humility in that. And so that that's really cool. Are there any other things you want to deconstruct you think would be beneficial? I've seen this, this war on Christmas idea. Okay. And, and I guess that would be more of a political deconstruction that I don't, I don't understand the fear somehow. I mean, even when I was a kid, I remember people getting mad about Xmas. Yeah. There's the symbol for X instead of it and not knowing that that's just the Latin abbreviation for Christ. And so people would freak out like, Oh, they're pulling it out. So yeah, crossing, like railroad crossing. So you've got to have a symbol for anything is about Jesus Christ cross. You have to have a symbol like, I mean, but that is the, that's the, what the Chi, whatever this may be wrong on that, but the symbol, the X symbol, that is the symbol that's used as the abbreviation for cross or Christ. So that that's not, it literally is just save space. It's not intended. Well, at the root, it's not intended to be offensive. I don't know each person's heart, but I, you hear, you know, nowadays it does seem silly that we're so, I mean, there was just news this week about, I think in the EU, them putting out something about not, you know, not everyone is Christian. So don't use Christmas names and new words. And when you're telling a story from Christmas, don't use the word Maria use some other name or whatever, which this did, that did not go over well. Yeah. Italy was less than pleased at the thought of we're not supposed to use the name Maria. And so, um, it got blasted and torn to pieces, even among like in the French government, which is very secular. They blew it apart. Like this is just silliness, but I don't know. I don't, I don't, I'm not afraid of some war on Christmas and I've not, I've never been, that's never overly concerned me. I'm much, much more concerned. In my mind, the war on Christmas is, is Christian celebrating Christmas and not celebrating Christ in the midst of him or much less the rest of the year. So that to me seems much more dangerous. Um, there's a few other little ones like, uh, people think that Christmas there's much more depression and suicide around Christmas. And that's not necessarily the case. There's the special kind of grieving of the loss of family around holidays, but, um, suicide numbers don't, don't really spike during that time. But I don't know that those are really biblical. Yeah. But interesting around that. That's, that's a lot of the ones I've got. Do you have any other? No, I did want to, you mentioned Saint Nicholas. I think it is fascinating that he, the actual Saint Nicholas, uh, was at the council of Nicaea because he loved Jesus so much. And he was really distraught by Arius and his wrong views of Jesus. Arius thought basically that same as Jehovah's Witness today, that he was a created being. A created being, right. And, uh, depending on which, uh, account you read, he either walked over and slapped or punched Arius during the council. Like he was so fed up with this heresy of this guy. So I like rooming on my kids. The real Saint Nicholas loves Jesus. And it's, he knows that it's not about him. Man, hardcore Santa. Yeah. That's the, uh, you see those shirts I'm saying Nicholas is here to hand out gifts and punch heretics. But actually, so if you read, apparently reading through that, it isn't what it is. It wasn't that he was a hot tempered guy. It's that Arius had a spare, a him he had written and it was, he and his student were there. They had a him he had written that portrayed Jesus as a created being. And Arius kept singing the hymn over other people trying to defend the more traditional view of Jesus as God. And apparently Arius was just making a real jerk of himself in the midst of this. And that's why that is apparently what motivated Nicholas to walk up and he wouldn't be silenced. So Nicholas apparently silenced him. And I think he got in trouble. Like he did dismiss, but then he got brought back. Yeah, exactly. But again, and these are guys, again, the council of Nicaea is right after persecution actually ends. Yeah. And so you've get, you've got people showing up, bishops and stuff who have been tortured. I mean, for, yeah, like they've been, they've gone through so much stuff, but as soon as it's, they're willing to show up and, and again, take a stand for what they'd been taking a stand for. But again, I just love the reminder that St. Nicholas really was, was great. Yeah. And apparently, and was known for being extremely generous, very gentle and kind and general when he wasn't punching heretics and loving Jesus. That's right. Maybe, maybe under reindeer. We don't know. That's a mixture. The modern day, Santa Claus is a mixture of a kind of a father Christmas father winter character and St. Nicholas. And they're all mixed together. And anyway, okay. Spoiler alert. That's great. Sorry. Well, hey, but this is great. Deconstructing Christmas. Yeah. And, and instead reconstructing what really was there and learning it's, it's better. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I, yeah, I love it. And learning these stories make a lot of sense to me and they help me. So that's a good example. Yeah. What did you do? This is related, but also still a side note, but this might help. Did you do this Santa Claus thing with your kids? Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay. I actually have an article. So again, if there are young ears listening, really young ears listening now might be a time to, to take a break, take the air pods. Exactly. Take the air. Let the, let the, let the little ones just go dismiss them for a moment. So I'll give you a few seconds to, to remove young ears that don't want to hear about how we handled old St. Nicholas at our house. Okay. So that's enough time now. You could have pressed pause. Exactly. So I actually do have an article written about this. We do, we do the whole Santa Claus deal and we get gifts from Santa Claus and all the way up. The children do. We never do the naughty list, nice list. You stay away from that. Okay. Because I think that communicates a totally different message that we don't believe in. The way we unpack that in proper time is we talk about the idea of giving gifts in somebody else's name. And so what we do is we talk about how we've been inspired and how our culture is inspired by the generosity of St. Nicholas. And we teach who he was. And then we say we've been inspired by that. So in honor of the type of person he was, we now give gifts to each other as if they're from St. Nicholas. And because of his, the type of man he was and the honor he deserves with that. And that just, he just became linked to this. And it's kind of like, that's also when we break to them that their grandparents probably haven't bought them a gift in a while. Grandparents send us money and we buy them a gift. And so sometimes that's the case. Now that depends on year to year, some years grandparents do it, but it's the same thing. How did your kids react? They all thought it was hilarious. They all loved it. So far, every one of them has loved it. And it's been kind of funny. It's a little sophisticated when we talk about it. And so I don't remember who it was. Ginger would know if she was here, but at least one of them, we told them the whole thing and they're like, Oh, okay. Got it. Yes. And the next year they clearly had not got it. They were like, still, still like, no, I believe type of... So now you wait till they're 15. Exactly. Mark still doesn't know. Exactly. Don't tell Mark about this. But it has been great. And we talk about the difference between the reality of who St. Nicholas was and the fact that we honor him by giving gifts and his name. And we have fun with it. And the reality of there really was a guy and how that's different from what we teach about Jesus and that kind of stuff. And the reason I ask... So we actually, our family didn't with my kids. We still obviously did gifts or whatever, but part of it was, I think a reaction to right after we'd gotten married, Katie, that last year before we got married was a school teacher, she got in trouble at her school for talking about Jesus at Christmas public school. But she would ask the kids, all right, who knows what Christmas is about with the intent of how many... So they share, then I get to share. But so many of them were all about Santa Claus and gifts and stuff. And then of course, one little kid would be like, the birth of our Lord and Savior. She's like, you're right. Like she would make it a big deal, but she got in trouble for it. So we decided we weren't going to do that. We were going to talk about the real St. Nicholas. But we told our kids, but don't ruin this for anybody else. But the thing that convinced me actually, and this is almost related to this. I don't know if it's related to deconstruction, but one guy, I remember him telling me the story where when his kid said, is Santa for real? Yeah. His first response was, he wasn't ready for it. And so he kind of was like a political answer. Like, what do you mean by that? Like, how would you define... Like he didn't want to... Because I remember... Yeah. When I asked my mom, I remember where I was when she, when I asked her that question. It's a funny story too. I saw two different Santa Clauses in the mall and I was like, what? And then the one whose lap I did sit on, his beard, apparently as much as coming off a little bit. And it was almost like elf, where I was like, he's a phony. He's sitting on the throne of lies. But this dad said, he said his son down, or son asked him that. And he finally said, no, Santa's not for real. And a little bit later, his son came back and said, dad, are we one day going to have this same talk about Jesus? Exactly. And that's where the dad was like, oh my goodness. Because now he felt like it's a matter of credibility. Right. Like, are my kids going to believe this thing? Because I've been talking, you know, Santa can do all these amazing things. Right. And God can do all these amazing things, but is it just... Right. So anyways, we ended up not, but... Yep. And it's, I don't know that there's a, I think it all comes down to as it so often does how you handle it. Right. How families how are you communicating it to? Yeah. Yeah. And that's a, if it is a, if it comes across as like, I've been lied to, versus let me explain what's been going on. Right. And it's more like a surprise party. I mean, yes, we did not tell you the whole truth, but it was for your benefit. And there is a truth behind this that we want to unpack with you. Right. They seem a lot, the feedback I get is good. It's when it is, it's when it, and I have actually had clients who as a therapist who really struggled with my parents lied to me. And, but then you discover, I mean, her parents were liars. I mean, their parents were his, were, were, this was a repetitive issue. Yeah. And they didn't ever teach it. It was just like, no kid deal with it, you know, and bring me my cigarettes type of like, it's a, it was a not a not issue, not well handled. Yeah. So yeah, it's a, it is important. And one of our, by the way, one of our little, little rules is, is that we, we don't directly answer when they ask. They were like, well, you know, what do you think? And let's talk about it. And so that, that, that later on, there's not this, I remember when you said, I asked you point blank. And, and so we just have, we have fun with it. And then by the way, we, we wrangle the older kids in, when you wrangle them in with the younger kids and say, now you get to be a part of having fun with this. Anyway, I, it is, I think it is a risk and we actually, those of you who aren't obviously around it, we actually have inflatable Santas and reindeer and snowmen and, and nativity scene around our children's building. And one of the things we wrestled with was, okay, we're going to be watching for, is there a risk of, people come to church and experience something not credible, not reliable. And so we've kind of wrestled with it, but as always, it seems like it's the adults who are wrestling with it, not the children at this stage. Maybe they will, but, but it's, it's has the same feel of, I mean, the nativity scene I grew up with was a lie as we just talked about. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. How do you help? How do you help your children deconstruct Santa? Is that probably a very healthy conversation? How do you do it well? And then I'm actually kind of liking this theme that when, when something gets taken away from you, what, what gets added? Yeah. And maybe that's part of why for us, it wasn't a big deal because Santa Claus got taken from me, but Saint Nicholas and generosity was given in its place. Right. So maybe that's part of the confusion for people. Yeah. And I think related to that, that's a really good point. I mean, I think we've been saying this, maybe not as clearly is that right there that a lot of people, it is trendy or sexy or whatever to deconstruct. And it's always kind of, even in a probably prideful way to be always the philosopher, always the skeptic, always the never land the plane, because then you, then you sound like you arrived or it's your normal, you understand. Right. Right. Right. But that's actually, it's okay to do that. If the, if the truth is pointing in that direction, you can land the plane there. Right. And I think that's the challenge that why we are even calling this reconstructed faith is that we're assuming you're wanting to come up with something that is worth believing in. Right. And we're offering that to you or that's what we're going to be doing. Not just saying stop deconstructing, but just to remind people that anyone can be skeptical and ask really, really tough questions, but are you willing to think and are you willing to think hard? And keep digging and build. And keep digging. Yeah. That's not as easy. Rebuild from what you took down. And I do think this was a, that was such a big deal for me was when I realized straight from scripture, I think my dad helped with this, but most people around me didn't straight from scripture realizing this is a God who's not afraid of me deconstructing because he has something better. And we didn't use the word deconstruction when I was doing it. We just called it doubting or questioning or whatever. And once I realized that through the teachings of scripture, through the teachings of Jesus himself, much less a couple of times when apostle Paul says like test it all. Yeah, go for it. Check it out. And when I realized this is a God of truth and therefore if he is a God of truth, he would want me to believe the truth and therefore will be a claim to have the truth. I think that's a, that set me very much so free. And when I start, you've heard me, you guys have probably heard me say like I'll come when I'm teaching or something, I'll come across a passage and I'll be thinking, what, what is this? And this makes no sense to me. I've been amazed over the years how often those become my favorites. Yeah. Because if you're willing to build with that stuff, there's some amazing stuff there. So anyway, that's probably good. Merry Christmas, man. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.
