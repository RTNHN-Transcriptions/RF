We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined as always by my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg. And we have Mark Legge again here for this episode to continue kind of this conversation about kind of personal stories of walking through life, interacting with difficult situations or difficult questions and still being anchored to faith in Jesus. And so Mark, thanks for being on. I really appreciate it. Chris, can I throw it over to you? Yeah. Because you had a thought for this portion of our discussion with Mark talking about kind of anchoring. Well, so here's a, I think for many of us, when we face challenges to our beliefs or we face some new idea, one of the things we forget is that every viewpoint has difficult things that has to answer. And so when you go, okay, this is challenging my faith as it is, but if I took the other stance, I would then have to come up with an answer still for several problems. I mean, the other viewpoint has its issues as well. And as we talked about in the last episode with Mark, every human is going to be wrong at times. That's a given, right? All humans. At least at the just base level, no one makes a 100 on every math paper they ever turn. That's just not human. Humans don't do that. In fact, we've talked about before that I think Jesus' experience on earth was that he was sinless but not flawless. I think he probably missed questions on his math tests and even on his Hebrew tests. And that may panic some people, but I don't think it should. I think he took sometimes more than one hit of the hammer for him to put a nail in a board. He wasn't flawless. He was sinless. Or tripped and fell. Or tripped and fell, exactly. Or got something on his face and didn't know it. I feel like all the things we face as humans, right? So anyway, I think that's an interesting conversation as we're having. But I think for us, there's a couple for me that I fall back on. What happened with the disciples then? If Jesus was not born, lived, died, and was raised from the grave, I'm going to have to come up with an alternative theory for what happened to a bunch of Hebrew men and women 2,000 years ago that is historically accepted. I mean, there are fringe people who don't accept it, but historically you're stuck with the fact that Christianity came from something. And that this is the probably... Well, I'm going to have to come up with an alternative answer for that. And I can't... So far, I've never come up with one. So that's something I fall back on when I go, oh, but what about the problem of suffering? What do I do with that? Because I think that's one of the tough... Often a tough question. I go, okay, but if I switch some views on this, I'm going to need to come up with a solution for this problem. Or for me, the teleological argument, which we've talked about, is the most potent. The idea that there's such an obvious cause and effect relationship between, especially with designed things that I feel like I would be having to have a psychotic break to pretend like, no, no, just random chance led to random chance processes. Very complex random chance processes led to this. And I just don't know that I could make my brain go there. I don't know that I have to quote faith to do that. And so anyway, those are a couple of examples for me. And I think most of us have some of those, whether it's personal relationships or experiences or, or anyway, so I'm curious to hear, I'd love to hear what some of the marks are. I mean, it'd be good for all of us to kind of talk a little bit through that, but I'd love to hear some marks because I know that's what he's working on big time. So. Yeah, that's good. I mean, yeah, I do think everyone has those. For a lot of people, it's the testimony of God in their lives. It's some kind of event that took place where they, have this, I'm good. So maybe just for the sake of ease, I'm going to use feel. And when I say feel, I don't mean like the emotional up and down kind of, but just like they know that it is real, that they feel that it exists. They feel that God has brought them through a really hard time. And I think there's scriptural reason to put faith in that to put your trust in God because of the testimony of how he's worked through your family, of how he's worked through history of how he's led the, you know, for the Israelites out of Egypt, things like that nature. And I think for, for me, it's the holistic picture of the world that my faith offers. I've settled on that as the thing that I fall back on. And I think that kind of dodged the question a little bit, because it's kind of, well, what specific parts of that are the most integral? And I could answer that. But I think for me, remembering, as what you said, the historical evidence that Jesus walked around on the earth, and died and came back to life. And Paul even stakes Christianity on that if Jesus isn't risen, then all this is pointless, right? To paraphrase. And so that's one thing to hit, to hang your hat on. Another is the alternatives, not being very satisfactory. I think where I would land is, there's not a lot of kind of oomph to other spiritual beliefs, to other, let's say we could pick new age ideals. Let's say a kind of utopian vision for humanity that, like, I don't have enough faith in any of those visions for humanity to pick those as my set of assumptions I live my life by, to pick those as what I believe is true. And that comes back to the truth, the true ideas winning, not just in like, Oh, they make more money, or something, right? That's not what I'm talking about at all. Talking about, like ideas that actually work, that work. And when I say work, yeah, I'm not, but what I'm trying to communicate is not just in a pragmatic sense, not just in a utilitarian, like, I make more money because of my ideas. Yeah, but in a, my life is well lived because of these ideas. Yeah. And so I think one is a historical one is the other options don't really hold up. Another is, I think this what I realized is the strongest one from me personally, amid all the technical questions, because I have a very real understanding of how far a field the technical questions can take you. Like, there's a whole branch of philosophy called metaphysics, which is about what it is to be what it is to exist. And so let you know, and then there's sub disciplines of metaphysics. So you just get into the weed about what is what does even mean to be real. And you're kind of like, you know, your mind explodes, and you get into the weeds, and you realize, I don't even know what it means to exist. And so basically, what I'm trying to say is the technical questions are interesting and important. But as I said, the last episode, I think my on, how would I say this, something that you can't really argue against is the experience I've had with Jesus as a friend, as a Savior, as someone that I talked to, as someone who I've experienced his presence, as someone I find in Scripture, I think as someone who has evidence that I'm in dwelt with him. And I think some people experience a kind of general spiritual transcendent feeling in some way or another. But for me, it's very specifically in Christ. And it's not just a vibe. Yeah, it's like a specific, like personal, it's as though I'm as as though like, I'm as as I talked about in the last episode, just like I can't know for sure. If you guys have minds, ideas and feelings, I can't be sure that Jesus exists. But I'm just about as sure as other people's minds existing. And that could act as a segue because there is actually haven't read this book. But there's a book by Alvin planning, who's a Christian philosopher called God and Other Minds. And he has a bunch of arguments basically saying that a belief in God is just as justified in a belief in other people's minds. That's intriguing. Yeah. So basically, he's not saying you can prove it. But he's saying that, as justified as you are in believing in other people's, you know, personalities, experience, thoughts, feelings, you can also be just as certain that God exists. And I think that's appealing. So all to be said, that's a very simple case. It's a great case. And I think there's like a so I should say philosophical argument is one. But honestly, it's one of the maybe weaker pillars, because I recognize how technical into philosophy you can get. Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. It really does. Yeah, but it doesn't have pillars. Yeah. So the philosophical argument, what is that? What is that role? Is there a favorite one for you? Is there a fallback for you? Is there one that you like when you first heard it, you thought, Okay, that's that's gonna be tough to overcome. So this is a slight bit of a cop out because it doesn't prove God exists. But there's one I've talked to you guys a bit about called the evolutionary argument against naturalism. Okay. So would you like me to go into that? Please. I'm fascinated to hear that. That silence was definitely the Yep, keep going. Yes. So just to reiterate that is the evolutionary argument against naturalism that you're about you're going to unpack. Correct. Okay, so just trying to build suspense. Yeah. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Yeah. So the evolutionary argument against naturalism is not an argument for God. It's an argument against a belief called naturalism. So naturalism is the belief that all things that happen are explainable by natural causes. Right. So that's a bit different than let's say materialism, which is that the only substance, the only thing that really exists is material things, material stuff. But naturalism is the belief that you can explain everything by observation, by empirical science, just by the way nature runs. Okay. So if you're a naturalist, you believe in evolution. We could put some nuance on what evolution is. But it's basically a combination of sexual selection and natural selection. And natural selection. Right. So natural selection is when you have two animals that are competing in a given space. And one of them finds a little advantage, right, that they will survive for longer and have more children statistically, which means that their children are more likely genetically to have that trait. So pretty much everyone knows what evolution is, but just to restate that is kind of the foundation. They don't, but that's okay. Good. You're right. People listening to this podcast know that. They think they know. There's another, it doesn't really matter to the argument a whole lot, but there's sexual selection, which is why you have theoretically, you have peacocks with really vibrant colored spread of tail, right? Even though, you know, feathers, even though it gives them no natural selective advantage. It's basically just the guys trying to show off to somehow attract female evolutionary biologists don't know exactly how that works from what I understand. Right. Okay. So there's still some mystery to it, no doubt, but that's kind of the premise. Okay. So I'm going to set up a little story with Fred and George, the two cavemen. So if you're a naturalist, you believe humans evolved. Let's, so Fred and George are like, you know, Cro-Magnon humans. They're kind of fumbling around a little bit, but they've got some fire. They use clubs. Maybe they even use spears. So Fred and George run across a saber-toothed tiger. Fred believes that saber-toothed tigers are cuddly. And so he doesn't run away. George believes that he's going to die if he doesn't get away. So he runs and escapes. Okay. Who survives in that situation? Okay. George survives. Right. So he gets to go home to hit Helga. Wait, doesn't Fred get a pet? Fred gets a pet saber tooth out of this though, right? Is that how that works? That's how Disney does it. It was a puppy, but sorry, just kidding. So I was going to say, so we're assuming it eats him. Yes. Yes. So Fred, it eats Fred. He doesn't get to go back to, you know, Olga and have kids. So he doesn't pass on the gene. And, you know, this is all, you could go into scientific weeds here, but he passes on the gene. He passes on the gene. He does not pass on the gene. I think saber-toothed tigers are cuddly. Okay. So pretty quickly, you, Crow Maginons no longer believe that saber-toothed tigers are cuddly. Yep. They run away. All the ones who believe that are lunch. Are lunch. Exactly. So there's a problem with that. It is that let's run a different scenario. Let's say that Fred believes the saber-toothed tiger is cuddly, but he also believes that if he runs away from the saber-toothed tiger or fights it off, that later on in the day, the saber-toothed tiger will come back to him and he'll get to cuddle with him. It's ridiculous. It's a very dumb belief, but he has this belief. Okay. The belief, if I fight or run away from the saber-toothed tiger, later I'll get to cuddle with it. And he really wants to do that. George believes he's going to die if he doesn't run away or fight off the saber-toothed tiger. What do George and Fred both do in that situation? They both run away. Both run away. So let's say for the sake of the example, they both survive. They're both able to escape. Okay. So both genes get passed on. So you have the gene that has a very wrong, ridiculous belief that gets passed on. You also have a gene that passes on a true belief. The point is evolution can't select for truer beliefs. Okay. It only selects for behavior. So that might sound very counterintuitive because you might think, ah, but isn't it better to believe that if you fight with a spear rather than your bare fists, that you'll survive more likely. So that will take us a little bit farther afield into the definitions of, you know, different thoughts or beliefs. But in general, for every time you say a belief, like, let's say it's, you have to make a distinction between basically desires and between propositional beliefs. Like, let's see, what would be a propositional belief? This spear will help me kill the saber of tooth tiger more could be a propositional belief. Okay. But then, you know, a desire to fight or to run away would just be a desire. So of course, philosophers debate these things. But the main point is that it seems like for every propositional belief that you could give, or like, it's better to have a spear to attack the saber tooth tiger with, you could have another one that says something ridiculous, like the saber tooth tiger cuddle story, you can always come up with one that gets the same result. Okay, the same behavior, while having a false belief. But it allows them to survive. Right. That still allows them to survive and still passes on the genes. So the basic premise is that, or the argument is, evolution doesn't select or truer beliefs. Interesting. So what does that mean? It means that if you are a naturalist, so Alvin planning calls it, this is like philosophical jargon, but the beliefs that you have need to be held in are the probability of them being true, are either low or inscrutable. inscrutable just means you don't know. Right. In other words, you have no idea how true your beliefs are. Or, or even worse, you probably have mostly false beliefs. Because evolution is not selecting for truer beliefs. Which means that if you're a naturalist, you have reason to doubt your own naturalism and your own belief in evolution. Wow. Okay. Yeah, it's, it's the classic. So a naturalist should be doubting themselves based on their theory of natural selection. Basically, their theory of natural selection undermines all their beliefs. Interesting, including naturalism and evolution. Right. So if you believe that evolution is the source, or that natural processes are the only thing that can create a source for even beliefs. So that's what you're stuck with. So if you believe the only source for human thinking and beliefs is, or are natural processes, then you should be very dubious of your beliefs. Correct. That makes great sense. Yes. So yeah, so the different responses are maybe you can't count thoughts. So how can you know if it's like 5050, you're like, it's impossible to know, which kind of proves planning is point, right? There's other beliefs. There's other ways to try and like get around it. But I think it's a really solid argument. So basically, if you are, if you believe in God, you could believe in evolution, or in something else, you could believe in different like versions of intelligent design. Or you could believe in God and evolution. The problem for naturalists is their only option at this point is evolution. So, so yeah, it's really creepy. When I dug into it, like, actually, a lot of atheists kind of accept this. Like some neuroscientists who are materialists, people who study the brain. Wow. People who study the brain will basically say, yeah, we can't trust what we are perceptions at all. Which is terrifying. But they, I don't know how they hold to their own beliefs. But it just, that's something that could crumble. So or it feels like something that would crumble very easily. Yeah. Well, that was the for a while. Remember, remember for a while, one of the big pushes in atheism was that, that the only reason we're Christians are the only reason we believe in a God is because we evolved belief in a God. Right. And therefore we believe in God, which, which then would show that someone who's not doesn't believe in God either has a, I guess, an evolutionary error. But why does 96% of the world's population believe in some form of, you know, higher power or God? And they said, so how do you, so in other words, like, bam, you just believe in God because you've evolved that tendency. Our brains evolve that tendency. But of course, immediately Christian thinkers pointed out, well, then you believe in evolution because you evolved that belief. And so if evolving a belief causes you to doubt it, then you should be just in the same position. But it sounds like Planaga has taken it to a new level and said, actually, if you believe evolution is the only source or natural processes would be the only source for belief, you should be more dubious, right? Not less dubious because, because the theist has multiple sources, potential sources of belief, which some of them would be less dubious or potentially less dubious. Potentially. Yep. So again, it's not a proof for God, but it's definitely a very strong argument against naturalist. I think it's really cool. Yeah. It actually reminds me a little bit when you, when we reverse stuff like that of the problem of evil that we've talked about, that when people say that when you realize the problem of evil, if you remove God, if you say, how can there be a God with this kind of loving God, if there's this kind of suffering, removing the loving God from the scenario does not in any way reduce or explain the suffering. It just means it's random and meaningless versus with a Christian perspective, you can say, oh, but there is a benevolent God who can assign meaning and bring value from that suffering supernaturally. Whereas the naturalist is stuck with, nope, it's just flat suffering and horror. And there is no purpose and there is no meaning that can be, that can come from that. So that kind of reminds me of that. Like, no, that the, this may be bad, but the only other option is worse. Yes. Yeah. I mean, it's been around for a lot. Like you said, it's been around for a long time. Like since Freud has talked about religion being the opiate for the masses, right? Like, yeah, but you have to apply. So it could be true. Like that's the thing is it could be true that we believe in Christianity because of evolution, right? It doesn't tell us why that's true or false. So in other words, unless you also show that evolution tends to lead to more false beliefs than not. Right. Right. Then, so basically, yeah, you're stuck with like, yes, maybe that's true, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's, it's less likely or more likely. Right. And maybe it is less likely, but you have to show that. You can't just say it. You can't just say it. That makes sense. But then there's an argument to be heard. That's a really encouraging argument. Yeah. Yeah. And it can be applied widely. Like, you know, dad already mentioned, like people say, well, you only believe that because X, Y, and Z. Like probably there are some cases otherwise, right? If you're a schizophrenic and you're, you believe in a lot of paranoid, like paranoid things, something's going to come get you or that there are aliens listening from your walls. Like that's probably, you have reason to doubt that belief because yeah, you are compromised, but you can show why that person is compromised in their beliefs. Right. And again, I think this goes back to this, this kind of argument is why people nowadays are moving towards the, well, we don't know what's true. Right. Because you could take that argument to mean it's just that we don't know whether things are true or not. And that is kind of the base assumption of a lot of people nowadays and their beliefs is if it works for you, it works for you. Right. Yeah. And that is, that's probably, so then the question becomes, even, even if Christians do a great job of winning the battle, even if the, even if, even if apologists and philosophers did a great job of winning the battle of saying, no, naturalism is not the best answer. We still have to then offer up a good, a series of good rational answers. Totally. Yes. Yes. Which, you know, can be done in all different kinds of ways. And I've already talked about how I consider my faith, the kind of like tapestry, not a, or, you know, built on multiple pillars, not just one thing. Right. Yeah. That's good. Very cool. What else have you got any other questions for Mark or Mark, anything else to toss in there? Like, what is your encouragement for people who are, you know, struggling in some way with their faith or have deconstructed their faith? Like, how would you, what would you encourage them on next steps? And I'll add, if you have time, additional questions that I thought of is, what would you say to people who are in that, that point where they're like, there's no way of knowing. So why, you know, why, why try to reach a conclusion? Yeah, that's great. Good question. I'll start with the other ones first, because that those are easier. That's a really good question, friend. Difficult. But I would say, as an encouragement, it's interesting because the people that I think I've encouraged maybe most to high school kids who I remember, I don't remember their names, actually. One was from South spring a while ago, and then one was from my church I was attending in college called Stonegate. And there are two kids who had just stumbled on, you know, kind of like the audience with this podcast or the kids of the parents were listening to this podcast. Who are clearly brilliant, clearly have an insanely high IQ. I think if my cousin, even same situation where there's this active deconstruction that happens, partially because they're just so wickedly brilliant, that it's like they're running laps around their parents and around everyone else around them, you know. And I think that encouragement there for them and what I've been able to show those kids is the only thing I have an advantage on for them is that I was in college and I had studied these questions, whereas they were just really smart, you know, and had maybe been on a few atheist forums online and had seen the stuff to pull out. But for them to be encouraged, like you said, that there are arguments about this, there are answers for as many questions as have been posed to Christianity. There are people like edited profile and Alistair McGrath, who literally is a C.S. Lewis type, basically. I think he teaches at Oxford, but he has a doctorate in biophysics, a doctorate in history of thought, and a doctorate in philosophy. I think there's like three different PhDs all from Oxford. Wow. Pretty, pretty bright, probably. And guess what? You know, he's a Christian and he holds to Orthodox beliefs and he's even he's an ordained Anglican minister. So you have like, you just can't say if you have a certain level of IQ, you're going to be an atheist. That is the message you will get in academia. That is the message, especially in the science that you will get. But you realize that they're built on assumptions, not on evidence one way or another, especially in the sciences. Like science is important and help us understand apologetics questions. It's important for other reasons. But God is not a falsifiable claim by science. In other words, science is about measuring physical things. So you can't physically measure something that is immaterial. Okay, right, right. So just by the nature of the question. So anyway, insights like that, basically getting them connected with people like Alistair McGrath, getting their books in the hands of kids who are deconstructing is important, because they need to know that there are other brilliant people who are also Christian. Mm hmm. Um, just as many times as they are not Christian. Um, I'm not saying that one way or the other. It's not like really smart people always choose Christianity because they don't. And then for Bryn's question, and what was, can you restate it again? Like you're saying with the trend of just kind of settling with there's so many things that we can't know, or, or even the concept of we can't know for sure. So I'm gonna say I'm agnostic, or whatever it is. What that current trend and kind of, is that I mean, I have heard a lot of, especially Gen Z, saying that they want to be so open minded, and there's no way of knowing for sure. So I'm just going to stay there. What is your encouragement to find answers and to move past that stage? Hmm, that's good. So I think my encouragement is for people to encourage them in their open mindedness. So step one is basically saying I see that you're very open minded and open to other beliefs. Just because you follow Christ doesn't mean you have to give that up. So I think some things you have to sacrifice to follow Christ. And in a sense, you do have to sacrifice the open mindedness open mindedness, because you have to say, whatever Christ says, He's king. And so what He says goes, right, there, there is that sense. But in the intellectual sense, you can be very open minded about many different things. And I think what you need to remember is that as long as you can keep the idea that there is truth in the back of your head, while you're searching, I think that's the best option. So in other words, like be open minded. And just remember while you're searching, that you're looking for truth. Because and you can show that really easily that you have to look for truth, right? Like you can't just blindly wander. And I think that encouragement to say you can wander and seek and look. If you're honest, then if you seek and knock, then it will be open to you. And so if you if you hold the openness truth, the humility to think maybe I'm wrong, and hold there is such thing as truth, and that's what I'm looking for, that can start you on the right track on your compass. Like instead of going, you know, following Christ and following everything He teaches would be like going like true north, exactly north. But I think what I would encourage for Gen Z is to actually have a compass at all. You know, like just start with recognizing that there is a compass. Yeah. And I think to get them there, there are arguments or just simple things to show them that that's true. I don't think it's that difficult to show them that there is a compass. You know, showing them that Christianity is that following Christ is true north is another thing. Right. But while they're looking for that true north, encouraging them to open and seek and look at like, even dad, I'm sure on the podcast, you've talked about your own spiritual, your own seeking where you had a couple of years where you really rigorously looked into other religions. Right. And like, yeah, do that. But I think what our generation is missing is not the seeking part, it's almost having a compass at all. And being willing to accept an answer, even when you achieve it, or even when you get there, like, claiming you know something is not the same as claiming you know everything. Totally. So you're allowed to put something into space and go, you know, I, I think this really is true. Like I have now been convinced of this. That doesn't make you close minded. It just means you have done the point of all the work. Yes. And if you hold that belief, what would make you close minded is if you said, I'm not going to listen to any other thoughts, no other arguments, I'm not even going to consider it being wrong. Yeah, that's close minded. Don't be close minded. You know, yeah, I don't need to. That's different. That's Yeah. And I think, as long as we can make that distinction between what true open mindedness is, as opposed to, you know, a true open mindedness is empathetic. It's maybe you are right, not none of us can be right. Wow. It's, you know, I think I'm right about this position, but I could be wrong, as opposed to neither you or I is right or wrong. Yeah, so what a good delineation. Wow. Yeah, I think like the it used to be a problem that people just, it seems like I don't know if this is actually true, but it seems like people used to not want to seek as much in the past few decades. Now it's people are seeking, but they're trying to do it without a compass without finding, without finding. Yeah, I want to see. I just don't want to find. And I think one final note on that is you are fooling yourself if you think that you don't have any assumptions, right, that you don't believe there is a right or wrong. Yeah, like it's just so simple to show that otherwise. I really think a lot of gyms don't think that I think they have the belief that that's not the case. But it's very easy to show that otherwise. So yeah, I would just say it's like, really, like, a good place to start is, is there a difference between taking care of a puppy and finding a stray puppy and torturing it? Let's just start with that. Is there a difference? Not even just which one is right and wrong? Is there a moral difference? And that's just an open question. Like, is it? Okay, yes, there is a difference. Which one is right, which one is wrong? Okay, there's right and wrong. Okay, so then we can just work from backwards. Okay, this is clearly wrong. And then work backwards from what's obviously wrong. You know, racism is obviously wrong. Let's define that. What is that? That's wrong. So what's right? And then you just move in that direction, you say, okay, well, then you do believe in right and wrong. You do make judgments. So that's just what I would, I would argue is you can be a seeker of truth while still being reminded. That's great. That's, that's really good. I think that's, and I think that's something that will be encouraging for our listeners who are in that place. Yeah, I think your, I think your story, and I think the insights in this episode have been really helpful. And I think it's a great place for people. I agree. It also, I think also delineating like what is, you know, what is true open-mindedness? It kind of lends itself to what, you know, Chris, what you've told us several times of like, I've tried to get into these open-minded discussion boards. Yeah, yeah. And no one wants me. We want our own version of free thinking. No one else. So it's like, oh, I think that's also just a good reiteration of let's understand what that is. And we don't have to check our minds at the door. Yeah. And I think being free thinking and open-minded is a concept that everyone loves. And it's something that we want to claim about ourselves, but the work of actually knowing what that means in a healthy way and actually doing the work to be that way is like sometimes painful and really difficult. And so it's sometimes it's more like, we just want to feel like we're open-minded, you know, or feel like we've arrived at the answers or whatever version of that is. And it's a fun thing to claim, but then it's like, have we actually put in the work to know, like you're saying, know what that actually means and then to actually be. Yeah, yeah. That is so true. That is one of the most prominent, I claim it for myself and yet isn't actually true out there. Right. Yeah. Like, oh man, that's such a good insight. Like that is one of the top things, like claiming humility for yourself. Everyone would claim to be humble. Everyone would claim to be open-minded. Nowadays, everyone would claim to be open-minded, but are they really? And the answer is that that's such a great point. Typically no. Yeah. Because humans, humans just aren't, we're not very open-minded. We have moments maybe of open-mindedness, but that's about as far as we get. Yeah. Wonderful. Well, Mark, Mark, thank you for, for being on, for sharing your thoughts, for sharing your story. And I'm confident that this will meet our listeners wherever they are on their journey. And I'm sure it will help one, spur them on to be thinking maybe in a different way, but also just to be encouraged by your faith through hard questions of life. I appreciate it. Yep.
