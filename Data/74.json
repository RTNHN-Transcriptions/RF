We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Legge and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime Bryn Starnes and Chris Legge. And guys, glad to be back in the studio with you. Yeah, always great. We're jumping into another listener question. It's another anonymous question. And so, should I read this first paragraph? Yeah, I think that'd be good. I think it'd be good. And then Chris will address it and we'll kind of have a conversation around that. First of all, thank you whoever sent this in for asking us a question. On a couple of recent podcasts, this was several ago, Pastor Legge mentioned his reluctance to make actions illegal through legislation that which the Bible teaches against. As one example, he said that while adultery is wrong biblically, he wasn't sure that he would vote for legal consequences for an adulterer. Rather, he said he would probably come down on the side of quote freedom instead of trying to turn biblical principles into laws. And he goes on to say, I'm not sure if I'm stating this position correctly, but is this the correct position? And so that's kind of where I want to jump off with. Is that what you were actually saying, Chris? And then can we unpack that a little bit? That's a great question and I appreciate the follow up. I think that's great. So let's go back to kind of the big principle here. And because one of the things that concerns me, especially in the conversation of deconstruction and how that plays out in politics, I think often happens when we allow or encourage people to confuse things with faith, especially when we encourage it. When we confuse faith and politics, for example, it's not that either one of those, of course they overlap and of course they, like we talked about how everyone needs to vote their own conscience and that's important. At the same time, what do we look for our government to do? What do we want it to accomplish? And I think one of the things I am extremely hesitant about is asking the government to support church doctrine. And part of that's because they seem to become inextricable when that begins to happen and people begin to see politics and law even as inextricable as like now they're together and we can't get them back apart. I tell people it's like, we see this in marriage right now as a huge issue in the United States is that at one point the government stepped in and said, hey, the way you guy, and actually the questioner actually further down asks about like the protection of marriage act and stuff like that. And so the government came in and said, hey, we're right there with Christian values when it comes to marriage, that we want to help protect this idea that you can only be married to one person at a time and that both spouses are protected when either one of them is a problem and that the children are protected when they're together and there's certain rights like visiting you in your hospital bed or being an automatic inheritor like you automatically inherit if your spouse dies and you have no will you automatically inherit everything. Well, the government like, yeah, yeah, we're all we're on board for all of that. And we want there to be rules and laws about how you can get divorced and limitations on how you can do that. And we want to be a part of the marriage process, which had not been necessarily a government role in the past. And the role of government in marriage was pretty non-substantial, if anything, around most of the world. So, well, okay. And most of the world... And most of history. So marriage licenses and that kind of thing. Probably at least your great grandparents, their marriage was recorded in the family Bible, not in a state document. And so that whole concept of the government coming in and saying, we want to support your values. So we're going to create laws about that. We're going to create rules about that. We're going to create standards. We're going to create departments of the government that are all about all these things, which seems great when it happens. But then one, from our perspective, the deconstruction problem is then how can I deconstruct my faith in the government and not be deconstructing my faith in the Bible or in Christianity because they're so linked when it comes to this. And also the, I don't know, skeptic, cynic in me would say, what we have seen in regards to marriage is an evidence of why it's not a good idea to link the government. We go all the way back to the leader of the church, which was it Frederick? Whichever emperor it was that the Bishop of Rome, I think it was, made him the emperor. And at that moment, it's like, oh, the church decides who the emperor is. Oh, that's how this, the church and the king are now inextricable. And they depend on each other. And down the road, you've got Henry VIII trying to convince the bishop, the patriarch, to cancel his weddings or his marriages. And it just gets really ugly very quickly when we see these things link. And so I'm super hesitant when something's only, no, hear me say that your only argument for something is biblical doctrine. I'm hesitant to ask the government to step in. No, please do. My other question is kind of going off of that because I think some people would like to see it linked. Yeah, absolutely. What you're saying we see it be, why? Why is it, why would, what would your response be like, why is it, why does it become dangerous? I just think because the government is not trustworthy because it's, it's humans without the power of divine intervention in our, in their hearts. So what we see happen is exactly what happened. Again, early on, I actually think probably the motivation behind this was relatively solid. Now, in regards to marriage, part of it was actually probably an anti-Mormon sentiment is that, is it because Mormonism had come over to America and they were engaged in polygamy and the US government was not a fan of the Mormon church. One way they could kind of control the Mormon church was to start creating marriage laws. And so I think there's, as always, it seems like there's always an ugly, I don't know, affair, something that seems wrong to get started when you start getting in, like start climbing in bed together. But, and wouldn't you say too, it is easily switched. Like as soon as someone else is in power, they're going to apply the same concept, but, then enact laws that aren't in line with, they may think it's in line with their religion or their whatever, but it's, it easily can become that thought followed to its end, won't support biblical Christianity as soon as the people in authority don't adhere to a biblical worldview. That's right. And that's what we've seen happen, especially with the progressive thought of, of changing and improving and whatever at all times, which means throwing the past away across time is, is that you're left with then what happens when the government says, yeah, we, we are who we're, we're the people who, who protect marriage. We're the ones who define marriage. We're the ones who decide who's married and who's not. And it's an hour, right? That we protect. And so now we have to decide from a government perspective who gets to be married and who doesn't get to be married and what marriage means and what its protections are. And all of a sudden it becomes very, very messy. And, and then like, like Brandon was saying, what happens when the government separates itself out from the church in such a way to say, wait a minute, we, we want to now follow a totally different agenda, but we're taking those church concepts, those religious concepts, and we're now making them government concepts. And we're holding to our view as a moral. Right. I think that's what we're seeing with a lot of things that are anti-biblical, but are, but the people that believe in them still believe that it's a right and wrong. Right. Like we, they still believe that to not give someone freedom to marry who they want is an immoral thing. Is an immoral act. That's right. You're being bigoted or racist or judgmental or something. And part of it is they have the backing of the government who we supported at one point that we said, no, we want you involved in this. We're glad you're involved with this. We're proud you're involved with this. And then later to come back and say, no, now we want you to not be involved in this. We want to create a whole amendment to the constitution protecting the original definition of marriage. And there is a difference in that, by the way, there is a difference with what I think the job of the government is versus what the job of the church is. They overlap a lot, but like I think of legal, you know, legal philosophy probably has more to do with harm from a crime perspective than it does with pure morality. So it is morality. People who say you can't legislate morality. That's ridiculous. Of course you can and we do all the time. But not all legislation is morality. And part of that's because morality is an internal experience sometimes. And so to say why someone did something versus what they did. Well, the law has a really hard time with motivation that becomes malice is the hardest thing for the law to prove is I've got to prove that there was malice in your heart. I mean, I was like, I can trick you into doing it or have you recorded doing it? It's hard to prove. So that's why I'm saying, you know, I don't know. And if I got called on the carpet and there was an actual moment and there was a, we were going to make, because I do believe in the sanctity of marriage. I do believe that that's a good thing and a healthy thing in a community and that the church should police that, so to speak, the church should monitor that and help people and come alongside them and confront them in that with other Christians. But I'm not convinced that that's the government's job. I'm also not convinced that it's not, I'm just saying, but I'm not convinced that it is. And I'm nervous every time the government steps in and from a deconstruction perspective, we have a whole generation now that in a very short amount of time, for example, pretty much everyone agreed that marriage was between a man and a woman, an adult man and adult woman. And that's what marriage meant. That wasn't a moral statement. It was a definitional statement. This is what the word marriage means. And then what happened is the government in opposition. So all these things were, there were even laws passed to protect this. The Supreme Court came and said, Nope, you can't do that. Marriage any American citizen can be married to any other American citizen. That's how, as long as they're adults. And that's the new definition. Even within a year, the majority of Americans agreed with that. So what caused that change? It was the legal change that caused Americans to change their view on this. And so that didn't happen with abortion, but it did when they thought that would happen with abortion, but it didn't. But with this, it did. And so back to this, back to this or the other question from last episode about, you know, have we changed our view? Marriage hasn't changed its views in 3000 years or 2000 years. And the questioner said, but they have. Well, that's this question. Yeah, they have. And why did they? Well, because we invited the government in to redefine the, to have a role that allowed them to redefine things later. And I don't know that I want the government defining what makes marriage sacred or what counts as an affair and what doesn't count as an affair. And what, like, I don't know that I want the government involved in that because what happens when they take that ball and go home? I think I think we could see a huge deconstruction again. And I think we have seen a deconstruction in that. So but you're saying just to clarify, though, you're saying in, in matters of morality, but not necessarily like protection of. So like protection of life would be a safety protection standpoint. Right. That is a harm issue, a true harm issue. But then you're saying this would be different because it's morality. I mean, not harm in the same way. Not harm in the same way. Obviously. Yeah, I'm not talking about cycle. I don't know that that's another held whole other conversations with that. That's why those are different in your mind. Yes. As far as what you would be OK with voting for the not to get into your voting record. Exactly right. What you would be OK with the government getting involved in. So I know, for example, and the question asked what my perspective was. So I know I would support laws to protect, for example. The question was, would you vote for it? Exactly. I don't I don't usually get that kind of option if I was a senator, would I vote for anyway? But the but in this situation, like if you're talking about I'm a big fan of laws that protect women or men from physical abuse, for example, or from other criminal activity, like if you know you can't be kidnapped or you can't have your property stolen from you or you can't whatever. And and so I'm a fan of of those type of laws. I don't know where I would come down on. And I don't know how many other examples these are like like the Bible teaches that rest is is good for us. I don't know that I would want our government, although they've done it in the past. They there were blue laws when I was a kid that meant you couldn't go to certain places on Sunday. And it isn't that here's the deal. It isn't that I don't think it's not beneficial or best for people to follow those rules. It is a moral issue that we do those that we don't have affairs, that we are faithful to our spouse. You don't care about that issue. No, that's I know I'm massively passionate about it. And yet I don't that's almost part of why I don't know if I want the government getting involved. So they mess up everything they touch. And when when we talk about the government then defining morality, you know, I've heard the term like, well, is it a net positive or a net negative thrown out of like, you know, we'll we'll adhering to that, like, as a is for for the for the culture for our country is the outcome of this a net positive. Interesting. Yeah, these different things happen. That determines the problem with that is you would start mandating church attendance. Right. And that's what I'm saying is like, hey, hey, hey, I feel like that's really hard, though. Yeah, like putting that is the true nanny state. But like putting putting that in the government's hands does seem difficult because it's like, okay, now you're now you really are saying, okay, you're defining we're letting somebody else to find what a positive is for right for us. What is a negative? That's a good question. Because I feel like there are a lot of Christians who might disagree with that and say, no, in hopes that the government would return to its more traditional Christian ethic. I want to vote for all these things. And I think they should, you know, like, right. I mean, I think that's a stance. I agree. And I don't know that that's wrong. Yeah. But here's so here's the other piece of it's tough for me. Yeah. And so one of them that that's what we've been talking about one of them. And another one is God could enforce that the thought of the government enforcing these laws is tough for me. Because we don't see even God enforcing a lot of these in the moment. That's like, yes, we're supposed to continue to gather together with unbelievers, but but you don't see people skip church and then get sick because they skipped church or get struck dead or get locked up in paralyzed like God could enforce these in a in a very clear way. Because it's God's will that every that no one should perish, but that all should come to know that the saving grace of his son. But he doesn't force that in the classic sense. Now, in the big picture, he's rescuing us from the consequences of his wrath against our sin. So I guess there's some form of enforcement down there eventually in judgment. But but in the moment, it seems to me like God, God does God gives us a lot of freedom on how we decide our own consequences. And he says, this is my plan for best, your best life, right in me. But he doesn't force us to follow it. But focusing on our conversation about deconstruction, I think this is the kind of thing that confuses people as to women is your faith in God or is your faith in the government? And so is can can God guide his people to stay faithful? Or do you need government agents to guide your people to stay faithful? And and that to me is again, all of these fall apart at some point. And I'm sure our listeners and probably especially the guy asking the question or girl asking question would ask the they would come up with examples immediately of like, well, what about this and what about this? I'm not offering a clear delineation for how to think about this. Instead, I'm intentionally kind of muddying the waters saying, I think these are muddy waters and I want us to see them as muddy, not well, we need to mandate prayer in school. Like every kid needs to pray to open the day in school. And and or every teacher needs to be able to sign off on the Ten Commandments or every classroom should have the Ten Commandments in them. Do I think all of those things would make a better world if people did those things freely? Absolutely. Absolutely. If if everyone followed just the Ten Commandments. Yeah, I mean, everyone's life would become bordering on utopia, because we had no more fear of people stealing our stuff, taking our life, you know, judging us, all the different things that would change. But I'm not convinced that it is the US government's job to now mandate that that no one make idols or that no one because that's the ultimate. If we're saying, well, you know, we need to we need to mandate or legal make make it illegal to disobey God in regards to the affairs, then I'm like, well, the most important commandment is to honor him as God. Should we make that a law as well that everyone has to honor, you know, Yahweh and Jesus Christ as God, and that would be problematic, obviously, which like the extreme version of this is like an Islamic State, right? Take into another extreme of saying mandate, which I it seems like it would create not that I know there are very a lot of devout people in Islam, Islamic States. But if if you mandated everything, then it seems like it would breed hypocrisy, because then you're serving God out of fear. We've certainly seen I mean, the Jewish, the Old Testament Jewish people are a wonderful example of people who lived in a theocracy that they were unable and unwilling to follow for any long period of time, even with divine intervention, like even that didn't do it. And we'll see that again. So I prefer for laws to leave people with the freedom to make these decisions under God as long as it's not causing now, this is not morality, this is legality. So here, these are two different things. Some people say morality is about not causing harm. I disagree with that. There, there are responsibilities and duties when we're, you know, when we're in that situation. But the idea of legal legal law, most law should probably revolve around not causing harm, especially with malice. Not just how do we mandate positive good behavior, you have to give 10%. You know, should that be a government thing that you turn in your taxes, and if you haven't given 10% to the church, or something that the government confiscates and gives it to a religious institution, I wouldn't be a fan of that, even though I think that'd be a very good thing for everyone to choose to do, to do at least 10%. So and my fear would be if imagine if the government was in the job of confiscating 10% and giving it to a religious organization, I mean, that would take what one generation before the government's like, I think probably 8% is plenty, we'll keep the other two. Or the 10% is going to this other thing. Yeah, exactly. Well, isn't there a quote about like, maybe it's just the concept of whoever wields the sword, like when when you're in, when you're in line with them, you like it, but then it switches, you don't want them to have the sword. Exactly right. I don't know what the quote is. But yeah, that's a that's a good concept. So that's the end. The answer to that question is, you know, there are some I don't know where I would take the stance on. There are others that I think are that cause direct harm, like theft, like murder, that I would say, yeah, those should be laws, every government needs to protect those. What is the government's role when it comes to sanctity of marriage? I really don't know. In the last 10 years, I've hovered nearer to nothing, that it has no role whatsoever when it comes to sacred sanctity of marriage. I don't should the government identify them, recognize them, whatever, like, I don't know that they should. I don't know that any of the government's business at all to be involved in marriage. Marriage predates government marriage, you know, predates nations, it predates more than a few people like, so I don't know, I wrestle with that one. And I know there are examples. And there's probably places where I could be called out on hypocrisy with this that, that I've said something somewhere along the line that like, well, then you shouldn't have said that. And they're in, you're probably right. I probably there are lines that I'm, I haven't thought through this all the way. But those are my main, I think it causes a lot of deconstruction. When we're talking about politics and deconstruction, it is when we integrate those two things in unhealthy ways. And then one goes away, or one leads people astray. And the other one feels like, well, now I'm being drafted, cancel them both. And that's tough. Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think I wonder if also the the questioner was saying was thinking along the lines too of like, okay, I'm already, I'm already voting and thinking about politics with my, with my Christian lens, you know, my conscience as a believer is being led by the Holy Spirit. Yeah. And so if that's, if that's the case, yeah, how, why don't, why don't I just extrapolate that onto everything? Right. Yeah. Well, he says what is wrong with our representatives, like making laws that support the laws of God. And I don't think you were saying it's wrong. You were just saying you don't know that it's, it's always best. Right. Exactly. It's wrong if someone does that. I think it's always dangerous. Yeah. That doesn't mean it's wrong. There's a lot of good things that are that are dangerous. There's a lot of very positive things. Being a missionary is dangerous. It's a very good thing. So I think it's dangerous and we need to be aware of it. And part of it is I just think it has become in the past because America was so well founded with a couple of exceptions that it became natural even for Christians to go, Oh, the government will take care of that instead of saying, no, no, no, wait a minute. That's our job. What's, what's we, we need to, the government should have said, Hey, we have a real problem in America with welfare. Hey church, you need to get your act together and start taking care of people instead of necessarily creating a massive welfare state. Maybe that should have been the church going, wow, we, we need to get kicked in the pants. And if we were taking care of widows and orphans as we're instructed to do, we wouldn't be seeing the government feel that even the need to step in. Interesting. So, so here's what's wild. Remember, so this question that we got, remember that not that long ago we had this question. I don't believe Christians have the right or authority just because they vote to push their version of how they think everyone should live on a nation full of people with all kinds of faiths and beliefs. So that question reveals why this question, why I gave the statement that in get, that initiates this question, meaning that this, this is how a lot of people interpret Christians integrated into politics is that we're trying to force ideals that aren't, that are purely biblical ideals. And, and so we have to be careful with how we do that. Yes, vote our conscience. And I'm not telling somebody else that if they think there should be a sanctity of marriage act, they should vote for it. I'm not saying they're wrong to do so. I'm just super hesitant. I just am so gun shy almost literally about the government's role in our lives. Because in my lifetime, I've watched the government so many times say, no, we support you on this. Oh, no, actually we're in charge of it. And waffling back and forth. You're in charge. We're following you. You're lead church. And then actually, no, we're in charge now and you have to follow our lead. And it turns out we gave them that crowbar and they're not using it. And we just probably were better off never giving it in the first place. Yeah. So anyway, that probably gets me on a list. Let list. So I guess also, I'm going to go watch every talk you've done on politics. I'm trying to find a line of, yeah. But as far as that is concerned, then your view, Chris, of government, it seems like. And I don't know. I don't know if we want to walk down this. Go for it. Go for it. Go for it. But what I was thinking is like, okay, then your view of that is like limit the government. Yeah. For reasons of we to maximize freedom. Yeah. So I do fall into, though I am socially, certainly at the personal level, you know, I am rather libertarian. If you could use the terminology in the old classical definition of libertarian, maybe even the old classical definition of liberal, even though, you know, I don't fall, as we said, I don't fall neatly into any of those. And neither does anybody else as much as we think they do. But I do, I have always, Colson, been intrigued by the phrase that government, which governs best, governs least. And I think there's something to that. I think there's something to human flourishing, being connected to human freedom, and that we're probably best off when governments do what is only necessary versus more than what is necessary. And I'm a little bit of a traditionalist. I think when I read the founding fathers, I hear people saying stuff that I think, you know, I think they I think not all not all of it. And I've said that several times. Right. But there's a generalized sense in which they saw a highly hamstrung and restricted central government. And and given given their background, yeah, with other historical governments, that would make sense. And so I'm a fan of that. And I would. So that that is true. You certainly call that out correctly. At the same time, there is a because there is partially a distrust and part of what I've seen the government say one thing and then say something almost the opposite right afterwards. And and so I'm a I am a big fan of us finding these answers in the most ancient tradition, meaning between in the community of believers, which, you know, the family, friendship, the church, our individual relationships with God. And I think the CS Lewis talks about this, for example, in Scrutate proposes a toast in another places, that when we do start mixing these things together, we're now it's like we've taken our game and we're trying to play it on the enemy's field. No, that doctor would that back to that picture of Dr. Evans gives of the football analogy that we're the referees, I feel like when we're in dangers, when we say, hey, whichever one of you will do this thing for us, we'll join your team. And I don't think that's ever our job. But I think it feels that way sometimes. And so whichever one of you will do what we want, we're on your team, it should be whichever one of you is in alignment with the rules and with what God teaches us right now, you have our support in that way. So if you're not holding, we're not going to throw a flag. But if you are holding, we'll throw a flag. I think that's a good picture for us. I think that's a really good picture. And I also think if someone is listening and they haven't listened to kind of our unpacking of patriotism, of nationalism kind of thing, I think it would be valuable to hear that, not only for themselves, but just to get an accurate understanding of where we're coming from, because I feel like you do a good job of talking about your citizenship being in the kingdom of heaven. And as believers, that is the highest authority. And so then we are respectful of the authority structure. And it is funny, things come out as we sit and talk about these things from the perspective of deconstructing. And I think to my friends and family members who are deconstructing, and here we are, however many episodes in, and the earliest ones are some of the main things, but it is fascinating to me how many people this integration of politics and religion is just so distasteful to them, and they've seen it abused. And so I think all of us need to be careful to recognize politics and religion are not the same thing. They aren't interchangeable concepts. They had better not be. And to the degree we're putting our faith in human beings, so we've said a thousand times we need to deconstruct our faith and ourselves. So that's doubly true of when you put us in power, that our faith, we can't build our faith in one another or in politics to save us. And if you do, you will be disappointed. I promise, no matter what your viewpoint is, if you think, oh, you know what, they'll help us save this, whatever this agenda is for the day. No, I mean, they may right now, and then they'll turn on you. And that's not, I'm not being anti-government. Government is a necessary thing. I am just recognizing humans do that. And so we can't place our faith there. And people do, or they watch others do it. They watch pastors do it. They watch youth ministers do it. They watch their parents do it. And they do it, and then it falls apart on them. And what happens is the entire thing gets deconstructed when, I mean, it's like they've built a building out of bricks made up of religion and politics, God and president, whatever. And then when they have to deconstruct president, whatever, these got these God bricks kind of all fall down too. And that was the mistake was building them integrated like that. So anyway, we see it. And so that's part of why you get the phrase like me saying, I'm not sure how I would feel about that. It's a good question. It's a great question. Yeah. Well, thank you, listener, for asking. Chris, thanks for answering. Yep. And see you in the next episode. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
