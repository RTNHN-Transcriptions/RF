We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg and we are starting a new season today of the Reconstructed Faith podcast. And we're talking at least in this series, we don't really know how long this is going to go. Welcome to us. Are you new to the podcast? Exactly. If you are. We're terrible at that. But we want to be good about being thorough and asking hard questions and answering or responding to questions that also come up from our listeners. I just got a comment. I just, you know, one of the podcasts I admire a lot is the Bible Project podcast and they started a series at the beginning of 2022 going through the five books of the Torah. And they said, we're not sure how long this is going to take. We're going to try to unpack this. You know, the bit by bit and well, they just finished. Oh, wow. So it's they were like, well, it took a year. We had no idea it was going to take a year. So yeah. Anyway, they seem so much better organized than us. But yeah, maybe it turns out anyway, it's that's a lot better. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure the depths of those. Oh gosh. Five books. And so anyway, we're not jumping into the Torah. No, we're right now. You're actually going to be talking about politics in relation to deconstruction. That's right. And so if I were to throw it over to you, Bryn, what is kind of your thought initially thesis statement? Yeah. When we bring this up and then we can throw it to Chris and we're really just trying to intro where we are and we're going to start jumping in with terms. Yeah. Which we which we often like to do to start something new. Yeah, I would say initially if anyone panicked and is about to quit here now, just don't want another political commentary. Yeah. Give us a minute because I know that's I feel like that's scary. And that's one of the reasons that we're doing this is the fact that if you are listening to a podcast, specifically a Christian podcast, and they even say the word politics, a lot of our initial reaction would be a groan of some kind of like, Oh gosh, I know we're going to know where this is going to go, or I don't want to know where this is going to go. And so, but that kind of points to part of the reason that we're doing this is we have realized that just in our culture right now, there are a lot of people who are deconstructing because of politics and specifically like politics and theology being combined in a way that isn't helpful, isn't godly and are deconstructing either because of the politics of maybe their churches or their families, their parents, the way that their communities have handled politics. And it has been so closely tied with Christianity in a way that is harmful to them that it's caused deconstruction. And so, yes, with that in mind, we just have a heart of like the purpose of this whole podcast is to address different areas of our life that that we do want to deconstruct. And so we don't want to ignore this one. But part of our our purpose in this is just more to talk about how politics and faith integrate, like what is appropriate, how to make informed decisions as an engaged believer, and when engaging with with others, but not necessarily like our goal is not to tell you what to think on each issue as you come away from this, these episodes. And so we have talked about multiple times in our episodes that our citizenship is primarily of heaven and not of a party or even a country. And so part of our goal in this is reminding us that our allegiance is to God above party or platform. And but also politics are important to some degree. And so how do we do that well? And how do we in your speaking to like us and people who claim to be Christians, right? That's kind of where we're coming from. If you are listening to it and you're skeptical of Christianity, you've kind of walked away. I have no idea where you're at listening, but just know that like that's where we're coming from. And so that's kind of you can understand that that's kind of the assumption that we're making. Yeah. And even like defining some terms so that if you are someone who has deconstructed because of politics, maybe helping give some clarity of, hey, this, this political issue or term is not the same as like, it's not equated with all of Christianity. That's right. And I think some of that clarity will hopefully really help any of our listeners that are deconstructing who have been around people who have combined things that shouldn't aren't equated or have experienced the consequences of people combining them. Yeah. I mean, we've heard about that from many friends, those who have strong faith, those who have deconstructed their faith and others, the difficulty of having parents or family members who who they're there, what they call Christianity really is just a political stance. Yes. And, and I mean, one of the words we'll have to define before we're done is hypocrisy, because I feel like that is always a part of the question of deconstruction is when we run into something that we know what is being presented isn't what is real. And any faith that requires you to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, if I may quote the Wizard of Oz there, it's, it's hiding something and there's something wrong there. And it may not be the faith statement. It may not be the truth of the faith that's hiding something, but the person who's trying to hide something rather than reveal is. And so we run into that all the time. And we do go into this political conversation with fear and trepidation, I think. You will, we will work hard to be careful not to endorse any party or any person for multiple reasons. One, that would not be a good use of our time, in my opinion, it wouldn't be a good use of what we're doing. It's not, it's not who we are while we're here. It also would be actually offensive to the law. There's such a thing as the Johnson Amendment that as a, as a church, though individuals, we certainly have freedom of speech and we can say what we want and all that. And I embrace that. I also recognize that the government has said, hey, don't, as a church, we don't want you to be, you know, endorsing a certain candidate or certain, and I agree with that. As a church, I don't think that's our job and I don't, I don't want to do that. I don't want the consequences of that. A couple of years, a few years ago, I wrote an article, this was a dubious distinction, but I wrote an article about the Johnson Amendment and had an atheist organization reach out and ask if they could republish my article that was in support of the Johnson Amendment. And they were like, can we republish that on our material as you as a Christian leader and pastor supporting it? And I was like, I mean, I guess it's out there. I'm happy with you to do that. But how that felt a little strange, but it was still, it was great. But I'm a fan of that. I don't want our church to become a political tool or the wing of a political party. And yeah, I'm not a fan of that. And even when it comes to specific issues, like we may mention them and we've mentioned them in the past, like, of course, certain political issues when it comes to being a believer and thinking of how to critically think about these things. But I think if our goal is not to even specifically tackle all of those, because I mean, that would be another year in my mind of podcasts to do that well and to hear believers who think different things on those. And we would want to do those justice. And that's important, but not our primary purpose. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's good. And then the other thing is, like, I also think of, you know, you're talking about endorsing one party over another. We have a newly elected US congressman who is a member of our church. And so it's like, we are going to, to use your term, we're going to keep the lights on. We're going to adhere to what the Bible says. And if somebody who is aligned a certain way politically chooses to be a part of the church, that doesn't mean, well, we're endorsing every single thing that somebody like... Do you know what I'm saying? So you referenced a second ago, maybe this is when we go ahead and reference the phrase separation of church and state. Because I mean, what you just said makes a great example of it in that. So I'm a government teacher at times, every four years or so I teach a government class, and I'm in the middle of teaching it right now. And this is one of, we just went through constitutional law. What does the constitution say? And I give these poor students like 20 statements and ask which of them are from the constitution, and none of them are. They usually miss about half of them until they catch the pattern. But this is one of them. The word state, separation, and sure, none of those individual words appear in the constitution in any form. So where did that come from? Okay, so it actually came from a letter that it's typically given credit to Thomas Jefferson, although there were people talking in these terms before him. But back in the early 1800s, a letter that Thomas Jefferson sent, and you can look up the letter, the actual letter online and read it. But the idea, even from the beginning, from the First Amendment, which talks about the government establishing no religion, all of the constitution was created to protect the people from the government. Now there's certainly a sense in which it also protects the government from the people in a mob format, but that was not its real purpose. The purpose was to protect the people from the government. The constitution was written as a series of restrictions on government behavior. The government's allowed to do this, and the government's allowed to do that. And then the last couple of amendments, of early amendments in the Bill of Rights basically say, and nothing else. So if we didn't tell you you could do it, you can't do it. Now obviously that's been ignored by administrations and legislations for the last 200 years, but that was the original intent. So the idea of a separation of church and state, even from Thomas Jefferson's perspective, is about the fact that the church is to be completely protected from the state. There is a wall separating them. It was not meant primarily to be a protection of the state from the church. And so, yeah, of course the church has a role in influencing the government as individuals, as a voting bloc, as whatever, you pick it. As we talked about in one of our Q&As recently, that's part of our jobs is to vote our conscience. As a group, as individuals, as whatever, that's every single citizen's job is to vote their conscience. And nothing is supposed to protect the government from us voting our conscience, or speaking about, or writing about, or practicing, or gathering, or all the different things protected in the first few amendments, right? So that's true all the way around. That's our right, quote, as Americans, is to be able to live that out. So even though we are, as a Christian population, or as a church, the idea would be that, so our friend who is a member of our church, we're hoping to influence him. But as a politician, he doesn't get to have any official influence over us, right? He doesn't get to say, well, I'm a representative, so we're going to paint the church's walls this color, and I'm the representative. We would go like, I mean, that's sweet and everything, but no, that's not how we make decisions around here. But I'm a representative of the US government, and the church would say, I mean, and thank you, that's great. But that gives you no authority over the church. That was the idea from the beginning. Now the church has no official authority outside of everybody else either. The church doesn't get to come in. That was the, we don't establish a state church. There's not a, there's no, in a way, there's a Russian Orthodox church. There is not an American Orthodox church saying, hey, the government, you know, we're the ones who crown the president every year. That's not how that works. So that was intentional to separate those for sure. But of course we're supposed to influence it. But the phrase separation of church and state has been taken widely out of context to serve whatever purposes. Yeah, again, this is one of those wild things about politics, isn't it? That we all have to start a little jaded. It just feels like everybody uses whatever they want to use, whatever serves their purpose. And yeah, that's called politics, isn't it? Sometimes. So, and jumping into other terms then, transitioning from this, you know, we talk a lot, I mean, obviously we're going to talk a lot about specific things, but I would just want to start with when we talk about liberal and conservative, because we're probably going to talk about those ideologies, stances, whatever, as it comes up, because I'm sure as people are growing up in, you know, maybe a more conservative background, and then they see things from a different perspective. So I'm just thinking a lot about where we are located in East Texas. You're brought up in a certain way, surrounded by people who believe probably really similarly. And so, you know, what do you, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so then you're like, like anything, as you mature, you're then realizing, okay, I need to make my own decisions and see what I actually believe. And so I think it's important as we're going to be talking about that kind of liberal and conservative, what do we mean by that? And then kind of with that, what does it mean? Far right, far left. Yeah. Kind of thing. Those can be terms that we'll use. Which I think is really valuable. I mean, if also because liberal and conservative have been, I've, we've all heard them be used as weapons, like the words without have been the definitions have been broadened and they've been used to lump a whole thing together and then been used as weapons to describe someone who's not me. Yes. Or not my group. And I, yeah, I think it's really important to define that thing. And I think, I think we have, it's very common to hear liberal and conservative used across the board of like, when you say conservative, you mean religious, political, national, like every sense of the word is all yes, lumped together. And it creates so much confusion and even probably AIDS, I would imagine AIDS too with deconstruction because it's like, Oh, this, this all is the same. Like, okay. So yeah, I think it's important to define those. It makes it easy to reject the hole when you really only have to reject the part. Right. Yeah. And I think if you go all the way back to one of our very first episodes, we talked about the concept of cleaning out the underwear drawer. That's like when you, when you have to go through and the, your parents have bought your underwear your whole life. And then now you're, now you're moving into your college dorm or whatever. And it's time for you to figure out, okay, you know what? The Yoda underoos probably not a good choice anymore. Like I've kind of outgrown those. It's time to, I hope so. Yeah, exactly. And so, I mean, I, but yes, I get them for Christmas all the time, but the anything Star Wars, I can't hear more information than we need. Exactly. But the, but yeah, you have to pick and choose. And sometimes people's attitude, especially nowadays, it's just to oversimplify and not have a sophisticated way of it. And they just dump out the whole drawer. Like, I don't need any of these. And I mean, honestly, you probably need some underwear. So it's a like, okay, so let's, let's you evaluate them. Okay, do I keep this? Does this keep, does this go? And not only are people doing that sometimes with faith that they, and the more you attach to it, the more parts there are to reject, and you know, rejecting the whole thing. So, so two parts of this is if you are the person who that's your experience, hopefully this will be freeing to understand that it doesn't all have to be. And then if you're on the other side of it and you're the one lumping every possible definition of a term together, it could be just understanding that it could be hurting someone even in their faith. And in my opinion, it's hurting your faith and it is setting you up to deconstruct. And that's a, anytime you, you put Christianity, you stack your Christian faith, your devotion to Christ, if you put anything under it, if you set it on anything else, or even try to help support it with things like that, you're just asking for it to fall because it's apparently not what it's supposed to be. So that's, that's great. Okay. So let's discuss those. Yep. So why is it confusing when we use those terms, especially like in this world, in the Christian world or in the Bible study world or whatever? Yeah. Well, I, and I'm going to throw another one out there. Progressive. Yep. We'll get along. So I think, and, and Bryn, you can kind of address this as well. I think things are associated with opposition and maybe some negativity to where it's like, okay, liberal means we're not like they're not, people want bigger government, more control. This is leading us the wrong way. Conservative is like, okay, well it's not as basically using the word to define the word. That's what I'm trying not to do. Like limited, limited government set sounds really good. And so it's, I don't, I might just delete all this. I'm rambling. Bryn, do you have a coherent thought because I don't have a very coherent thought. I think just in my initial thought is when. By the way, I think you, I think that what you just did would be what almost everyone would do. Okay. Is that if they've not intentionally studied it, they're left with this, like, I have certain feelings about these words. Yes. Right. And I kind of think they mean, but, but yeah. It's like how this word makes me feel or what this word. Like the connotations with this. Or like what the, I even heard a podcast, there's so many podcasts that I feel like have touched on this, but I was listening to one the other day and they were trying to define it and still wrestling with well, some of it is, is what I associate with the word when I hear it. Funny. Yeah. Because the actual definition doesn't really define how we think about it anymore. Like it was very much of that. But I think my initial thought is the reason that it's harmful and the way that I've heard it used so much is, um, and maybe I just said this, but, um, we equate liberal with anything or conservative with, um, any group of political opinions and religious opinions. Okay. Good. And so when I like, depending on, you know, which side you find yourself on, which I even like, dislike the word side, but which direction you find yourself in. If I say the word conservative, I could mean some pol conservative political opinions. I could mean a group of people that hold to an opinion. I could mean morally conservative, meaning some different interpretations of scripture and those issues. And it's the same with liberal. And so, and I think depending on often when you are defining, if you're on one side or the other and you're defining the other side, it becomes more extreme. So if I am a liberal and I'm describing someone who's conservative, often I will ascribe, like assign the most dramatic opposition to my side as conservative. That's right. Instead of just going back to the actual definition of it. That's great. That's really good. So much of what we do when we talk in these terms, it is the, so when you're driving down the freeway, anyone going slower than you is somehow mentally handicapped. Like there's something like, what is wrong with you? Why are you going? And anyone going faster than you is a crazy maniac. And so that's how you engage with, and that's what people do with these terms is anyone who's more conservative than you is like, Oh, look at that old granny girl, having so slow in their left lane and anyone more liberal than you is a crazy, they're, they're blowing the whole thing. And it's a, it's a very relative concept. So the liberals and the conservatives and them and we run into it. It's humorous when we talk about it because I have, I have been called out. It's an easy label, but I've been called out online with even sometimes within the same thread as a raging liberal and a raging conservative because it's a relative. One person is writing and I'm more conservative than they are. So I'm, you know, I'm an alt-right fanatic or someone else who is, I mean, our discussion that we did on the role of women in ministry, understanding where our church stands is, is extremely conservative in most circles and is crazy liberal in other circles. And so there are people who would say, you guys are not following the Bible because you're not conservative enough. And I'm going to unpack what those words actually mean here in a second. So if I could just do it now. But that's an illustration of the relativity of it. Yes. And what adds to the confusion? And a healthy person is probably conservative in some ways and liberal in some ways and progressive in some ways. Now what you do is, of course you have to be, this is what's going to make this whole conversation. And always what makes podcasts like this hard is we've got to have a sophisticated conversation. And in today's world, that's difficult to have. And so to have a sophisticated conversation is not easy. You're supposed to assign a label and create a meme and you've made your point and move along. Right. And the minute we hear the word that we don't like, we see red and that's all we hear. That's all we got to know. All I got to know. So when we're unpacking these, so let's start with these three headings in a very basic sense, obviously whole classes on this in the government class, but conservative, the conservative viewpoint politically is the one that anchors itself in the tried and the true. So I'm going to try to present them all from their own perspective. Like this is how they would describe it. So conservatives would say, listen, traditions are there for a reason. They are stable. They're foundational. They are rock solid. They've worked in some cases for thousands of years. These are what create the stability for growth to happen. And if you start undermining, it's like if you start building the roof of your house out of the foundation materials, your house is going to fall down. So leave the foundation alone. Let it be stable. Trust in it and then build on it of new things, but don't usually don't tear down the old things in order to build the new things. Does that make sense? That's the conservative mindset. Traditional, it's anchored in experience. It's anchored in the past. It's anchored in the brilliance of the giants on whose shoulders we stand. That's the idea. Good? Good. Liberal, the liberal mindset is about personal freedoms. So personal, the best world comes from my individual freedoms and your individual freedoms. That's the focus. About the rights of every individual to experience life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and pursuit of happiness as defined by me. And no one gets to tell me that kind of stuff. This is about personal liberties. That's what that's about. And I shouldn't have to protect my own personal liberties, my own personal choice, my own personal freedom. So the reason government exists is to protect the freedoms of the individual. That's why governments exist. Conservatives would say the government exists to protect only fundamentals. The government exists to protect, so not surprisingly, typically conservatives look for a smaller government, and typically liberals look for a larger government because the government has a much bigger role in the liberal mind. It's got to protect each of our individual freedoms, expand them and grow them and protect them. Whereas conservatives would say, listen, you've got a job, do it, and then otherwise kind of stay out of it, right? We'll take care of ourselves. The third one that you mentioned is progressive. Progressive is also philosophy. Progressive, so each of these says, what is the role of government or what's the best life? Progressive, the progressive viewpoint is one that implements reform towards the best possible world. It's always about reform, taking what exists, making it better, taking what exists, tearing it apart, deconstructing it, and then reconstructing it into something better. And so you leave behind the past and you move towards something different in the future. So those are the basic principles of those three different words that are often politicized. They are political words, like they're philosophical words first, but they are applied to political philosophy. So then would you say it is even, I mean, at a minimum, unhelpful to use them when it comes to religion? Well yeah, that's what's interesting is- You know what I'm saying? Yes, oh yeah. How are they defined differently when we're talking about- About religious philosophy? Yes. So again, a religious conservative is one who's focused on the issues of the past, the tradition, what is tried and true. And so we would look at church fathers. What did the church fathers say? How did they interpret this? What does the raw fundamental of the scriptures say? Sometimes it's even how have we always interpreted this? And so what's been the same interpretation for a thousand years? Okay, so that's going to be the- what does everyone agree upon? What do the church fathers agree upon? What does the church authority agree on? What are the found fundamentals? A liberal, so again, we're talking religious philosophy right now. If we talk conservative biblical hermeneutics or liberal biblical hermeneutics, you can totally imagine the more liberal biblical hermeneutic is going to be answering the question, what does this mean to me? And the more conservative is going to be, what did this mean from the beginning? And so the hermeneutic that we taught in this podcast is largely a conservative biblical hermeneutic, which is what John meant when he wrote a passage matters more than what I think it means now. Right. Now- And that has nothing to do with- How I vote. Right, exactly. That has nothing to do with it. That is conservative or liberal, even progressive are just tags. They're a type of way of type of philosophical engagement. And so you apply it to political philosophy or religious philosophy or any other area of philosophy you're going to have in any area, any school of thought, let's say it that way. In any school of thought, you will have the more conservative and you will have the more liberal. If you've been watching The Chosen, recently they've begun to talk more and more about the two major schools of rabbis or the two major schools of the Sanhedrin at the time of Jesus. Those are, one is the conservative and one is the liberal. This is not new. This battle of who is more focused on the traditional and who is more focused on the liberal on the individual freedoms or even on progressive, meaning change for the sake of change, is a like, of course that's not new. Of course that's the Plato thought about it, Socrates thought about it. I mean, this is not new. It's an ancient conversation. And so now if we oversimplify it to only mean like there are conservatives, there are not. There is no one who is a conservative about every area of philosophy or school of thought. No one is. For example, Al Mohler the other day referenced, he's like, I'm not a progressive, but I love antibiotics and I love airplanes. And there was a day when the traditional conservative thought was if God meant us to fly, he would have given us wings. That would have been the conservative perspective. And so he's like, so when it comes to a flight, when it comes to air flight, I'm kind of a progressive. I want it better. And medication. I want it better, faster, more effective. Let's change it. Let's tear down the past and make something new. Like yeah, all of us are conservative in some ways, liberal in some ways, progressive in some ways. Of course we are. And so it's never going to be accurate to label someone and go, you're just, you're liberal about everything. I promise you they're not. Or whatever. So. But it makes sense looking at it kind of from the political lens that these perspectives would be at odds with each other. Absolutely. Because their end goal. The way to reach the end goal is very different. It's very different. What is the purpose of government? What is it supposed to provide? What's it supposed to accomplish? So just to make it easy on people to hear, right now in America, if you divide out the two parties, Republican and Democrat, stereotypically though not universally, Republican Party tends to be conservative, moving towards liberal, so conservative liberal-ish. And the Democrats tend to be liberal, progressive-ish. And so that's kind of where our parties are right now. And that expresses the disagreement. The conservative parties or the conservative side of the thing is more likely to say, let's stick to the original meaning of things. Let's go back to this. Let's look to family values, things that have been valued for a long, long time. And the more liberal, more progressive is going to say, no, we need to be focusing on personal rights, individual freedoms, and the government protect those. And that really does decide. I mean, when you look at our parties and when you see them fight about things, man, they're pretty close. It really is kind of how they, what they fight about. And what we're not saying is that if you are the party of political, the Republicans that tend to be politically conservative does not mean that they are religiously conservative. That's right. No, it's not the same. That's not interchangeable at all. That's right. That's right. In fact, Christianity is not the most conservative religion by any means. Right. Islam is way more conservative a religion, even though it came into existence 600 years later. Now, certain forms of Judaism are more conservative. You're saying you're meaning politically conservative. Or religious. Okay. As a religious, and so again, keep in mind within Christianity, there are more liberal and more conservative. Right. But if you divide, if you connect all the religions, which ones are more conservative or more liberal, it changes. It's different too. So again, it's just, it's the simplif, oversimplification of assigning a title. Oh, you're conservative. Yeah. And what that then is supposed to tell me is I can now predict everything you're going to say and do. Yeah. And it's just not, it's not accurate. And it's a mistake to link them. And you can be liberal in one, even within politics, you can have a more liberal perspective on one political plank, and a more conservative perspective on a different political plank. And that's allowed. In fact, I mean, that's in fact, every, I think kind of everyone probably does. Yeah. And so kind of switching gears to another term that I think would be valuable for us to talk about as we're bringing up this idea of kind of having a liberal bent or a conservative bent is the idea of hypocrisy. Yeah. And so we hear that word thrown out a lot, especially in deconstruction, having somebody, and this is not also, this is not the first time we've talked about hypocrisy. We've talked about it in previous episodes. Absolutely. But I know again in the future. But how, how do we need to understand this or what is, what is a way that we should be thinking about hypocrisy when it comes to this topic? Because hypocrisy is play acting. That's the literal definition. That's the literal definition. That's right. And so... It's a Greek word. Yes. That references masks. Yes. If I remember correctly, I was trying to look it up real quick. But someone who, and when we see the term hypocrite in the Bible, that's what we're seeing is someone who is attempting to intentionally delude others or who behaves in one way while verbalizing something different. And so it's a natural thing on Christianity because some in Christianity, Christianity actually offers one of the few solutions to hypocrisy, which we'll get to, but is when people have grown up being quote, preached at, you know, somebody says, sin, sin, this is sin, this is sin, this is sin, this is sin, this is sin. And then it turns out the person is doing those things. That's a, I had a friend who was an evangelist for teens. And I remember him standing up in front of a group of parents one time and he was holding his hands in such a way that he clearly had a martini glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other hand. And he's going, kids don't use drugs. And like that is hypocrisy. And when you speak, this is what's morally right. Ignore the fact that I'm using drugs right in front of you, that I'm taking an alcohol and help me out. Thank you, nicotine. And so that's hypocrisy. When you have a televangelist who creates a political party to get rid of pornography, and then it turns out later, he's been hiring prostitutes, that's hypocrisy. Now, why isn't that then the end of Christianity automatically? Because the main one is because we aren't hypocrites because we claim that we are messed up sinners. And so any Christian who claims that we've got it all together, we're morally right, we're perfect. Yeah, you are a hypocrite. Because I guarantee you, you're not. And you're hiding something or you're not hiding it well. So here's another thing that I feel like people might interpret as hypocrisy. And it is, well, this person, they say that they're a Christian, but they vote for Democrats. So how would, by the way, or the other way around, I've heard the exact, yes, you claim to be a Christian, but you don't care about. So here's a great one in today's. Yeah, exactly. You're pro-life, but you don't care about homeless kids. And the kids, once they're born at all. Right. Or you say black lives matter, but you should say all lives matter. Like that's a, well, if black lives matter, then I'd say hypocrisy to say only one ethnic group. So both sides sling mud, that's called, about hypocrisy all the time. Because Christians, we would say, yeah, well, I mean, welcome to humans. Right? Yes. Sometimes. Are we saying that that, like, is that a correct way of saying, like when we say, well, that's hypocritical. Is that actually hypocritical? It might be. Okay. It may be emphasis, like, like with the black lives matter slogan. I'm not supporting the movement or the website or anything, but the slogan does not say that all lives don't matter. It's just saying we're drawing attention to the fact that sometimes it doesn't seem like black lives matter the way they should. And so we're not saying that other lives don't matter. We're just, no, we're just trying to talk about this right now. The same thing would be true about, you know, if I get up and say, if somebody gets up and says they're pro-life, you know, we need to protect unborn children. Well, what about these other kids? Yeah, absolutely. Those two, we're just drawing attention right now to, that's not hypocrisy to say we're trying to care for one population. That doesn't mean we don't care about the other. We're just bringing attention to this one. Oh, you only care about foster kids, not adopted kids. No, we just don't have, we can't do both. We can't do everything all the time, right? So that's not, I don't think that's hypocrisy. It is hypocrisy though, if you actually don't care about, so if you say, here's one of my favorites, two populations that call each other hypocrites kind of constantly is people who are pro-capital punishment, but anti-abortion and vice versa. And so what is the, how do you deal with, so you believe in the sanctity of human life, but you also believe the government should be able to take away human life, that seems hypocritical to some. Or you say you want to protect children, but you don't want to get rid of guns. That seems hypocritical because a lot of children die from gun violence. So what I love is when people who just assume that, oh, you must be a hypocrite because, but the other side will say the same, you say you want to protect children, but you won't arm guards at the school. You're a hypocrite. There's always two sides to this. And so sometimes when you can get people together and realize, and the gun control one is one I've seen happen when you sit down and somebody says, oh, you're trying to protect kids just like I am. You just think there's a better way to do it. So this isn't a matter of you hate kids and I love kids, which would be hypocrisy. It is, no, no, we both love kids. We're both trying to take care of them. We just disagree on the best way to do it. Well, that's not hypocrisy. That's just disagreement. Like the humility to admit where you do agree. Yeah. Yeah. And so anyway, we would hope for that whenever possible, that that's part of the conversation. And I think it's even more damaging when you associate it with Christianity, when it's Christians having those conversations of saying, I'm painting hypocrisy on you because you don't see eye to eye politically on how to handle this situation with me. It's like you're not serving the Lord because you politically think this is the way to handle the situation. Yeah. Yeah. There's a an area of hypocrisy that I got called out on that I really appreciate it. And it changed my life, which was the claim that I wanted to change our nation, turn things around for our nation, you know, have a Christian great awakening, all this type of thing. And someone said, well, you realize if we fostered and adopted all the kids out of the foster and adoption system, we would then probably have the influence over the rest of our nation. We could shut down prisons. We could, you know, we could do make all kinds of massive changes. And it's not like we don't know how to do that. This is you don't need to wait and figure out how to do this. You can do this now. You can have a role in this. Well, when I got confronted on that by a speaker at a camp one time, not directly, he spoke to the whole group and then we met with him like, yeah, you're right. I either need to stop talking about this or I need to do what I can do about it. And so in our case, we fostered and adopted a couple of kids, which, you know, now I can't imagine my family without them, of course. But, but again, I would say, yeah, and I like passing that along like people who are going to say, oh, we're helpless. We can't change things, but you're not doing the things you could do to change. That's in America. The ultimate form of hypocrisy is complaining about the government and not voting. Right. That is hypocrisy. You're saying you care about this, but you actually don't care about this. And I think that's a totally appropriate, I mean, the Bible calls out hypocrisy kind of constantly and the recognition. So what makes a Christian, hopefully not a hypocrite is that I would say, yeah, I'm jacked up. I messed up and I knew I am. And I try to put these things in alignment, but I fail all the time. And so it's a great word, a vital word. And there are times when it is very appropriate to use it. You just can't assume you know other people's motives. Right. So that's what you have to uncover sometimes first. Okay. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.
