We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hello and welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner and you are about to listen to the second installment of the conversation that Chris has had with David C. Smalley. Now, if you're just now stepping into the series, haven't listened to anything on this, I would encourage you to start back with an atheist view part one, which will give you a good basis of where the conversation started before jumping in right into the middle of the content of this episode. So as we get started now, I want to encourage you to jot down some questions or just things that kind of came up for you as you were listening to the conversation. And in the next episode, we're going to spend some time with the Chris's unpacking key concepts that came up during their time with David. So without any further ado, here is an atheist view part two. So what he's in Isaiah, he's clearly describing I am I am the creator of all of this. I'm the source behind this kind of flexing that I'm every I do everything. Yes. So the calamity yet he is I think he is saying I'm the one who made I'm the one who brings peace. I'm the one who and I think actually, I mean, that would be a separate question, which I think is a it is a tough question to you and I spent it's been a long time, but I think we spent a long time talking about it is what we would call natural evil or natural suffering like tsunamis and earthquakes. And and that's probably what he's talking about there is I create calamity, big, big things like that. Let me let me challenge that because I think so if you if you go back to I believe it's Exodus nine through I think it goes into twelve but for sure eleven where you have the Pharaoh's people are held captive, right? The way the story goes is God goes to the Pharaoh and again, I'm going to get back to this because this is I think this is an example of God directly not only creating it but inciting our new favorite word and inciting evil to happen to innocent people. Okay, this is this is my evidence for this. When you look at Exodus nine, God goes to the Pharaoh. It's very important that it's the Pharaoh and it says he hardens the Pharaoh's heart so that he will not listen to Moses and Aaron, right? Specifically for the reason of him not listening. So then when Moses and Aaron go, hey, let our people go, the Pharaoh says no, why? Because God hardened his heart so that he would not listen. And then God in his wisdom in order to convince the Pharaoh to let the people go, he could have unhardened his heart just from a writer's perspective, right? But he doesn't. He kills the firstborn of every one in the village, every household in the village until the Pharaoh agrees to let the people go which was the whole point of the Passover. In order for God to pass over your home and not kill your firstborn, you needed to once again sacrifice a lamb and rub the blood on the post outside so that God would know you were one of the good ones. That's bizarre about God's knowledge, by the way. Just put that aside for a second. You wouldn't know that unless you killed a lamb. That's very strange. But imagine now that you are the father and you have a firstborn child that's 18 months old and that child starts to rather in pain and die because of why? What's the series of events that your child is now suffering in pain and dying in your hut somewhere in this village? You didn't know the plan. You weren't one of the, quote, chosen people. So you didn't know you had to go murder a lamb and rub its blood outside. So you're just inside with your kid dying, not knowing what's going on. And this is all part of God's plan to punish the Pharaoh by killing your child because of a Pharaoh's heart that he hardened so that he wouldn't listen to Moses and Aaron. It's like he's the arsonist and then he wants to be thanked for pulling you out the window of the last second. And it just sounds to me like God is stirring the pot and creating this very evil situation and then wanting credit for saving it. And the question I'm going to end with here and the question atheists have, or at least believers have that oftentimes turn us into atheists, is one, why didn't he just unharden the heart? And two, if you are the parent inside who is losing the child, or if you are the child itself going through that suffering, doesn't that feel like evil to you and who's causing it? So I think part of the answer, I don't know the order of the hardening, are you looking at it? Well, yeah. Because if you read what happens is Pharaoh does harden his heart. Yes. So God says he predicts in advance, when I send you Pharaoh's going to harden his heart. That's one. Then two, Pharaoh's heart becomes hard in 722. In the second plague, that's after the blood, after the second plague, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. In the third plague, Pharaoh's heart was hardened, was hard. The fourth one, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Fifth plague, Pharaoh's heart was hard. Sixth plague, the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. The seventh plague, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Eighth plague, God announces the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. Ninth plague, God hardened Pharaoh's heart. And tenth plague, God hardened Pharaoh's heart. So three out of three out of three out of the ten, you have God taking on a... And there's a few different things to it, in my opinion. And one of them is, there is again, the bugaboo, there is a contextual issue. There you go. So, and part of it does have to do with the Hebrew. And so, but for me, so there's a couple of different directions. And one is, even if all of Exodus should be tossed out, that would not undermine the claims of Christianity. And that's to me, that's vital to me. It's not necessary to me that if someone were to say, listen, this was a bad translation, or listen, these people just didn't, they were pre-modern, so they assigned everything to God. Like they didn't, the shock for them was a thought that Pharaoh could harden his own heart, not that God would harden his heart. It's a causational thing. Like, well, it happened. God must have done it, fate or God or something. Even if it was just contextual that from that perspective, that would be one. My perspective is which, and I know this is actually in many conversations, this is the step that is so hard, is the, which we talked about, and I don't know if you remember this, but we talked about me being raised by professors and being raised by professors. And I want you to get to your point. I know you've got one, an additional one to this specific thing in a second, but is that is, and I think we may have even talked about that. Have we talked about it on another? Surely we have on one of the reconstructed podcasts, but me being raised by professors so that I have a dad who knows more than anyone else in the world about anyone, but like two people in the whole world about bugs. Okay. He's a forestry professor. And remember trees. You talked about trees. That's right. Yeah. And so he's a forestry professor. And yet if I brought a bug to his office, he would send me down to Dr. Colhavy's office, who was the entomologist. I'm like, dad, I mean, Dr. Hoogan may be the only person in East Texas who was more about this than you. And he's like, right. So you need to go talk to him. And, and, and so I was raised around people who were experts. And so I'm always willing to let people be experts. It's a, it's a propensity when it comes to human motivation. It's one of the things that I'm, I am willing to let God be an expert on. When is the proper, the proper case for, okay, now's the time to let heart favor, harden his own heart. As I knew he would and said that he would, here's the proper time to maintain that hardening. And even here's the proper time to not force my will on him, which certainly he could have done. He could have forced his will and softened Pharaoh's heart. As you said, he could have forced his will on him and he could have just not hardened it. Well, it was, there wouldn't be forcing his will if he just didn't do it to begin with, which I mean, I think the passage is that Pharaoh's heart had hardened his own heart. But if God then hardened it, that meant it was softened by Pharaoh at some point on his own. Oh, I see. That's, and God could have just not intervened for the negativity, which was my entire point. Yeah. So this is, this is where it gets hard into the, into the Hebrew, which is the, the language is, yeah, that's what I was trying to look up because I haven't, obviously I wasn't prepared for the specific, for the specific point, but it does come to God calling Pharaoh to humble himself and he, and Pharaoh fights back. And the language is that it is a passive, see, that's what I got. I can't, I don't have time to look it up in detail. Maybe I can at another podcast look up it, but, but the implication is that the ambiguous language here is that it could also be translated that God is working against Pharaoh's hardened heart. And so it could, it could, that would literally be the opposite. It is. Well, that's part of it says it even gives the reason though, it says he hardened the heart of the Pharaoh so that he would not listen to Moses and Aaron. I believe it's Exodus nine, 12. I haven't looked at it in a long time, but if I have my phone here, I could, well, I'm looking at, here's the last one about the, before the death of the first born before Passover. And the language here says, and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart and he did not let the people go out of his land. Nine, 12. Chris, why don't I look it up? Why don't you go ahead and what were you going to say as well? Well, I was going to go back to the people putting the blood on the door. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. No, all I was going to say there, it's not that God didn't know, but what he constantly, you see all through scriptures, God asking people to demonstrate their faith in a tangible way. In other words, those, if you do believe, then it's going to be demonstrated through obedience. Okay. And so my view of that is not that he's going, Oh, okay. So he's a believer too. I had no idea. It's not like God is just now discovering that, you know, little Hebrew guy, it wasn't a believer. My view would be, this is God saying as an act of faith or an act of trust or a demonstration of that, you're going to believe what I say. Then you're going to put this on your door. So I wouldn't, I don't look at it and say like God had no idea who it was until they did that. It's more, I'm asking you to demonstrate your faith in doing this. And the Christian view would be, you're always saved by faith. It's always been demonstrated in action, but it's, it's going to be faith in what God has revealed. So in an apologetic discussion, the atheist would say, then why doesn't it say that? Because that sounds better if it's, I know which home you're in, but as a demonstration of faith, I want you to sacrifice this lamb and rip your blood outside. That sounds better. Like again, I think you're, you would be a better communicator than the author of that, of that, of that piece. But also purpose though, I think the purpose is certainly to tell the story. Certainly Chris would be a better communicator to a 22nd century American than the writer of Exodus would be. Yeah. I mean, there's no doubt about that. But this is all in the 21st. This is all pretty 20. Would this be 22nd century? Are we in the 22nd? I don't know how to do that. That confused me now. We're not, we're, we're still in 21, we're starting at 2100. Wouldn't that be the 22nd century? What century am I in? Oh, it doesn't know. It brought up some stuff. It was 20th century Fox. And now we're in the 21st century. All right. I think we're the 21st century. Right. Okay. By the way, I found it. It's Exodus seven three four. It says, but I will harden Pharaoh's heart. Uh, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt, he will not listen to you. Exodus say that we can seven, three through four. But I think there's another one in nine where it says it's like, it's not God talking. It's saying then God did did this. Right. So he would not listen to Moses and Aaron. Would you say, walker's looking that up? I'm going on the sidebar here. Sure. Cause you would kind of imply this earlier. Would you see a lot of the people that struggle or deconstruct their faith? A lot of it, they really do have tender hearts and they are bothered in a, not like an angry way against God, but it's more like that. That would be so sad if that's actually, you know what I'm saying? Cause the example you gave is the father who's, you know, child is dying. That that's a lot of the objections. It just doesn't absolutely. Most vast majority, and this is why it's so hurtful when Christians turn on their atheist family members, the vast majority of people can't speak for everyone. Cause I know atheists who are atheists for terrible reasons, but the vast majority of people who become atheist, it's a bit like turning against a father who is abusive. It's like, I love you. I want to be with you. I want to be close to you. I tried for years to be close to you, but you kept beating mom. You kept stealing, you kept hiding money under the blanket and drinking all of our grocery money away and making us eat out of dumpsters. You kept hitting us. You kept molesting us that, that level of torture. Eventually they go, I can't talk to that guy anymore. Even though he's my flesh and blood, and I know he exists. It's a breaking up with someone that you want to respect and admire. The vast majority of them start to deconstruct and they do it in this way that is very mournful. It's sad because not only do they lose what they thought was a guiding principle in their lives, but they lose their community. They lose the friends and people that are going to help paint the fence or meet up every Sunday and have the casserole and talk about the football game. The choirs, the plays, so many people are so just deeply involved with several aspects of the church that that is their community. Even when they don't believe they keep coming and when they finally stand up and go, I don't think this guy is real because I don't see how a loving God would do this to his creation and they walk away. It's like they're breaking up with everything in their life and it's so sad. To then be turned on by their Christian family members, it feels more like you guys are in a cult rather than you love us and we just disagree. So would you say you believe in any version of God? Is it just the Bible is more? You know what I'm saying? Or you landed on I'm a hardcore. There is literally no spiritual side of anything or just not the God of the Bible. I am still waiting on evidence to believe in the supernatural period. Anything that is not empirically proven. I think there's room to doubt and I think the closest I could come to having knowledge that I can't demonstrate is a dream. I could tell you had a dream last night about the comedy show that I did and I could tell you all the details that happened and you can go prove that that dream really happened. I can't but I know that it happened to me so I have my personal experience and that's where that should stop. The problem is Christianity goes that next level of saying not only did I have that dream if you don't believe it here are all the threats and here's how I'm going to manipulate the policies of our government and I'm not going to pay taxes because of my church however I'm going to have huge political influence and I'm not going to pay to play and I'm going to manipulate things so that you have to play according to my rules because you don't believe my dream and that's where the discussion needs to happen. I would never say you're under threat of duress for not believing my dream about my comedy show. Your belief becomes my business when you vote. Do you follow have you read much like the intelligent design like Stephen Meyer and God hypothesis and stuff? Oh yeah. I mean when you look at that you just go that's still not empirical enough. It's not. It's not and there's really no such thing as empirical enough. It's either it's either empirical right here we can touch it we can tap the table we know this is here versus theoretical hypothetical or theoretical in some way and so Vic Stinger wrote a book called God the failed hypothesis where he sort of debunks a lot of the things that you were talking about. It's the other side of that and he wrote God in the multiverse and talks about string theory and Lawrence Krauss wrote a universe from nothing and I did the voiceovers for these books. Many of these books when they went to audio. I don't believe I did a universe from nothing but I've done two Lawrence Krauss books one about physics and one about a fear of physics and then what about climate change and I've done like 36 of these audiobooks. I've produced them directed them or did the voiceover for them and so being in depth in that I see both sides because I the apologists would come on and pitch their book and then I would find an atheist who wrote the counter position and produce that audiobook so I have a good understanding of both. To me I think the next phase of this and probably I think the hardest for you guys to address is the problem of evil is certainly a big one but I think divine hiddenness is probably the biggest as as big as the problem of evil is and for those who don't know because this is this tends to be an apologetic you know listening group I guess right they're interested in having conversations with atheists so to maybe maybe so so to just to dissect the divine hiddenness argument it's if and many Christians ask me this so let me just save everyone all the time what would it take for you to believe right and I used to try to come up with something clever someone funny or someone smile or whatever and I would be like oh of God da da da da and Lawrence Krauss was asked that one time at a live talk I was at and he said if I walked outside and all of the stars were aligned that said dear Lawrence Krauss believe in me that would be a start and of course everyone laughed because he's like I could be high on acid who knows how I saw that right and and so my new answer I think is a lot more honest and clear when someone asks me what would it take for you to believe I say I don't know right but if there is something God should know it yeah God knows what it is God knows what it is right and if he's not doing it he's the only one in our relationship that knows both of us exist and he knows what it would take for me to acknowledge his existence so what's he waiting for I've got a podcast I've got thousands of listeners I have a following start with me move up to Sam Harris tap on Richard Dawkins I'll shoot him a text let him know you're coming right exactly like it could be done whatever it is that would convince Richard would convince Sam what would convince me what would convince Dan Dennett there's millions of us including Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie I mean you've got tons and tons of public atheists right that are that whatever it is God knows what would convince them what's he waiting for what's he waiting for he wouldn't be messing with my free will by doing whatever it takes to prove to me he exists because Lucifer is my evidence for this Lucifer knows God exists and shows against him anyway right so God could absolutely prove beyond a shadow of a doubt to me that he exists I could know he exists and still have the chance to turn my back on him so what's he waiting for why doesn't he why doesn't he do and I think divine hiddenness is probably I think is the hardest thing for apologists to address I don't you may disagree no I mean it would not be hard to address from a philosophical perspective but from an emotional perspective like what you said earlier about referencing the the family that's losing the child it would sure feel evil that's going to be that's a totally different conversation well it would feel evil and who would you who is in charge of that evil I guess would be right question you're when you're there and you're losing the child in that moment right when you if you go back up the flow chart ultimately God is the cause of it God is the one causing the child to die right right which so I would say one there's no evidence that causing a child to die is inherently evil that's not I mean I don't think you would apply that to abortion advocates that that every time they cause a child to die that's inherently evil well I don't call that a child so we would have a difference you don't call it a child I wouldn't call it a child not not at certain points I wouldn't interesting yeah that'd be an interesting conversation but but I don't think inherently causing a child to die is evil there are situations under which it would be morally appropriate to do so that even we could name much less if you were an eternal god rescuing a child forever and they're they're missing out on living a few decades in medieval Egypt well okay so our prehistory Egypt so and this is this is such a good I'm so glad you said that I'm a little disturbed but I understand um do you remember Andrea Yates she has but I don't remember why she uh killed her five children yes oh yeah yeah yes she drowned them she drowned five boys in her in her bathtub yes now she did it for the same reasons that Abraham was about to do that to Isaac it was to save him it was because she said that god told her that was the only way to save her children right because she was having she was obviously having mental illness issues right and was saying that uh the devil was going to get her kids as soon as they became the age of accountability right and so to save them and make sure they go straight to heaven without entering that age of accountability for the devil to get them she took them one by one and drowned them in the bathtub and then stacked them and then called the police right um because she had the mindset that killing a child isn't necessarily inherently evil it was there could be a good because that was a direct path to go to go to heaven right so that mindset that killing a child isn't necessarily evil I would say from a humanist perspective it is when that child is alive and is a human being which we can argue about the you know conception or whenever that thing becomes a person but she killed you know living breathing two three four and five year olds um but from your perspective that is that's a horrific evil okay so if we were to follow your worldview though and take god totally another picture how is anything evil like like on what stand it's just do you believe that's actually evil wrong should never happen or you just personally think that was something i disagree with yeah that's a great question so i am there's a growing number of non-believers who do identify with some objective moral truths and i'm one of them i think i think there are things that are objectively morally true regardless of the existence of a god or not but what would they be grounded in in other words what would you how could you actually say this is true for more than just me yeah that's a great question so it's it has to do with using just the facts of reality observable reality meaning if i pick up a lighter and i hold it to your skin there is no debate that that causes you harm even if you enjoy it it causes you harm right uh it causes damage to your skin and there is no benefit to the human being for that to happen it can cause an infection it can cause all sorts of other issues and if we keep doing it eventually you will die so there is a net negative to lighting your arm on fire that is non-negotiable there's no debate i'm not gonna have an argument as to why burning someone's arm off can be a good thing okay um that fact of reality means that that causes harm to the human and it does not provide a benefit to the human because getting a shot in your mouth is also causing harm to the human but if it's to deaden it so that you can have a tooth extracted then that's it's worth it because of the net benefit so if someone says i want to torture babies just for fun okay well you're wanting to cause pain to something without any real benefit it's the only benefit is your personal joy for getting for torturing something that's innocent that's horrific it's very clear but why why is that wrong because of the facts of reality that we know that torturing that child causes that pain okay but so like so like me me lighting fire to your arm even if it brings me joy is causing you harm but from your worldview though why is harming someone else wrong i feel like you're borrowing morals from my worldview that says no you shouldn't harm people like why is that wrong from an evolutionary we're no because because people were not harming one another before your worldview existed so it's impossible or not right they were they were and they were not so there were people who lived next door to each other that didn't beat each other to death before christianity was a thing okay it's in you've got so many years in china you've got so many years in egypt you've got people who were not like christianity was non-existent and there were people working together in communities communities were being built homes were being built families were thriving before your worldview existed so it would be impossible for that worldview to borrow from yours in fact it's much more likely the other way around is that christianity came along saw the good that already existed in humanity and started taking credit for that morality saying god did it when in fact it was already existing within people before your worldview existed but from an how would how would natural selection or survival of the fittest produce and ought like you ought to help your neighbor yeah i disagree with david hume on this okay i think you can do this um if you look because science can describe what happens it can't tell you it should have happened i understand have you heard of kin selection so kin selection is uh when you see a prairie dog for example there's probably 13 in their little colony and there's a couple of lookouts well the two lookouts are standing there perched up adorable by the way and they see a bird flying over a bird of prey they don't they could just easily climb in the hole and save themselves but it it's it's beneficial to the blood line and to all of evolution because they're all closely related and they pass on more of their own genetic material by yelling out and saving everyone even if they die and get eaten as the watch out or uh lookout okay so more of the genetic material gets passed on if they help the entire community so if they're if their community gets eaten and they survive fewer of their DNA particles get passed on so that's why we see what you would call morality in animals we see it in whales you know whales will save people from sharks they'll lift them out of the water we see dogs running into traffic to grab another dog by the collar who's broken its leg and pull it off the road because it understands that the cars are dangerous we see elephants mourning their own dead we see elephants lifting other elephants out of their ditches why would they do that why would an elephant who is is looking for resources looking for water looking for food help something that's going to compete with it it's because living in social groups is beneficial to intelligent mammals chimpanzees do the same thing bonobos do the same thing human beings do the same thing if we live close together and you are healthy and doing well i will do better and i can be healthy if you're sick and dying you're more likely to get me sick and cause me to die if you're living next door to me we can both lift this giant pallet of food into my home if i don't know anybody else or you're dead i have to drag this thing by myself so as a society we evolved compassion to help one another and we also developed mirror neurons i'm not i'm not from i'm not sure if you're familiar with the concept of mirror neurons but it's that concept when you see someone you know get kicked in the midsection and you cringe or you see someone put their hand on a stove burner and you cringe that's a mirror neuron going that might be happening to me your brain's not quite sure so you cringe in that brief moment you don't feel the pain in your body relaxes but there's that brief moment of people flinching you know when they see someone else get hit because of that mirror neuron so when i see you walking toward a door or i see you struggling or i see that you're hungry or i see you shivering it is in my dna and i have evolved compassion to care for my fellow mammals and put covering over you so that we can grow together as a society so there is an evolutionary reason for compassion and love and morality no god required because i read a a book oh my goodness this is in the 90s uh anyway in this book time time magazine did an article on this book i want to say roberts was in the guy's name anyways but the the title on time magazine was infidelity and maybe in our genes and uh what this guy did is he studied um i think it was silverback gorillas and he talked about the way they'll have a harem and fight off other competition because their goal would be to get as much as their dna into the next generation as they could right and so they want to have as many opportunities so they would have they would collect a harem i know what you're talking about okay i know what study you're talking so his point was this is why men are unfaithful in their marriages is because it's in us to want to just propagate um our seed as much as we can it's billions of sperm like it's ridiculous i mean it's way more than we would ever need yeah but with that line of reasoning couldn't i say so if i'm fit enough and strong enough and i want to overpower this woman and rape her because it's going to get more likely my genes passed on what in in evolutionary thinking would say you shouldn't do that because evolution is not just about survival of the fittest it often gets reduced to that but that's not what it is evolution is about adaptability cockroaches and raccoons have been around forever because of their adaptability but would you say it's wrong for the gorilla to fight off or even kill rivals so that they can have more females it's difficult when you start applying morality to animals but that's but that's what we are though we are but i'm saying when you but they're not in a civilized society with laws in congress okay so it is a little different and so when i try to apply my morality to a set of animals that are in the jungle it's a little difficult because uh they're they have a lack of understanding of it i'm a vegan but is it morally wrong for a cheetah to attack a gazelle i don't know i don't think so i mean that's how they eat in nature and there's no real concept of right and wrong to them on some on some level but there is this barbaric innate level of helping things like me so a cheetah may help another cheetah but not care at all about the gazelle because that's just food okay so when i point to animals to talk about morality i'm talking about how i care about you as another human being but we'll eat pigs no problem we'll i'll help you and buy you a dead pig to feed you bacon right so we we care about humanity as a whole not necessarily every living creature so the reason why it would still be wrong for you to rape someone even if you're powerful and strong enough to do it is because you're not adapting to your real surroundings your our evolution has to do with living in a society and you know what chimpanzees don't get away with rape they get kicked out of the troop if they are having unconsensual sex they get kicked out of the troop if they're stealing food and they have to live on their own they get ostracized from the group and they almost always die because there's nothing to warn them about the tiger there's nothing to help them find food and there's nothing to help them fight off an attack from another group so they are they are at risk and that's the punishment in bonobos and chimpanzees if you do break those rules if you grab a female and start to have sex with her and she doesn't want to you get kicked out so that's also a part of that you have to adapt to your surroundings and when there are rules in your society that's part of your adaptability and if you don't evolve to live in that society then you're gonna have to live on your own but you can but you would agree that you can still make your own rules if we talk about this the other day like if we're on a desert island it's always the illustration i don't know how we got in the desert island right but if we were to lord of the flies thing and just start our own civilization or whatever uh what what would you say okay foundation of rule number one that we've all got to agree on is going to be would you say don't harm each other it all depends on the it all depends on our situation if it's freezing cold outside there may be rules about warmth and you know whatever if it's really really hot there may be rules about but i think it would have more to do with you've got to think of other people what i think most most rules are typically about protecting people who have a hard time protecting themselves but wouldn't you say like that's the purpose of government is to like help those who who can't defend themselves like you don't just get to walk into my house the government has a law against that you don't just get to take my car we have laws against that well in our yeah in our government and other countries i mean people and i guess what i'm thinking of is history is this long story and i think this is what chris was saying earlier about deconstructing our faith in humanity history is this long story of people who don't care about other people it's so you have dictators yeah but you also have people living next door to each other that didn't make the news right who helped save lives all the time so we have both of those yeah so you can observe them but but by what standard would you say that society is better than that society like in other words if it's working if if owning slaves if owning people as property is working and they're not related to me they're not my kin they're different yeah ethnicity whatever they are related to you and that's the difference with evolution we do see them as related but so they they are and working for whom working for the people who own the slaves but not for the people who are so the mechanism by which to judge this situation will be john roll's veil of ignorance now take yourself out of that situation and unbiasedly don't make a judgment which one which one are you going to be you're behind a veil of ignorance you don't know if you're going to be the slave you don't know if you're going to be the master do should that situation exist and that's where the ought comes in it ought not exist if you can't thrive in both formats you can't thrive as a slave it's an easy way to wipe that out and that's not even subjective it is an objective moral truth because that veil of ignorance removes the subjectivity you take the slave owner and you say we're going to put you behind a veil of ignorance and put you back in the situation are you willing to roll the dice or should we get rid of slavery the answer is clear it's no longer about your opinion so again the bottom line i'm just trying to get down the bottom line for your morality is going to be does this harm other people it would be human flourishing versus not reducing harm okay yeah got it and honestly that what led me to atheism is i felt like religion harms humanity and i feel like god and and belief in god often harms humanity i i don't think as as as as disturbed as as andrea yates was i don't if no one had ever told her about god and a devil her delusions would have never gone there she would have never there would have never been anything for her to save her children from she might have still harmed them in some way we don't know but her entire basis of it was was the spiritual realm that she was taught as a child in a church that there was a god that there's good and evil there was a god and a good guy and a bad guy and in all of this she's in a mental facility now she's locked in a mental facility for doing exactly what people praise abraham for attempting to do and that's why we go if abraham were alive today he'd be in a mental facility he wouldn't be praised you're raised up as some prophet of god you know so and i think we're getting beyond that and more people are deconstructing out of that being more logical being more humane being more loving a lot of people a lot of young people start coming out of the faith and when i when they come on my show they go you know the first thing was my friend was gay i was 14 and it was a female and my my friend was his 14 year old female she told me she was gay and her parents were accepting and loving and i told my mom and she said they're going to hell and i'm going sarah my best friend in the world god is going to send her to hell i'd rather be with sarah than god right my friend trey crowder who's a comedian he goes by the liberal redneck on facebook stand-up comic he goes his uncle was gay this was his whole thing he was going to church every sunday his uncle was gay his uncle was going to the church they were going there what he would come over every sunday and watch football with his partner this was in the 80s and 90s and he said uh maybe early 90s he's a little bit younger than i am and he said uh one day his dad just told him the church said that you know your uncle can't come anymore you know we can't do that anymore so we're gonna have to either stop talking to him or go back to church you know because jesus doesn't approve of his relationship and and trey crowder and he does this in his stand-up he's really southern he's from tennessee he goes my uncle comes over every sunday to watch football i never even got an email from jesus you know and it's funny to a lot of people because he's like that that's that relationship i love my uncle to death he happens to be attracted to a man and they're over here every week that's where my relationship is that's where my loyalty is so they stop going to church right you know and i i hear from so many atheists that will tell me i was seven i was six i heard that my catholic friend was going to hell because we were johovas witnesses or i was catholic and my friend down the street was baptist and my mom told me they're going to hell and i'm like then i don't want to be a part of your church because i want to spend time with my friend before they go get tortured by your imaginary friend and that starts the wheels turning so that's what i say atheism believe it or not is often rooted in love love for humanity care for people and moving away from something that we see as harmful but the um and we talked about this years ago but it's it's intriguing to me that with all that in place you don't apply the john raul's rule to abortion we talked about that then like you don't know if you're the unborn person or if you're david smalley you get to pick now what do you believe about it you don't get to i would still do it and here's why i would still say it's okay because my life has not formed right and that woman's life has she has things she has a life she has health she has financial issues she has living conditions she has a whole world that she has built around herself and the fetus has not right even if i'm the fetus abort me if you can't take care of me abort me if you can't provide a life for me you don't want me who wants to be born into a family that doesn't want them abort me i do not want to exist if you don't want me thank you for joining
