We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, and alongside me in studio is Chris Legge. And today we are tackling a contradiction. We're doing our first one today in a methodical way, more methodical than just kind of a conversation. We're taking things that we can find online, people that have questions about it, and trying to just engage with whatever the statement is, or the apparent contradiction, or just the concept. And so today's is coming out of first John. So I'm going to kick it over to you, Chris, and then we'll go from there. Okay, so a different web page, the top 20 most damning Bible contradictions. I'm going to pick number one, and let's unpack it a little bit, because one, it does create or commit some of the errors that we talked about. And yet at the same time, and by the end, it actually brings up a contradiction that I think is fair and is worth analyzing. So I'm just going to read it. It's number one on their list, Christian sin, just like everyone else, or do they? So here's the content. Everyone knows that no human except Jesus lived a sinless life, the Bible says, indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins. Ecclesiastes 720. Okay, so let me let's stop there. We'll follow our guideline and actually see is that what Ecclesiastes, let's look and see if that's what Ecclesiastes 720 says. I don't doubt it, but let's do it though. It does it gets a good so I'm not sure what translation they're using the ESV says. Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins. So pretty good, right? That sounds like they were quoting it correctly, which is which at least that's good. Now again, they're quoting Ecclesiastes, which we've talked about before the book of Ecclesiastes is not meant to be taken this way. It's not that you can pull it's like proverbs are actually worse than proverbs because Ecclesiastes isn't even making the claim that everything in it has a kernel of truth in it. If this is some of the things in it are straight up not true. Intentionally, the author is writing things that aren't true at times. Because take for example, that the author is running an experiment to see is there anything of great value and purpose under the sun? So can you find value and purpose and meaning in life with things that you can just find here on earth money, power, politics, sex, education, civic improvements, collections, I mean the man tries everything and it's generally assumed to be Solomon is the one trying these things. And so he'll make certain statements like you die and that's it. Well, by the end, he does not claim that but on earth, when you die, that's it. Like if anything that you've made money on earth when you die, somebody else inherits it, you don't get to keep it. And so he will he make statements like that. So this is this is not quoting Ecclesiastes 720 is not a great way to start this conversation. It does not impress that Ecclesiastes makes us the author of Ecclesiastes makes a certain claim that doesn't mean that God would make the same claim in the same way. And in fact, God might say the opposite. So let's move on. They then cite Romans 3 23, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Okay, but there's no that is a phrase that you could take as a statement of truth. If you went back and looked in Romans, sure enough, that's actually one of the main principles of early on in Romans is that is that there are horrible sins that we all judge and we all like, Oh, yeah, you horrible sinners. But then Paul brings us to a point in Romans three, where he makes the point actually, everyone has sinned, everyone has fallen short of the glory of God. So that is a good that's a that's a good reference. It's that does apply to the question, do Christians sin like everybody else? And certainly Romans 323 would indicate that Christians that all Christians being human have sinned. Okay. Now, Romans 323 actually does not indicate that that the Christians sin all the time. That's not the idea. It's saying that all all humans sin and fall short of the glory of God. But I'll keep going. This is standard Christian dogma, but things get confused when you read the opening verse of Job, which says the job this man was blameless and upright. I'm going to skip ahead. We see another example of Noah who was blameless. Again, Genesis, neither Job nor Noah are being claimed to be sinless. That's not the same thing. That's an easy look past like clearly in the context because within their own passages, both Job and Noah sin. And so that's that to say that that's what's being claimed is that blameless here or righteous or upright means that they have literally never committed any sin and don't commit any sin. That's, that's an absurd abuse of that word or that terminology. I guess I can kind of understand how someone might read that and go, wow, these guys were perfect. I guess, but there's nothing in the passage to indicate that. It just means that they were living a righteous life. They were trying to follow God, which that's what righteousness is in the Bible. And then to reiterate what you were saying, there's nothing in the passage that would indicate that it's, or there are things that would indicate that they were sinful. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. You get, I mean, yeah, both sides of that. Yeah. Noah Noah gets out of the boat, plants a vineyard, makes some wine, gets stone drunk. Like, like it's a, it's an emmys. Yeah, he's got to get, but he's, he's apparently missing his alcohol fix while he's on the boat. So I don't think you can make any type of type claim that Noah is somehow blameless, meaning he doesn't ever sin. I think what that means is you can't bring a charge against him as far as being an immoral person. So I don't, again, I can understand why if someone decides the word blameless means sinless, that that would be a problem. There's nothing about this to imply that blameless means sinless. Okay. So the sinlessness goes a lot wider. He's the author says, because plot twist, ordinary Christians don't sin. Okay. Well, that's only gonna be interesting claim because Romans 3 23 says that all have sinned. But first John 5 18 says, according to this author, no one who was born of God sins, but he who was born of God keeps him and the evil one does not touch him. So he tells us to look over that's in first John, first John chapter five, verse 18, which is going to be what he says, we know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning. Now, there's a translational difference. That's interesting. But he who was born of God protects him and the evil one does not touch him. He also says we should check out first John 3 6. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning. No one who keeps on sinning has either seen him nor known him. Okay. And then three nine, no one is born of God makes a practice of sinning for God's seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. What was that reference? That was, those were both also first John 3 6 3 9. And then he'd started with 5 18. I don't know why he started with 5 18 3 6 3 9. Okay. So let's, let's read this, at least the paragraph from chapter three, since we've got a couple of references there. Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness sin as lawlessness. You know that he appeared in order to take away sin and in him, there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning. No one who keeps on sinning has either seen in or known him little children. Let no one deceive you ever practices righteousness as righteous as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning for God's seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. And then we get into the passage about our love for one another. So there's a lot of language here that's really interesting. The word practice shows up a whole lot and the word abide shows up a whole lot. So that might be worthwhile as we're, as we're digging through it. Let's jump back to his original 518. So I think this is really good. So here we have, we have this passage saying again to read 518, we know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects, but he who was born of God protects him and the evil one does not touch him. So we've got some interesting language here that we're wrestling with. One is this word born of God is, actually let me, let me come at this a slightly different direction. Let's go back one, two verses. Verse 16. So I'm going to read all the way through. If anyone sees his brother committing a sin, not leading to death, he shall ask and God will give him life to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I do not say that one should pray for that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. Now, one plausible option is that John in verse 18 forgot that in verse 16, he references a brother who sins, that he literally is referencing another believer who commits a sin. So it may be that between 16 and 18, he forgot that he just made the claim that there are believers who sin. And then in verse 18, because he had forgotten that, he then says, we know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning. It may be, in fact, we can go all the way back to the beginning of John, of 1 John, 1 John chapter 1, which is, you know, four whole chapters away, 1 John chapter 1, starting in verse 8. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. So one possibility is that within, I don't know why he jumped all the way to other passages, John in 1 John says that we sin. And if we say we don't sin, we're deceiving ourselves and making ourselves a liar and God a liar. He doesn't need Ecclesiastes or Romans. It says that right here in 1 John. And then four chapters later, he is saying Christians, people who know God don't keep sinning and people who keep sinning apparently don't know God. So it is possible that John just blew it, that John got excited and he was writing and he writes about the fact that yes, Christians sin and it's a lie to say that we don't sin. He forgot that he wrote that four chapters ago, or at least a few verses ago, because he then references the brother who sins. Or this isn't a contradiction. And there is another way to understand what John is saying. I am more than happy that if someone wants to make the claim, no, in chapter one, John claims that we all sin. And then in chapter three, he says we don't. And then in chapter five, he says we do. And then two verses later, he says we don't, because John is just muddled or insane or something. That's the claim you could make. But I feel like this takes us back to our conversation about man, the Cowboys killed the Giants. Or because the point I'm making is if I say the Cowboys killed the Giants in football last night, no one checks to find out what the death toll was, because you know the way I'm saying it, what I mean, you know, I don't mean that. So what does it mean? Well, here's one we noticed that in chapter one, he says that the work of Christ is what cleanses us from all unrighteousness. We have other teaching from the Apostle Paul in Romans 678 that talks about how there is I it is not me who sins anymore. It is the flesh in me that sins. It's not the new creation that I am anymore, that the new creation I am does not sin. Now, it's still me that sins, but it's not the real me as God intended, or what God has made new now. Maybe that's what John's talking about here. There's an aspect in which the real me doesn't sin. In fact, a common understanding of this is that he is saying so long as we are walking according to the truth of Christ in us, we don't sin. When we sin, what that means is we're not thinking about him. We're not knowing him. We're not experiencing him. Yeah, and it's us not walking in obedience. Right. And so that that would be like, listen, if you were living according to this truth, that you have been cleansed from all unrighteousness. So maybe it's a stance. There is a sense in which there is no more sin on me. I'm born again. I've been cleansed from all unrighteousness. There's no more sin on me. There is also a sense in which I keep sinning, and I'm lying if I say I don't. Both of those are true in two different ways. Now, someone might go like, yeah, now you sound like Obi-Wan Kenobi. Well, what I said was true from a certain point of view. And I get that. But the other option, either these two things don't mean the same thing at the same time, or I have to believe that John is just this bad. He's so bad at writing this stuff that literally over a period of five chapters, he can't keep his story straight. Do we sin or not? And it seems much more likely to me that he is meaning something in different ways when he says it. That seems like a more plausible interpretation than, no, John just is confused. And he's confusing himself. So one interesting one is that the word there for born is also the word for begotten. It may be that every time he talks about people born that don't sin, he means Jesus Christ. He doesn't mean us. He's talking about Jesus. There is no sin in the begotten one of God. I think that's a very plausible, especially when you understand that first John is a letter written to correct Gnostic thought. So Gnosticism was a twisting of Christianity that had risen about the same time of Christianity and integrated it in some ways. And it taught things like Jesus did not really exist as a human because humans are bad. And spirit is good. That's one of the teachings of Gnosticism. And so Jesus was not actually begotten. He was just kind of a created spirit. And much of John is John correcting Gnostic thought. Well, if you know that, maybe it makes total sense that he said that John is saying, no, no, he was begotten and he didn't sin. We are now born, we don't have to sin, even though we're physical. That would be a huge correction of Gnostic thought. I know that requires some extra work to find out that first John is a response to Gnostic thinking. Although most, it doesn't take a lot of work. You can find that with just a quick summary. So another one is that this passage is actually John saying, if you are born again, that is not a sin. And so that he again, correcting Gnostic thought to say people being born is bad. And that he's saying, no, being born again is not sinful. So he's literally saying you are not sinning when you are born again. That would be a fascinating way of engaging with this. Maybe because he had just referenced this idea of a sin unto death and a sin that is not unto death. What John really means is the believer, the one born of God, does not commit the sin that leads to death. Remember, he just said that all wrongdoing is sin, but there is a sin that does not lead to death. He just talked about this. If someone sees his brother committing a sin, not leading to death, he shall ask and God will give him life. We know that everyone who has not been born of God does not keep on sinning. It may be, and many people believe that what he's saying is do not keep on sinning the sin of death or the sin that leads to death. So what I want you to see is there's probably about seven plausible ways to interpret this passage. In six of them, there is no actual contradiction. In one of them, there is. The one requires me to believe that John blew it, that John just, man, he had some kind of brain moment and he can no longer remember that he's already claimed that we all do sin and be lying to say otherwise. Over and over. You know what I mean? And then he says later, oh, actually, no, we don't sin. And then he says later, no, we actually do sin. And then he says later, oh, we actually, and that I just, I don't find that convincing in this specific example, which is one of the better, I'll just tell you one of the better contradictions you can find in scripture are these sections of first John. And if that's convincing to you, then I would recommend you try to study the gospels without first John, because if that's the case, all you've managed to prove is that first John is not trustworthy. That doesn't mean any of the other scriptures are not trustworthy. So if you found evidence that the author of first John, potentially John the apostle, maybe you wouldn't think so if you think there's a contradiction here. So what I would say is if you if you're like, wow, I am totally convinced that that John is not trustworthy because he can't keep his story straight about whether we sin or not. Okay, I get it. I don't think you're right. I don't think that is the most plausible way to understand this. I think the most plausible way to understand this is he's talking about those who are living in the truth of being born again. Those people don't sin. When you forget that you're born again, when you're no longer living according to that, when you don't know that when you when you fall back into these old ways, like Paul talked about, I keep doing the things that I don't want to do. Therefore, it is no longer me who sins, not only me who lives, but Christ who lives in me, and it's no longer me who sins, but the flesh in me that sins. Now, those that's figurative language. And I think John is mirroring that here. I think that's by far the best interpretation because that interpretation works all the way through all five chapters. Yeah. I think that's most likely. It does not contradict Romans, tragically, based on our argument. It actually doesn't contradict Romans 3 23, which says that we have sinned, and this is about sinning, moving forward. But it would seem to contradict itself in 1 John, if the word sin here means the same thing all the time in every way. And I again, I understand the confusion. I understand the frustration with John. And 1 John, by the way, is accepted by pretty much all Bible scholars as one of the most difficult books to read. And part of that is because John is responding to a specific problem that we don't have. Right. And so you can imagine if someone had written a letter back then responding to the problems of capitalism, which didn't exist, or communism, which didn't exist, they'd be scratching their head going like, that makes no sense. What are you talking about? Yeah. Well, we kind of do the same thing with this. It's understandable that it's confusing. But again, what I'm left with is, I think it is more plausible that John is teaching a concept through using sin in different ways at different times. And so therefore it is not an actual contradiction, even though at the basic technical sense it seems to be, or at the basic literal sense it seems to be. So there's an example of one that someone threw out that I think, though the way they threw it out does not have great, I don't think they have a great case with what they're claiming. But they led us to one that I think is an authentic kind of fun one to engage with and to challenge through. And again, and then the final thing I would say about it is, and I think all of us would understand what it means, that there is a sense in which we don't sin, don't have to sin, shouldn't sin, etc. And then there is a sense in which if we claim we have not sinned, we're lying to ourselves. And so I think that's exactly the correct way to understand this. There's a sense in which both are true. Because of Christ's work in me, I don't sin. Well, there's a lot of sins I don't commit because of the work of Christ in me. There are still some sins, there are still sins that I commit, and I'm forgiven of and have been cleansed of the unrighteousness of. So again, fun to engage with, fun to talk about without trying to make it, without it having to be contradictory. I hope that makes sense out there. Does that seem confusing, Colton, as you're hearing it? No, no. And I feel like I'm just taking it in like a listener of like, okay, here's what the Bible says here, and let's unpack it. And I think that's one of the reasons why we want to do these little contradiction podcast snippets is to understand what are people asking, and how can we wrestle with this? And so if you're listening, and you've either dealt with this, or you know of other things, wrestle with it in a similar way. Read it. Seek out what the truth is, and then if you have more questions, reach out to us or reach out to somebody else you trust. But use this as a template if you don't have one. And I'm sure we'll come back to you with some more contradictory passages here, Chris. That's right. I look forward to it. Yeah. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
