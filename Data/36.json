We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. Alongside my partners in crime, Chris Sherritt, who's in Dallas, Chris Legg in studio, Bryn Starnes in studio. Hey guys, I'm going to throw it over to Brynn, who's got a question for us, which is going to lead into our conversation for today. Yeah, which this is perfect because we want to tackle these questions, but then this question perfectly leads back into our conversation about scripture, which we were hoping to do anyway, so it works out great. But the question from Kim that came in, she says, I wonder why God wouldn't have supernaturally protected the original biblical texts. It seems like it would have resolved a lot of disputes about the copies of copies of copies and scribal errors, et cetera. So great question. Yes, really good one. Any thoughts? Well, I think what we've been talking about is how it, what we do know about how it has been preserved. And so the overall message for sure has been preserved. We looked at all the reasons to trust the reliability of its transmission. So I don't, I think what we want is it would be great in a lot, I was just thinking in a lot of things, it would be way easier if God had, in my mind, if God had done some things differently. But God chose to do what God knew best. Like in my mind, I'm like, why didn't he just put Satan in hell right away? Right. That would save so much from or why doesn't God just leave these commandments floating up in the sky somewhere where we can all just look up and point to them? Like there's a ton of things where you'd be like, why didn't you do that? Like how come, you know, he didn't, I don't know, there's just like Chris said a few weeks ago, why didn't he mention iPhones? Because that would have been a direct sign that he knows what he's talking about. So part of it is I think that he did in one sense, maybe not to the satisfaction of we wouldn't have any problems then, but also there's a ton of stuff where in my perspective, I'm like, I think there's other ways, but that's what we got chose to do it. Yeah. Right. I think it's always, that's anytime we have a wide question, it's always good to say, because what we're, and I think we may have gone over this when we talked about the holiness of God at one point and the challenges of asking these type of questions when you're talking about God. And one of them is because he knows better. Like there's a quick answer. It's like, why? Well, because he's God and we're not. And so we should be asking why we think that's not a good idea, probably given that he's got at the same time, we're not minimizing. This is a good question. And so why questions we've said, we always want to come at them from, I just want to understand. And I think that's exactly what Kim is asking is I want to understand because man, it would be nice if this, and I totally get that. Now the actual way she asks it, why didn't he supernaturally protect the original biblical texts? Did you want to comment on that? Like you were talking, we were talking before about what didn't he protect them? Like what do you, what is that? Right. Well, my understanding is that he, I think the question is asking why didn't he protect the original copy of all of the texts? Like from a textual standpoint, why don't we have the original copy of each book in its perfect form without any scribal errors? But my understanding is that the important conversation is did he protect the message of scripture? And even I may be wrong, but it seems to me that having multiple copies that all throughout time have been preserved the way that they preserved is more a testament of God's power. Just because it's so it's not seen anywhere else in any other literature and anything else that's written. And so like we've talked about, even though there are copies of copies of copies, the fact that there's no, the message has not changed. And even the scribal errors that we do have are not significant to the message of the gospel. Right. That alone to me seems like he has been preserving the message now as to why he didn't preserve the original copy. Like you're saying, I don't, I don't know why he chose not to do that. But to me, it seems supernatural and even potentially more impressive from a standpoint of him showing his power of preserving his message that way. I don't know that. Right. I mean, and as things have come out, like we were talking about in the archaeology conversation, like even history proves that there is consistency. Right. Yeah. Brandon, you mentioned that when we had the archaeology episode, that was the one that was all weird in the, in the cutting of it. But the, you mentioned the Dead Sea Scrolls and how significant those were that we suddenly did a thousand year leap and were able to compare documents that were a thousand years older and you still had this radical level of continuity, not, not flawless continuity, but meaning based continuity. And that I think you could make a very good argument that that is God protecting supernaturally the message of his scripture for sure. And I do understand the heart behind this question of saying, wouldn't it have dispelled a lot of other questions and confusion if we just had the original everything and it's original copy, especially if God, if God can do anything, right? Right. That would have, I can see the comfort that that would have provided if he'd chosen to do that. It would be, it would be really interesting. So I'm curious, some of you guys have, I've been to Israel and, and you see the veneration that happens when, when there is a place like, okay, we've got, we've got a place that we think maybe this is where Jesus actually died on the cross. And so there's a giant building built on top of it, or this is the, this is where we think his tomb was. And now there's a giant building built on top of it. And in fact, it's such a degree that the tomb has been leveled. There now is no tomb. There's not even a hill there. It's just flat and it's paved. And there's a building allegedly on that, on that sacred, alleged sacred spot. And pilgrims come from around the world and a lot of them are like us interested in the history of it and the spiritual and the biblical connection. And a lot of people venerate those sites. I mean, they, they essentially worship those kind of the sacred space. So what, what do you think would be the effects of us having the original copy of Matthew of it still being in some papyrus in a perfect form? And, and one, would anyone buy it? I'm dubious. I think everyone would just not buy it. Like, no, it's not the original. You can't prove it's the original. I think it would be in a vault somewhere, either inaccessible to everybody, or it would be a place where people put their offerings. Like, I think people would be worshiping it and we don't worship the Bible. We don't, we don't worship the Bible. It is pen and ink. It is revealed truth, but the Bible itself has no supernatural power just in and of itself. It does not chase away evil spirits. They burn, it burns in house fires. Remember told you all about, I was told at one point that they don't, that the Bible can't be burned as a young person. I was told that like the Bible can't be burned. I won't tell you exactly what I did to check that. But I've, it's a fine way to how old were you when you were a teenager? Okay. I'm gonna back away and Chris get stuck. But again, the irony is we're, you know, we're so, again, we teach, we treat God's word with respect because of what it is, but we don't treat it with respect because of what it isn't. It isn't a magic tome. It isn't something that's going to protect your house because you have a copy of it. Like this, and if you own a copy and don't read it, it's not doing you any good. If you read it and don't apply it, it's doing you less good. Like it's, I think that would be the, one of the great dangers is if we had the originals in the original manuscripts originally written, that would imply something that I don't think God wanted implied, which is it's not these words. It's not this papyrus that is supernatural. It is the truth found in them that is supernatural. Now, again, I'm not saying, well, and that's why God did it because I don't know. I don't know why God did it, but I can imagine why humans would treat that. I think about how people treat the shroud of Turin and we don't even know for sure what this is. Like, is it a total hoax? Is it covering that was over Jesus? It's anything from an actual covering over Jesus to a complete hoax and people treat it as though they've walked into the room with Jesus himself when they see it. And that's wrong. It's a piece of cloth. And, and so we, that just shows you the human tendency to want to idolize even the good things God gives us. He gives us something good. So we turn it into an idol. I think that's exactly what we would do if we had those, especially if they were protected supernaturally. Yeah. And I think that's part of what, before Stephen was stoned to death, what he was trying to even say, like you guys have turned the temple into this idol where that's your identity and that's everything right there. And that's not what it's all about. And they, I think that was part of what he was trying to get at too. And keep in mind, apparently neither Matthew nor John, nor any of the others who, the disciples who wrote thought they needed to be protected. They wanted them copied and read and applied and given to more people and copied and read and applied and given to more people. There was never anything, apparently in the early church that sought to protect the original copies. They didn't see the original copies as supernatural. They saw the truth in it as supernatural. And what's wild is the truth in them has been protected throughout history. And I know that Bart Ehrman, I was listening to a debate between Bart Ehrman and Dan Wallace. And Bart keeps talking about, but what about the copies made before the oldest copy we have? And, and of course he's talking to complete silence. Well, and Dr. Wallace keeps saying like, Bart, we don't know. Like there, there, there could easily be some copies that existed before the copies we have, we assume so. What errors are made in those? Well, obviously we don't know because we don't have them, but we can see what's happened since and the line tracing the line backwards makes it very plausible. That makes it most likely that what we have is incredibly similar to what they wrote. And anyway, that was a, it's a, it's a great conversation. But even, even Dr. Ehrman has acknowledged that most of his history until recently, that what we have is largely the recreated new Testament. And I think that's a healthy conversation. Let's comment. In fact, going into textual analysis, please do. So another side thought that I had is knowing how we are as humans, I think even if we had the original copy, I don't know that that would have dispelled disputes about things because we tend to head out and have disputes over things. We would have just figured something else out. Yeah, regardless of how clear they are. And so I, I think, yeah, I don't think that that would guarantee a lack of dispute. No, we've talked about that miraculous things don't actually convince us as much as we think they're going to. Right. I'm trying to, what, I don't remember who, what professor was. We cited him in one, in one of our conversations where he talked about if God, it may have been a Dr. Krauss, Lawrence Krauss, but he said, if, if God went outside and God put a big lot thing in the sky saying, Dr., you know, Dr. Lawrence Krauss, I am, there is whatever. And then he, what's funny is he says, maybe that would do it. And then under his breath, he goes like, but I probably would explain that away too. Like, yeah, yes, you would. And so I, I think the idea here is we would say the message has been supernaturally protected. I don't know how else you can express and explain it being it getting here the way it does. And we're going to spend several, probably several podcasts talking about textual discussions and that stuff. And I think when people hear that, they'll, and we may even start that in a minute, but when people hear that, they'll be stunned at what the truth is and what the truth isn't and engaging in that conversation. But yeah, I think you're right. I think we would have still found things to dispute about. I just mean, given that, that we have two different old news channels, two different whole news directions that argue about what was said yesterday by somebody and it's recorded by 900 different people. And we're still debating over what the person said. And I think we would have found something to find about video evidence of things that we all disagree on. So what do you guys, what do you guys hear or know about the old textual analysis thing? Like what have you heard or learned over the years and what questions do you think are out there? And this is about how, how valid is the text that we have? How accurate that the goal of textual analysis is, is it's not to, it's not to discuss its accuracy from a truth perspective. It's to discuss its accuracy from how close is this to the original perspective? So what have you heard or what are the, what do you think people are wondering about with that? Well, I think we talked about this a little bit, but it's an example where people, I think, usually don't care to even listen. Like if you were to bring in her one of your Sunday mornings or say, Hey, we've got a Saturday seminar and this guy is going to explain to us all of the tiny little paper, you know, discoveries that we have, that this could be a piece of the, I think a lot of people, I think the only people that'd be really interested in going are usually going to be like people already interested in it. Like, right. Right. It's not going to be people. But then those same people, when they're told the Bible, you can't trust the Bible. It's been all this stuff. Then they're like, Oh my goodness. Is there anything this sort of helped me? So it's like, do you want to listen? Like, do you really want to hear this stuff? Cause it's really important stuff. It's kind of like when we talked before about, you know, me geeking out on biblical archeology review magazine. Like it's, have you already started your new subscription yet? I've just got to ask. Did you start a new subscription for it? No, not yet. I mean, those are my thoughts about that. It is important, but a lot of people don't think it's bad that important until their faith is all, I don't know. Yeah. And yeah. And so just to define what we mean by textual analysis, what do you mean by that? Chris like when you're like, yeah, that's, that is the, it is the, the, the conversation is essentially as Dan Wallace, Dr. Dan Wallace, who is, I think should be seen as the, maybe the world's expert on some of these questions. But I think he defines it correctly when he says it really is the conversation of, and it's not just about the Bible, by the way, any document, any ancient document, how close is this to the original? And that's where, how trustworthy is this as a representation of the original? And that's what we're trying to figure out. That's the main purpose of textual analysis. And so, and so what do we do when we find something textual criticism to compare the manuscripts in order, in an effort to reconstruct what the original texts said? I, I think on the, that same line, I think it is something that a lot of people don't take the time to dig into because they don't think that it's important, but then it is a tool that is used or a weapon, maybe too strong a word, but a argument that's used against Christianity a lot, even by people who don't have a significant knowledge of it. And so it's, it's just something that's flippantly thrown out that I've heard a lot of, well, you know, some claim about how do you even know, or, you know, and by people who aren't actually studying it. And so I think for that, it kind of goes back to the archeology conversation of whether or not you're personally interested in it. I think it does really support faith and Christian claims and is important for that purpose. Yes. And again, as Chris was saying, in fact, you know, our friend, Pike Weisner, who's a pastor here in town, he used to joke about the fact that his, his brother sold, I think electricity, you know, did that deal where they sell electricity and they give you a cut rate on your electricity, whatever. And he says, you would have someone to go like, Hey, what's your, what are you paying for your electricity right now? And they would go, I don't, I don't, I have no idea. When was the last time you looked at electricity bill? I've never, gosh, I don't think I've ever looked at my electricity bill. And then he said, so then he would sit down and go, what if I told you, I could save you 50% on your electricity bill. And all of a sudden the person has all these questions to ask like, Oh, well, but, but what about this? And what about this? And what about that? You didn't care about any of that until I brought it up. And that's what happens is when someone comes up and says, Oh, and it even starts with, I love that Dr. Airmen starts his with, we don't have copies. We don't have copies of copies. We don't even have copies of copies of copies. We probably don't have copies of copies of copies of copies. And so, and then Dan Wallace of course is like, and so you haven't made any claims yet. No one's disagreeing with that. We probably don't. We get, we don't know for sure that we don't have something closer, although we have no reason to think we have originals, but, but we may have some copies of copies or fragments, little tiny pieces, but they were written on something that decayed and went, and we're lucky to have anything. But the question then, so, so no one cares until someone throws that at them. Right. And then they panic. So let's, I'm like, throw a few numbers at you and then let's, let's have some fun with this. In the Greek new Testament, there's about 140,000 Greek words ish. And then here's the number that, that, that people want to throw. And that, so we'll start with it from this perspective. And according to some, Peter Drury is one of them. There are in the area in 140,000 Greek words of the copies we have of the Greek new Testament, ancient copies we have of the Greek new Testament. There's something in the area of half a million non-spelling variants between all the copies we have. Now, keep in mind a variance means any difference, any difference between any copies. So if, if you had a thousand copies and 999 of them have one thing and one of them has something different, that would count as a variant. Okay. So, so we talked about this before. What's the, uh, yeah, we're already, see, we're already losing you. That's a big yawn. I just sucked in here. See, this is hard. See, see this is anyway, not losing me, Chris. I promise. I'm just messing with you. And so this is a, so why are there so many variants is, is a, is an appropriate question. So what would you guess is the answer to the question? Why are there so many variants? Any news? God wanted to test our fate. Totally kidding. What, what it's actually what a Mormon, that's what a Mormon said to me when I showed him a different contradictions and that's what he said. Yeah. He's like, yes, God's testing our fate. Wow. That wouldn't be a blind faith response. Yeah. That is not a reasonable faith response. Well, go ahead. Chris, you got the answer. No. Well, I was gonna say, did you listen to, I mean, that was what, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a I mean, that was what a ruffled Laney's feather so much when we interviewed her and talking about, you know, her sitting under Bart Ehrman, because when you only hear that without any explanation, it really sounds terrible. Like that's more word, that's more variances than there are words in the new Testament. Right. Almost 10 times. Right. Five times. Yeah. It's very disconcerting. So, so the answer is yeah. Go ahead. Because we have so many ancient copies. And so we have in the Greek alone, handwritten Greek copies of the new Testament of sections of the new Testament, 5,500 manuscripts. Now when you compare that to other ancient Greek writings and an ancient Greek writing that has a whole lot of copies might have five to 10 copies. And that would be huge. Oh, not five to 10,000, just five to 10, five to 10. I think Plato's Republic is nine ish nine, 10, 12, maybe the Plato's Republic that we have ancient, what would be considered an ancient manuscript is nine or 10. So you have the Greek new Testament, just Greek, by the way, there's a list written in many other languages and copied in the new languages. The second century started to be copied into Latin. We have about 10,000 handwritten Latin copies between the Syriac and Coptic copies and other languages, another five to 10,000. So you're talking about handwritten manuscripts from the first few hundred years after the Bible was written. And we have somewhere depending on who you ask between 15 and 25,000 manuscript. So and then you're able to look at those and you compare all of them. And if one of them is different, that's a variance. Wow. Now, again, I've heard Chris say before, most of them are variances are spelling. Now there's half a million non-spelling variances, but of all the variances, a lot are spelling. Like what are what are what are you thinking? Well, word order. Let's go with that. Yeah, let's hear about that one. Like, well, Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus every single time. So it's not just, yeah, so every time there's indifference in any copy, it counts. So you get a multiple times when those two things are switched or if someone, if it says Amen and Amen, right? That I mean, all of those kinds of variants. And so the more you list those things, I think will be ends to happen if someone were to I mean, maybe you have all them there. I mean, some examples, but the more you do that, people go, oh, oh, like, well, then okay. You know what I mean? You start to realize like, okay, so you don't have reason to panic. The one thing I was going to add to what you said earlier, and it's not just how many we have, but how old they are because when it comes to I have for Plato, I have that we there's like a 1300 year time span from when he wrote, right? And the earliest copy that we have. Right. And so 1300 years is ridiculous for Tacitus is 1000 years for Aristotle 1400 years. These are 1000 years sober. It's not just the number that we have, but it's how old, how far removed they are. Right. First written. Yeah, we have ancient fragments within a within a hundred to two hundred years or maybe better. Okay, so there's there's that that's huge. So oh, you just closed your sorry. Brin's computer died. Oh, no, that's all right. You're still on. You're still on podcast though. Okay, good. Because I'm going to get you guys to look up a couple of passages so we can look at the really big scary variances. I'm I'm I'm really scared. Yeah. So and by the way, not including manuscripts, just the writings of the church fathers. So the second, third, fourth, fifth generation of Christians, they wrote and quoted scripture a lot. And there are over a million verses referenced in handwritten manuscripts by church fathers. Which also reconnects you. So these are people who may have some of them may have seen originals and they are quoting them and their quotes verify what we have. Wow. Again, so it's it's what this is called. Everyone, every speaker who talks about this for the Bible talks about quote an embarrassment of riches. The reason we have so many variances is because we have so much material. Right. And then so you can't just go back and be like, well, these other ancient manuscripts, they don't have as many variants. Well, yes, because they are only nine of them. As Dan Wallace points out, if we only had one, we would have no variance. Right. Exactly. So it's a weird world in which you actually so in the textual analysis world, a variance should not necessarily be considered bad news. A variance means you have more copies. Yeah. And some of the fun like Chris was representing. Oh my gosh, Chris was referencing the AMENs. That's always been my favorite is the is the AMENs because copyists people copying it will get excited about a passage and would put in an AMEN. Clearly that's what happened. They're copying a passage and they're like, this is just this is just good. Amen. And they'd write an AMEN in the next person who copied it copied in their AMEN and then they would get excited about different passage and they would write an AMEN to a different passage. And then everyone who copied after that. And so you actually can trace backwards how old the copy is by how few AMENs it has. Wow. And so they can trace back towards the originals because they have a lot less AMENs in them. Again, keep in mind every single one of those is a variance that counts as a very. So would that be a non spell? You keep saying that would be a non spelling. Very would be something like two AMENs. Yeah. And or like Chris said, the order of a word, Christ, Jesus or Jesus. Yes. Keep in mind that in the Greek and this is Dan Wallace is such a nerd on this stuff. Like he's forgotten more than I will ever know. But he talks about how many different ways there are to to write the phrase Jesus loves Paul in the Greek. There's like thousands of different ways to write that phrase. And they all mean Jesus loves Paul. And wow. And so they are the writers. Sometimes you will find a passage and they will. Every single one of them will say something like Jesus loves Paul, but they write it in several dozen different ways. And which changes the meaning none. Yes. Everyone counts as a variance. Wow. It's like Yoda and you saying the same sentence. We know that we hit on a lot of like there are a lot of little variants. But right now we just thought it would be valuable to hit the ones that have meaning. Is that some big ones? These are some big ones. OK. So changes to meaning, not just spelling, not just spelling or word order, but actual meaning. OK, so these are these are the big ones. By far, the biggest one is the end of Mark 16, Mark 16. So the Book of Mark, the oldest copies, this is a really great story. So in verse, the so the gospels, when they were written, they're written back to back in the old copies, the closest we have to the originals. You get Matthew and where Matthew ends the very next lines, Mark. So there's no gap. There's no title heading. There's no none of that kind of stuff. But it's what's we and that's true all through the New Testament when they compile them, except at the end of Mark, there's this gap in the oldest copies we have. There's a gap at the end of Mark. It ends in Mark 16, eight somewhere. I get Mark 16, nine through 20 was added. And no one knows why there was a gap. I had to write a paper on it. Seminary in my opinion that I tried to argue was that they had lost the end of the Book of Mark and knew they had lost it. I could have got damaged in a fire or got water damage or something. And they knew they had lost it. And so they left room in case they found an original copy, which I don't think is what happened. My personal opinion is somewhere along the way, someone filled in one of those gaps and it began to be copied. All modern Bibles will say the earliest manuscripts do not include 16, nine through 20. And with a part of why we say, I don't think it's original is because it references things that happen after Mark. And so it references the Great Commission. It references people being bitten by snakes and not dying, which I think is obviously a reference to the apostle Paul being bitten by a snake and not dying. Now the problem is I think later someone added this in because they were either trying to fill in the gap or trying to cover up for something or whatever, whatever their motivation was. But here's the deal. It almost certainly does not belong in the Bible. That's why there's a big in my Bible. It is a big, bold, capital letter thing. The earliest manuscripts do not include 16, nine through 20. Now here's what's wild because it's all taken from the rest of scripture. It's all quoting the other app passages. It doesn't actually change anything. The only change that it might make is if it's that when it says in verse 18, they will pick up serpents with their hands and if they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them is that someone says that somehow that's being encouraged. Oh, oh, well then I should go pick up snakes with my hand and drink deadly poison. Usually it doesn't have to. What's that? You didn't try that. Well, I have to as a teenager. I mean, yes, but not for religious reasons. And so there are churches that practice this, which is foolish and bad hermeneutics. But it would be a bad hermeneutic even if this was original. It's not saying so go do this as an act of some kind of worship. Go into all the world and handle and handle snake. Right. It's bad. But so this is by far, this is the biggest variance in the Bible in the New Testament, at least in the New Testament. The other big one is John 8, the story of the woman caught in adultery. And the issue with the story of the woman caught in adultery is that it appears in various places in the Bible in various copies, including like if I remember quickly in the book of Luke in one place it, but again, if you go to your modern Bible, the earliest manuscripts, big bold print do not include 753 through 811. Now that doesn't mean it's not a true story. It doesn't mean it didn't happen. We don't know. I, for example, as a pastor, I don't, when I teach through John, I reference it, but I don't teach on it because I'm not convinced it belongs there. I'm not convinced it is not a ridge. I'm convinced it's not original. That doesn't mean I'm convinced it's not true. I'm just convinced it's not original. Right. But again, we know this because of good textual analysis. So you guys have some other examples. Yeah. Brynn, you want to do yours? Sure. There's one in Mark 929 and it says, and he said to them, this kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer. He's talking about a demon. Yeah. And then there's a footnote that says this kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting. So it just adds and fasting. So it's the demon can't be driven out except for with prayer or maybe prayer and fasting. There you go. That's another big meaning. So that's one of the big ones. One of the big ones. Okay. Here's another one of the big ones. This is in Revelation 13. Revelation, excuse me. Revelation 1318 says, this calls for wisdom. Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 666. And then the footnote says some manuscripts say 616. Yeah. Dan, Dr. Wallace actually at one point I heard him say he was pretty convinced it was 616. But the most recent thing I've heard him say was now he's back to thinking maybe it was 666. So, and he's an expert on Revelation in particular. But I think it was Ben Stewart had heard someone say, well, the number of the beasts is 666 with the neighbor of the beast is 616. He was always mad at his neighbor because he was always, you know, messing things up in the yard. But again, the application here, not huge. Yeah. Except for the number. Yeah. You're tattooing the rock bands, maybe. Man. Okay. Bummer for some of those rock bands if they've got the wrong number of the beast, huh? Bummer. You hate when that happens. Yeah. Okay. Well, and Chris shared, you've got, you've got one. Yeah. So in John 15, um, where Jesus is talking about I'm the vine, you're the branches and all those things. At the end of that first section in verse 11, he says, these things I've spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full. And some copies say that my joy may be in you and that, uh, our joy may be full. Mm. Okay. So there you go. Okay. English spelling. If it was all in English, then it's just somebody dropped the Y and it was your. I wish I was enough of a Greek expert to know. I know sometimes that is that much of a, just a, a dot obviously can change the, uh, a letter. Wow. So why do you think, and this may be, I mean, this may be a bigger question for another episode, but why do you think people emphasize the differences so much in the text? The text, do you think it is primarily ignorance or do you think that like, what, what is the reason for that? Cause I feel like that's really common. It is. And I think it really throws people off. Um, I think, I think the issue here is that it sounds really scary and it freaks people out and it's, it literally is, you will see things that are hidden or protected. Um, I had to teach a class on hermeneutics and the textbook, one of the textbooks actually said that, you know, there's 15,000 ancient Greek manuscripts and it actually says in this book, and there are no differences between them. And I like, I had to read it like four or five times, like no, no, surely he's, and that was what this author not only claimed, but published and got it published. And that's just totally an error. And I think because people think, Oh, there would be, there should be no differences period. None at all. And then you find out, wait, there's half a million differences. Oh no. And they panic. And I don't think that's necessary at all. I think, I think it actually, we have such great material to work with that we can have, we actually can work our way towards the originals to such completion that we have no reason to think that we don't have. I think if we found an original, what we discover is absolutely no significant difference. And in the message and certainly in the message and not meaningful even in the text. And it's an intro, it's interesting. It kind of brings me back to what we talked about with Laney and Laney then kind of following up after the class or later on in the year with what Bart Ehrman actually, what, why, why he's actually an atheist. It didn't have to do with the variance. And so it's like, when you dig into it, it's like, Oh, this isn't it because for him, it was the problem of pain or problem of suffering or something like that. So, which probably just depends on the person's personal motivation. People may be just, you know, ignorant or not ignorant, but just unaware. Right. Exactly. And so, but to me, I'll go for it. Well, as you say, this goes back to what we've already said before about having a strong, strong man, see a biology that your view, if your view of God is that you will never allow anything bad to happen to me, you're going to be disappointed. And so this is an example there or what we just talked about on another podcast. If you, if your view is, um, no evolution in any form ever took place, right. And that's your doctrine. And then someone comes along and presents evidence that what's getting knocked down is not Christianity. It's right. Strong man view. And so it's the same thing here with what you just said, and Chris, whoever made that claim, if your view is there are no variance and that would prove that, you know, cause otherwise the Bible wouldn't be the word of God. It's like, well, that's a wrong, you got a wrong view and right. Should be deconstructed. Right. It goes back to our whole purpose here is right. When we've talked about how, when people say, yeah, I've deconstructed my belief in God. And we say, well, tell me about this God. Well, when they get done, you go, yeah, I don't believe in him either. Like I wouldn't, I wouldn't be interested in believing in the God who you've got. And if it means I have to believe that there are, if, if in order to be a Christian, I have to believe there's only right way to one right way to understand every passage. Well, then I guess I can't be a Christian or if I have to, it would be a Christian. I have to believe that the earth is a certain date. Well, then I can't be a Christian or if I have to believe that there are no errors in any copies of anything in the scripture, no, no transcript copies that have made it, that have no, no variances. Well, then I guess I can't be as good because those aren't right. And so what happens is we, we make those mistakes and then we blame God for our misunderstandings or our mistakes. And these are scary ones. I mean, the first time I read, you know, 150,000 Greek words, I don't know what that click is. And I don't know that is really weird. Um, the 150,000, you know, ish Greek, New Testament words and somewhere between 300,000 and a million variances. The first time I read that, I was like, Oh my gosh, what? And then, but then it'll digging. Oh, actually the variances help us trace them. The variances help us understand where they come from and what source they have and who wrote it and which copyists and, and work our way backwards towards the originals. It's it may not be what I would choose, but it certainly helps us work our way back that there are variances. So and even as we're called to disciple others and the next generation, I think things like this are really key. Even if we don't have a lot of knowledge of it, that we are teaching theology and scripture accurately because we are not, then we are opening up the next generation to have questions about, you know, like, you're just the example you just gave of, wait, I have to believe this isn't this to be Christian. And if we are not presenting this well to the next generation, then we're just opening them up for more confusion as well. So it's so true. Very good. Chris, anything else to add? I know a lot about textual analysis. Wow, I can't remember that word analysis as well. Anything to any of the toss in here as we're wrapping up? No, I think that it's just like when people make claims about contradictions in the Bible, it's like, okay, well, let's take it case by case. Like when you make these broad, generic, everybody knows that thing, like that's not helpful. Sometimes you're trying to just win an argument. That doesn't actually help you get to truth. So I think for a lot of young people or anybody, sorry, I should say, you need to be willing to be patient and to study a little bit and then let the evidence convince you, not your emotions and not some skeptic meant some tweet or meme. I think meme is the big one now. Oh, wow. Some meme freak you out. It's like, well, let's, let's look at it and be willing to. And I think for us who are convinced, we've said this before, to also be patient with the questions that other people have and to not freak out that they have questions or get frustrated. Like it's okay to have questions. Right. Yep. Very good. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.
