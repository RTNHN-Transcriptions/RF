We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. Alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes, both in studio. How are you guys doing today? Doing great. Good. It's fun to actually all be here. I know. I love it. I was almost not here. Spent the morning at the courthouse doing jury duty, but I was not one of the 90 picked for the jury selection. We were expecting you to record from the courthouse. I thought for a while, I was like, I'm probably going to be 90. I'm probably going to be 90. And when the 90th person was called, everyone clapped for her. And then the clerk was like, they'll turn on you in a second. You could have just recorded from the courthouse like it was a news podcast. There you go. Exactly. Can you excuse me, Judge Hurt, your honor? I'm recording right now. Exactly. Shh. Could you tell the attorneys to keep it down, please? Yes. Thank you, Bayla. While you're waiting, can I get your opinion on that? That actually would have been a good podcast. I didn't think about that. Okay. But guys, we're jumping back into the contradictions. And so I'm going to throw it over to Bryn. Bryn, why are we doing contradictions? And then what are we going to be talking about during this episode? Yeah, I'm excited to continue this conversation. So if this is the first podcast you've listened to since we've been doing this series, I just want to do a quick recap. A couple of episodes ago, we started doing common biblical contradictions and just going through a lot of contradictions that we find online or through prominent people who have said, hey, this is why I'm not a believer or one of the roadblocks that I have to Christianity. And it's just a really common thing for people to talk about of saying, oh, the Bible is full of contradictions. There are so many. It's therefore untrustworthy. It's essentially what they're saying. And so we've started going through some of those and just unpacking them because it's really helpful for our faith to not just know this general expression of like, oh, the Bible has lots of contradictions, but let's actually do the work to dig into some of them and even teach ourselves and learn how to, and hopefully help listeners learn how to unpack those things for themselves. So it's not intimidating when you hear, hey, the Bible has lots of contradictions and then just stop there and giving you guys tools to know how to unpack those. And so that's what we're doing. And we've been going through some of the more common ones today. We're excited. We're going to unpack some of the alleged contradictions from science and the Bible. And so this is a cool one because for a couple of reasons, and I'm curious to hear you guys' opinion, but one of the reasons I think this is important is because to me, it's something I've heard a lot is, well, Christianity and science are at odds and the Bible, and you have to either choose to believe the Bible or choose to believe science. And it's just presented as this false dichotomy. And it's something that I think a lot of people truly believe just unknowingly. And I've met a lot of people who either believe that or have believed that. And that was one of the, and I'm sure Chris, you have a couple of stories about this, but even in people that are close to me in my life, that's been something that has been really important for them to have to wrestle with. Does science contradict the Bible and vice versa? And so that's what we want to dig into today. And I think it'll be a really fun one. Some of these claims that people online or wherever are saying, you know, science contradicts the Bible or the Bible doesn't know what it's talking about when it comes to science and therefore shouldn't be trusted. Yeah. Well, let's unpack because we've talked about this way back. If you go back to our hermeneutics season as to what the Bible is. And I do think it's appropriate for people for us to acknowledge that the Bible is not, was not written as a science textbook. And the authors, the writers of the Bible did not understand even conceptually science the way we do. They didn't see scientific, I mean, the scientific method had not yet been developed. And our tendency, another episode that we did talking about moral issues was that our tendency is to say, well, we're superior because of our understanding. And, and the truth is, of course, we're always learning that what we believe scientifically is not perfectly accurate either. And I was watching a Veritas Serum, I think that's the name of it, podcast video thing this morning about the fact that what we believe about gravity is wrong. Well, that's news to me. I mean, I've been taught, I've been taught very clearly a certain way my entire life as a 50 year old. And now they're saying there is no such thing as gravitational force. That would be a big change, right? Yeah. And so understanding, of course, our understanding of the natural world is constantly growing and changing. And I think, and I think recognizing that and I get the pushback someone would give say like, well, but God should have it accurate. I mean, I got to have an accurate picture of it. They say that, but then they're evaluating the Bible and is what they would claim is maybe was God's opinion about something. I'm not as convinced of that, but it would be God's opinion about something scientific based on today's understanding. And we might discover, for example, in the future that it is, for example, scientifically, incredibly possible to make the sun stand still in the sky. That that may be a, in fact, if you've got any science fiction, if we've got any science fiction readers out there, if you've read the two body, the three body problem, I think it's called a three body problem. It's a science fiction book by a Chinese author. And he calls into question that there are 12 dimensions, for example. And that's theoretically, that's one of the things that's out there is it's not that we live in a four dimensional reality. We live in a 12 dimensional reality. Well, our brains can't even what I mean, okay. I'm having a hard time understanding the three. I mean, I barely passed geometry and so much less the fourth one. Then now you, okay, now you're making stuff up. So to go, it may be that if you say, well, but you know, the Bible says this happens and that's not scientifically possible. I would say you may be one that could be a miracle of some kind. God stepping into reality and changing the rules because he would have the capacity to do that. Or two, it's absolutely plausible. We just like the scientific understanding to do it. But I encourage people to research it because what we're about to discover is most of the things that people listed in the list, Brian, that you sent to us, the ones you had found are just not right. I mean, at the face level, that isn't what the Bible says. And so we're, even that's a tough one. Can I interrupt real quick? I guess I just want to make sure we're defining our terms. What do we mean when we say science in either way? Let's just quickly define what we mean by the scientific method. And then also when people are like, well, the Bible doesn't align with science. What do we think they're probably meaning when they say those? Go for it. You were homeschooled. Yeah. Therefore I know all the science. That's right. My understanding is that people mean whatever's recorded in scripture or stated as a fact, or even some people like you're saying, who are saying this happened in the Bible are saying that it doesn't line up with reality as we know it. When we look at nature around us or the laws of nature or the way that the world functions, that it doesn't accurately describe what happens. Okay. Is that, I think that's the critique, but the definition, I think the scientific method, what we're talking about is a, is a, a source of knowledge, empirical evidence or scientific knowledge is a source. One of the five that we talked about the five sources of knowledge, reason, reason, history or authority, intuition, revelation, and empirical evidence or scientific knowledge is the last one. And so this is going to be things that you can hypothesize about and then test it within the physical world. And so you were asking for the definition. Sorry. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Just saying my understanding what's happening. Go ahead. Oh yeah, absolutely. And so I think, I think that's the, that's what the scientific method is the process by which you test scientific knowledge or empirical evidence. So you make a hypothesis, you say, this is what, this is what I think is going to happen under these certain conditions. And so then you posit the opposite of that and you say, okay, then I'm going to test the opposite of that. And then you test it and you see what kind of results you come. Did your, was your hypothesis right? Or was your first assumption right? And so, or neither of the two, as often turns out to be the case in modern science, it's like, well, okay, no one, we all swung and missed at this one. None of us predicted correctly what was going to happen. And so that's a, I think understanding science is a methodology. It is a systematic study of the structure, the behavior, the details, the laws, the rules of the physical and natural world. That's what it is. And so, you know, you couldn't, you couldn't measure, you know, the mass of angels on the head of a pen because angels are spiritual things. They're not in the physical realm. And so there are certain things you can't test with science. And the way, and we talked about actually one of our examples of nonsensical statements was the scientific knowledge or empirical evidence is the only source of knowledge. And that's nonsensical because you can't scientifically prove that science, scientific knowledge is the only form of knowledge. You have to use reason and rationality and maybe authority and other things in order to prove that. So that's all we mean by science. But I think when people say the word science, exactly what Bryn is saying, they mean our, as we understand it today. Yeah. So as we understand it today, donkeys don't talk. Yeah. Oh yeah. Or it's like according to the science and the way that the world works, the observable reality that we live in, you can explain X or Y. Given, you know, we were talking about David and Goliath, right? You know, gosh, months and months ago now on a different podcast. And what we were saying was there, Malcolm Gladwell released a book. Oh yeah. And he was kind of talking about, well, this is why David was able to defeat Goliath. Here are my practical or scientific or medical reasons why this is actually true. And so I wonder, and that's kind of getting off on a tangent, but in a way of like, okay, now we're trying to read the Bible as a sign, like reading science into it. I don't know. I just wonder if there's levels of that as well. You know what I mean? Obviously it was not written to excuse miracles. Yes. Or just like whether it's right. I mean, I think there's levels to it. You know, you can, you can use it to say, well, that wasn't the power of God. That was a medical issue that this person was having. And so that doesn't, you know, that doesn't give you evidence for God or whatever. And then there's also the contradiction, which I think we're talking about more now, which is, oh, well, this cannot happen because of what we see is presented as scientific evidence today. Yeah, absolutely. But I also think your comment about the science, we've talked about this before too, but people also get into the habit of saying the science, like it's, it's, it is its own entity. That's right. Right. The science is like this whole and, and without defining it, that's right. So you just pit this ambiguous entity, the science against the Bible. And it's like, what are we even talking about? Yes. So as if it's its own, that's right. As if it's a, its own force within the universe is the science. So you have, you know, you have weaker force, stronger force, gravitational force, although apparently that's now up to debate and the science. And it's, that's, that is when you've becomes created something kind of called scientism and now it's a religion and you have, and you do see that you do see people. I actually had a discussion with someone who said, how do you know science won't eventually explain that? And I was like, Oh, I mean, I don't, but do you understand that's called blind faith? Right. Like when you're, when you're like, Hey, I believe so strongly in science that I believe someday it will solve all problems. Fair call that a religion and call it what it is, which is again, okay, fine. I mean, good luck with that. And I hope, I hope that, you know, that works, but that's, but I think when we look at these examples, call it what it is. And so, so when we look through these examples that you sent, so let's, let's look at some of these and the, and I agree with you. They show up time after time. Yeah. Well, and I think part of it's the thought that intelligent people believe in science and less intelligent people believe in religion. That's right. That's, but it's like a train of thought that even if people wouldn't come out and say that that's a common lie that is presented another reason. It is a very much so misconception. Right. There's not good. There's not great evidence for that. Okay. You want to go through the, yeah, pick, pick the pick whatever you've got, whatever order you want to go in them. Cause I, oh, actually we were going to comment on this. Yeah, go ahead. I'm going to be speaking a little more. Yeah. That's not because I'm the pastor or something like that. I literally had a martyr. That's right. I had some margin this last weekend to spend a couple of hours digging into these. This is research that I think almost anyone could do. Yeah. Any adult could do doubt. I think my only advantage is I have a better indicator of the trustworthy sources. Right. Okay. Then maybe, maybe everyone would. But that's because of practice. I mean, practice essentially. Right. I know which sources turn out to be more accurate than others for the most part, but yeah, this was mostly done through a series of commentaries, language critiques, that kind of stuff to find out what are the, what are these actually say? What are they not say? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So I, well, I compiled a list of some really fun science passages and we'll go through a couple of them, but let's just start with, this is kind of a funny one to me. So let's start with the earth being flat. Can we start there? Yes. Okay. Because we all know it is moving on. So we can pull up these verses, but yeah, there are a couple of verses, pull up these verses. This is really fun. I'll get the revelation one. Okay. The verses that we are about to read just so that the listener can follow along if you are not driving or doing something else. Exactly. That requires your attention. We are going to read revelation seven, one Jeremiah 16, 19 and Isaiah 11, 12, which are all verses that have been referenced by one group or another indicating that that the earth is flat in their opinion. And keep in mind that would be okay if this is just a historical book. There'd be no reason to complain about that. A lot of people thought the earth was flat back then, right? Oh yeah. Good thought. And so this is only a problem if this is inspired by the Holy Spirit. And if the Holy Spirit thinks the earth is flat, then either we have a problem that the Holy Spirit is ignorant or we are, the flat earthers are right. Right. Or we have a problem where the other, right? Yeah. Or it's that it wasn't inspired because it was written by a man. And at the time men thought that the earth was flat. That's right. And that's all you have. Right. Okay. So I'll read Isaiah 11, 12, which says he will raise a signal for the nations and will assemble the banished of Israel and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. That is literally it. And revelation seven, one says, after this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree. Jeremiah 1619. Let me see. Actually, I think I may have the verse wrong on this one. I think it's Jeremiah 1619. Because I, when he just says, this one seems more vague. Is it just from the ends of the earth? Yeah. When he says, to you, sha all the nations come from the ends of the earth. It's just the imagery that's indicating. Like the earth would have an end. Yeah. Has four corners and an end. Okay. Is not continuously circular. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the first thing I want you to do is if you hadn't already looked at those, what are you feeling? Are you like, man, that is some rock solid argument that the Bible thought that whoever, whoever inspired the Bible thought the earth was flat. Feel, feel a little going to call BS on. I'm just, that's how I feel. I'm just going to argue with how you feel now. So that's, so I go ahead. What were you going to say? Well, I was just going to say my first thought is I haven't even read these verses in context today. And it immediately seems like it's, it's imagery. It's creating a picture describing something. It's not that he's saying, here's some, here are some trustworthy facts about the earth. He's describing something else altogether. And when you also consider where they're coming from, there's like Isaiah tends to have a lot of imagery. Yeah. All prophetic. Yes. Literature. Yes. It is funny to me that she would go see, they think the earth is flat now that I mean, that's it. I, I, this guy, this is what I was talking about the other day. I had someone tell me that I was setting up a straw man. Like, Oh, you just picked some really terrible arguments and then showed how ridiculous they were in that last podcast. And I was like, I picked the top 10 off the first hit off the atheist website. Yeah. The main ones I pulled from the American humanists or something. So the first emotion is not what I'm pulling. That's exactly right. This is the first emotion is disappointment. Yeah. You're like, that's like, that's it. That's your whole argument. So let me have some fun with this. So do having done the research, I got to have a little, get to have a little fun researching whether or not the earth was flat. Exactly. Exactly right. I now know the answer. Um, the Hebrew word for corners means wings. It's the word for wings. It means extremity, the outliers. That's ironically, the translation corners is a Western thing, not a biblical thing. So the idiom is translated into English, the four corners of the world, because the four corners of the world is terminology that Westerners have used for a long time. Who should know better? Who, who know the earth is not flat. Yeah. Okay. So, and by the way, no one thinks the earth is square. Yeah. And this would imply not only that you think it's flat, but that it's square or at least rectangular or octagonal or at least four of the four right angles. So not even, nevermind. So the corners issue is actually an English idiom. It is in no way Hebrew. The Hebrew would have said the four wings of the earth. Now you may go, Oh, so the earth has wings. That's what you're saying. No. So clearly this is a word that means extremity. It means extremity, the outward edges. That's how it's used all through Hebrew scripture. The Jeremiah one is not that same word. This is the word that means the end where nothing starts. In other words, the edge. So the literally the ends of the earth and Jeremiah, you shall the nation, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth does not in any way apply, uh, an edge. It just means from all over from, from the edge as in, so there is a case to be made. And by the way, I have a, we can even put it in the show notes if we want to. Um, I have a, uh, a link for a research paper done on this. The best evidence is that what the Hebrews believed was very similar to what the Greeks then later believed, which was that the earth is a sphere, which again, except for some of our friends, that's what we pretty much all agree with and that it was surrounded with concentric spheres. There was a sphere where the moon was a sphere where the, and so it's like concentric spheres that have things in them. There was spheres around that and spheres around that and spheres around that. So Hebrews thought the earth was a sphere, a sphere, probably. Okay. Now we don't know for sure because they didn't leave behind a lot of scientific textbooks because they didn't have any scientific textbooks. Um, the, the, the, the will, will come just for fun. In fact, how about this? So I consider those absolutely, uh, worthless in the, to make the case that, that early, that, that the Hebrews or the author Hebrews or the Holy Spirit implied that the earth was flat. I also, the ones I'm about to give you, I don't think are super compelling that the, that the authors thought the world was a sphere. However, I can make just as good a case or better with these Bible verses. Ready? I think I need Isaiah 40 22. I got it. And then Colson, if you'll get Job 26 seven. Got it. All right. Let's hear Isaiah 40 22. It is he who sits above the circle of the earth and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them like a tent to dwell in. Okay. I would say that's at least as good an argument that Isaiah thought the earth was spherical or at least a circle as the argument, the opposite direction. Okay. Next is Job 26 seven. He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. There you go. So there's a, we are surrounded by a void and we hang in the midst of that. So these are, these are, yeah. So this is a, the, the, I don't, again, I don't those four passages are meant to argue science. I don't think any of those four passages are necessarily meant to explain this is, this is the nature of the world. I think they are giving a pictorial and, and, and, and idiomatic and imagery of something God is doing a poetic imagery. I think all four of them are. So I would also not argue those passages, the passages I listed to argue. However, I think the passages I listed are better. I think they make a stronger argument that they think that they, they thought of the earth as hanging in space as a giant ball than, than the other argument makes the argument that they thought it was a fat, a flat thing with corners. Now, let's look at the, yeah, I told you this would be fun. Let's look at the revelation one. Okay. Again, now this is the Western world. This is Greek. So remember the revelations written in Greek, literally the end of the earth in four directions. So here's what the Greeks knew. The Greeks knew there were four directions, what we call North, South, East, and West. There are four magnetic directions. The phrase that's used there means like four roads and the, and where they end. So, so the idea of the corner, it does mean corner in that it's something that a, that corners something else. So like that I'm trying now drawing with my hand, which is really good on a podcast, a North and South line, up and down line, and an East and West line, a sideways line, a vertical and a horizontal. They meet in the middle and therefore create four directions that are from four corners. So again, the revelation passage is not in any way implying that the earth has outward corners like a square does. It more is implying that the earth has an inward series of corners like a graph does, which is, we call those longitudes and latitudes. And so this is a, by the way, something else that's fun about this is the Greeks also use this idiom to mean something that has been hidden before, like in a corner. So like you throw, throw a piece of trash in the corner, so no one sees it. In fact, one of the great iron, I actually kind of chuckled at this is that apparently this was used anytime a secret was revealed meant you had come out of the corner and we have a different terminology for that in our country come out of the closet. But it's intriguing to me that that was the, and so the idea here is that God is going to call these spirits from where they have been hiding and now bring them together. Are these four wins from where they've been hiding in the corners, the four corners. So again, this makes absolutely no argument for the idea that it's, that it's flat. Yeah. Okay. And so let's look, let's look at another new Testament one, Luke 1734 through 36. You got that one, Bryn? Yeah. 17 what verse 34. I say I got it. And then I'm like, wait a minute. Is that right? 1734. That doesn't look right. And 3734 through 36. I don't know if that makes any sense at all now that I'm looking at it though. I wonder if I trans, transliterated that incorrectly. Is there anything in that that looks spherical? It's the passage where that the rapture, right? Yeah. He's talking about the rapture. Hmm. Oh, well, maybe, maybe it's not good. Scratch that one. That's what I get for not double checking it. That's right. Okay. There you go. We'll come back to it. That turns out to be, okay. Now someone, someone here is claiming one of the research articles I read claimed, uh, kind of claimed that Luke 1734 through 36 implies that Jesus knew the earth was spherical. I don't understand why that would argue that the earth was spherical. I mean, people get drawn up from it, but that doesn't, I'm not buying his argument. Yeah. Sorry. Not getting it. That's okay. Mr. What's his name? Who argued this? That in that night there will be two, then bed one will be taken and one left two women grinding one taken and the other left. Yeah. I don't see that at all. I don't know. Anyway, I'd have to read his argument, but I don't have time for it. This is why. Yeah, this is good though. Yeah, absolutely. So what I would say is the article that I referenced, which I don't, I'm not going to try to do the website. I'll send it to you and you put it in the show notes argues for that. What, um, what the Hebrew people probably believed about space. That's a really good, it's a really good research paper that if somebody is interested in that, they can check that out to see more details about that. Yeah, that's great. That's really interesting. Good. Um, great. And like you said earlier, a lot of these seem like they're obscure. Like we just pulled them out of, you know, nowhere, but a lot of them are from, yeah, like I, the, I pulled up the website that I was looking up a lot of these and one, one of the websites was the American humanist, um, organization, which is like a very recent website, you know, very well done. Um, yeah. Okay. You want to do another one? Yep. Let's do another one. Okay. Do you have a preference? I mean, I can just pick one of these. Okay. Um, let's do, let's do the sun standing still. Okay. It's from a story in Joshua and y'all jump over to Joshua chapter 10. And this one is an actual story. It's not just like prophecy or, yep. This is in a narrative, a historical narrative. Okay. How many verses of this do you want me to read? Well, the summary is that Joshua is fighting a battle and he's pursuing his enemies. And, uh, why don't you pick up, I think where the enemies kind of run into the woods or something and God starts sending hail after them. Okay. Verse 11. And as they fled before Israel while they were going down the ascent of Beth Horon, the Lord threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azika and they died. And there were more who died because the hailstones and the sons of Israel killed with the sword at that time. Verse 12, Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel. And he said in the sight of Israel, son, stand still at Gibeon and moon in the valley of Asia, Asia lawn. And the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. And there has been no day like it before since when the Lord heeded the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel. Okay. All right. I think that's about all the time. Okay. Again, what are your, when you read that, what do you think is happening? Okay. Just an observation. If you're reading the scripture, it is written differently than the rest of the passage. So it's written like a poem. That's right. Isn't that interesting? That is offset. It's like in the middle. Some of those words. Yes. But then it, then it seems to clarify it after that. It does seem to clarify that, that this actually was the experience. Yes. So Joshua asks God, he asks God to essentially still the son to give them more time. Now it sure does seem like, so there's a lot of ways to come at this one. It sure does seem like this feels like an idiom kind of language. Like, man, I wish the son would stand still. Like give us more, more time. I wish time would stop. You know, when you're hanging out with your loved one and the clock is running and you're like, I wish time would just stop or your kids about to go off to college. Y'all haven't anything like experience that yet, but I have. And you're like just makes time stop right now. And it is possible. In fact, it's probably super likely that that is one of the things that's, that's, that is a very real interpretation of this is that, is that Joshua is saying God stretched the time, like multiply our time, multiply our time. And then in fact, when you read it, it says that the son didn't hurry is the language again later. Like, okay. So it seemed like the day when minutes turned to hours, you know, time slowed. I actually think that's an extremely likely potential for this passage. Now that doesn't answer plenty of others, but because you still have hail stones falling out of the sky, killing people just. So I mean, it's still, there's a miracle going on here regardless. And you've got to be comfortable with miracles. Now let's, let's rescue all of you Christians out there who think that we can trace back the calendar of the earth and that we're missing 24 hours. I was wondering if you're going to bring it up. No, that is, that is not a thing. Don't don't do that. Like that is, that is, there's not a day missing from history. There would be no way to really test that if there was that, that is not a thing. Let that go. That's kind of, that's what old wives tale like, you know, that's, you know, and that's why men have one less rib than women, which, which we don't by the way, same number of ribs. And so that, that type of old wives tale version is offensive to the scientific understanding, obviously. So that's one, or it could be, because here's what's wild. The sun standing still in the sky. Now this is something we've talked about several times on the podcast. In fact, we talked about it, I think this episode, surely this episode will have come back before this will come out before this one, where we talk about the fig tree withering and that it seems like the two different passages you have in, in the two different gospels are very different. In one of them, the tree withers instantly. And the other one, the disciples are shocked that it's withered the next morning. And I said, I've never, my personal, I've never had a problem with the fact that different authors are writing from their perspectives, inspired by the Holy Spirit, but it still would include Matthew apparently didn't notice that the tree wilted instantly and Peter did, or vice versa. Right. And so one of them would write it the way they experienced it. The next morning, you know, Matthew shows up, is like, Oh my gosh, it wilted all the way. And whereas Peter was standing there a little longer while Matthew headed up the hill. And therefore Mark says it wilted immediately. So I have no, I have no, I get why some people would go well, but which one would the Holy Spirit say happened? And that would be difficulty. And I think it's that the Holy Spirit did not feel like that was a piece of information needed to be protected from people's experiences. I have no issue with that. I think what we see here is Joshua's perspective was that it stayed lit all day and all night. That for whatever reason, a light was provided in the sky for Joshua to continue fighting. So I think it either is an idiom, meaning it's the man we had, we had way more time than I thought we would have to kill bad guys. Or what happened was God provided a light all night. Now a God could of course handle all the ramifications of stopping the literally stopping the sun 93 million miles away in space, stopping the rotation of the earth, the spherical action of the, I mean, the, you know, the tilting on its axis, all the planets, the moving through space. I mean, if he's God, sure. He could do that. I don't think that's being demanded of this passage at all. I think this passage is either saying it stayed lit all night or it's just an idiom. Like, man, I thought we were going to run out of time way before we ran out of time. So, but then is that problematic if it's like re seemingly presenting a miracle and then explaining it as does that take away like a miraculous aspect of it? I don't think it has to. So two answers to that. One, yes, it may be this may. So the hail may be a miracle. Yeah. And the sun standing still isn't. Not everything that we would interpret as a miracle has to be a miracle, especially not when we use warfare kind of language, which we've talked about dramatic type of poetic language. And so that's, that's okay. It doesn't, that doesn't have to be, it's okay if a miracle is removed because we understand the language better. Now that's not, it doesn't mean there are not other doesn't mean there are another. In fact, like I was saying in this passage, there is a miracle happening, which is God is striking down their enemies with hail the whole time. And so I think, I think that's the case. So I think one of those two is the best explanation. One of them is clearly a miracle. There was a light source all night, but that's not that big a miracle. We can do that one. And so, you know, we can create light sources all night. The fact that God could have done that 3000 years ago is a little more, 3000 years ago. It shouldn't be, it shouldn't feel like, well, that's too big a leap, right? Or it was, this was a language they used. And especially the fact that it's introduced as a poetic form there is really intriguing. Yeah. It's like, it's a song they sung periodically. God, let the sun stand still so that we have more time to do your will. I mean, that would make a pretty good hymn now. Note that one, Colson. It even rhymed. Verse 14, I think I'm just curious. Yeah, that was my question. Go ahead. Yeah. Because there's been no day like it before since when the Lord heeded the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel. That doesn't necessitate like, well, then it has to have been that the sun technically stood still. Right. Those words don't indicate that. Like it could, there could have never been a day like that, that the Lord provided a light. Or is it? Is that what you're saying? That was my question. It does seem momentous. Like the phrases, the sentences after still seem like there was something worth marking about this day. Okay. So look at it. What's worth marking? The Lord heeded the voice of a man. There you go. What's cool about it? It's not that God fought for them. That's not unique. That happened all the time. What's unique is it wasn't God's idea. It was Joshua spoke to the Lord and called out to God, hey, God, sun stands still in the standstill of Gibeon moon in the valley of Agilon, meaning not here, but someplace else. And it did. So Joshua shouts out to God to make this, to do this thing. And God does it. That's what's so shocking. Yeah. Because yeah. So you think that shock isn't that not the fact that there was like something different about the sun happening. It's more that he listened to the voice of a man. Yes. I think that's absolutely, cause that's what it says when it's that he heated the voice. There has been no day like it nor since when the Lord heated the voice of a man. Cause God does fight for Israel. All the, I mean, he's done it before. He does it after he does it all around this. What's wild is Joshua in the midst of his panic and his concern, we're running out of time. We've got to defeat these bad guys, make the sun stand still in the sky. And it did. And hail stone fell out of the sky and defeated, killed more of the enemy than the Israelis could. And so that's what was shocking was that God heated the opinion of Joshua. That's what would have shocked people about this. I mean, they were, they'd seen God do plenty of miracles. Apparently it was shocking that God cared what Joshua wanted under these conditions, what Joshua called for. So anyway, that's a cool one. Yeah. And then I think we have to mention that it's the written in the book of Jay Shah, you know, just because it, I think if people are reading this, they'd be like, well, let's go look up the book and see what's written. And that's a good question. It's a book of the Apocrypha, right? Which has, I think has been lost. I am not. I did not look that up. I'm pretty sure it's a book that was like of the Apocrypha, but has not been canon. You just heard that sound. That was Colson passing out on the ground. Sorry, I just called you out. That's all right. Yes. But a book that has, I think has been lost. There's been like a lot of attempted forgeries. I can, I haven't done a deep dive on this, but but I thought it was worth noting. But how wild if it's something that allegedly was available to be referenced by the authors. Right. So it's like as a supporting document. Yeah, as a supporting document. So whatever actually happened, you know, it kind of reminds me of, we can't go back and reference it now, which is unfortunate. Right. Exactly. But whoever's, you know, reading this, it's, he's specifically saying like, Hey, you can also reference this. It's written kind of like, it reminds, it's a lesser thing, obviously, but it reminds me of the verse in the New Testament where it's where Jesus appeared to 500 people. And it says, who are still alive to this day? Like you can go and ask them that this happened. We're like, Oh my goodness, they're still alive. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Lord Elrond. But it, I don't know. I thought it was worth mentioning because we don't, I don't think we have a lot of information about the book of J. Shar. As far as I know, we have nothing that we have any confidence in. And it's referenced according to this Google search just three times. Okay. In the Bible. But it's still one of those things that it's, it's given, it's some, somehow presented as evidence to them, the reader at the time. I don't know. Okay. Yeah. Very good. That's another good one. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't, I don't think that's a deal breaker, by the way. If you're like, Hey, I might want to be a Christian except for that whole. Yeah. God's got the sun standing skill thing. I think it's too problematic. Yeah. I don't think it needs to be. Yeah. For sure. Okay. Yeah. Good. We would do another one or are we out of time for this one? I think we're out of time for this one, but that was awesome. If you have any science questions, hit us up and we'll see you in the next episode.
