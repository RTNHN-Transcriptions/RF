We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime Bryn Starnes, Chris Legg, and Chris Sherrod. Guys, I'm excited to be back in the studio. In my first trial of starting off, I said that what we were going to be talking about today is fun. And in actually thinking about that, it's not actually fun, but it is important. Some of the answers to the question, or our responses to the question, is scripture immoral by today's standards? So I'm looking forward to getting into those conversations. First thing, though, I want to throw it over to Chris Legg because you have, I mean, the whole purpose of this is to help people along their journey of deconstruction to hopefully reconstruct their faith on something solid. And so you were just talking to us about a conversation you had with a young man who is in the midst of deconstruction. And so would you mind just telling us a little bit about it? It was fascinating. One, it was encouraging because the reason the young man reached out to me was because his mother had listened to these podcasts. Cool. And so when she heard her college age son talking about his deconstruction or whatever, I guess, she said, you ought to reach out to the people on that podcast. And so he had reached out to me and we got a chance to talk. And it was intriguing to hear, just to hear his conversation as he, I mean, he just straight said where he goes to college or where he goes to university, that they require Bible classes, but the purpose of the Bible classes and the theology classes is to have the students deconstruct their faith in scripture, and at least in scripture, if not in God entirely. And so they, you know, there was a class where they had a PowerPoint when the professor showed them, you know, example, example, after example of places where the Bible contradicted itself allegedly. And the only one he could remember when we were talking was the death of Judas. And so at some point, you know, it's our strategy and our plan at some point to go through some of the most famous alleged contradictions in scripture and what that even means, what a contradiction in scripture, if there was one, what would that imply? What would that mean? And like, I mean, there's so many levels to have that conversation. Would it matter if there were two different versions of Judas's death that canceled each other out? Even if that was true, what would that mean for us? And so anyway, it's a, that's a, that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing. But is it true? Is it even accurate that there's two different versions of Judas's death or, and, and I know Chris and I have spent quite a bit of time on this topic. And we could probably come up with much better examples of things that are hard, much, much more difficult to explain than the death of Judas. And yet that was the example in this young men's, young man's mind. And that was the class. Didn't you have to draw it out of him? Yeah, even then it was really, it was, he had a hard time coming up with any of the examples the professor had thrown at him. And yet it had caused him to really question and doubt the basic faith that he went into school strongly, like committed to. So maybe it wasn't even the specifics. It was just the accumulation of all of it together. You essentially just quoted him. That's exactly right. It was the accumulation of all the little things. And again, just the fact that we want to make sure we're equipping our listeners and others to deal with all the small things and to carry all the big ones. Like it's not one or the other, but that's the, it's intriguing. The kind of a thousand little cuts is a hard way to go. Yeah. And what I think is really great too is like not only dealing with the little things, but also realizing that what we believe is not just, like it's reasonable. This is not just something that it's like, well, we just got to have more faith in it. Yeah. But I think also to realize the heaviness of it, that what you believe ultimately affects how you live your life. And so these aren't small little details that we should just accept. Like you said, for us, it's the small things too, because if someone ends up walking away from their faith, that's the trajectory of your life now that you're walking away from. It's going to affect your marriage or your morals. All these big things are going to be affected. So it is a big deal. And even I think a lot of times what small thing affects us is different per person. And so, you know, something that may seem small to someone else may be the thing that really gets to me. And, you know, and so that'll be different for all of us, which is why another reason we need community and need to ask questions of others and not just stay in our heads with that. And I think we learned, I mean, as Chris shared pointed out really well, you know, when we do hear something that throws us off, Chris has said a few times, just because it's new to you doesn't mean it's new. And you can't take things at face value. I mean, right. You know, I asked the young man if he had gone back and evaluated the actual arguments one by one and he really hadn't. And part of that was he had so many thrown at him that that's separating those out. I've almost laughed at like, you know, that you can download a list of all the 10,000 different contradictions in Scripture. I think there's like a Bible contradictions dot com or something. I think so. And it's got thousands upon thousands. But if you actually were to go through and look them up, which we joked about that being the future of our podcast is just doing three a week for the rest of our lives is that is that nine thousand nine hundred and fifty of them are absurd. They're not they're obviously not contradictions. And there's obvious solutions and answers to them that a preschooler could spot. And then there's a there's a few dozen of them that are authentically more challenging. And I mean, what does that say about our culture or maybe our church culture that we like a lot of people? I'm assuming who ascribe to, you know, I'm walking away from my faith, right? Are not taking a deliberate approach to ask hard questions. Well, I mean, we talked about this the last couple of weeks, I think. And some of this applies to our conversation that we're moving into today. But I think it's a number of things like we've talked about. Some of it is laziness on our part as Americans. We just want we don't want to put in the work. We want it to be just like fed to us. And and then some of it is, you know, ignorance of we've just heard a lot of things. And maybe we didn't have the tools previously or didn't know what the tools were that were at our disposal that we could dig in. And then I think there's also a level of, you know, deception also for people who want to malign the word of God, who are throwing these things at people for that reason. So I think I think it's there's a lot of different reasons for it. But something you mentioned, Bryn, I think is helpful is it would be interesting to ask him. So was your first thought was who can I who else can I talk to you about this? That's a great question. Like what community can I go to? Or I don't know where he went to church or whatever. But is there a group of people that I can go, wow, this is a I'm confused or did he feel the freedom or did he feel like you don't I mean like that's another thought there, which goes back to even what we've talked about with David Smalley's church. Apparently that he didn't feel the freedom at all. He felt the opposite where you're not free to ask questions or to be honest with your doubts. Or like you don't know where where to go to ask questions. If you don't have people in your life, then what resources? Because I know like a lot of Gen Z right now and teenagers, they know that they have unlimited access of information at their hands, but they distrust information more widely because they know how much false information there are and, you know, false information there is. And so I think that's part of it too is just probably an being overwhelmed of if you don't have a good community around you or good resources that you've been given, not even knowing where to go for a trustworthy resource to start research. You know, yeah, so true. And I know we said this before, but it is also always fair to ask how where where is your heart? Like, how much did you want this to be the case? You know what I'm saying? Like a lot of people, they want to live the way they want to live and their morality is what's driving their theology versus the other way around. I don't know. I'm just thinking not to not to say this young man was or whatever, but I'm saying I just wonder how many people are like, okay, this is this helps me. This confirms in my mind what I want to be true. Yeah. And so I'm not going to try very hard to remember what they really were. But yeah, yeah, I think that's a good point. And just checking it. I mean, I remember, yeah, Chris, how, how when David brought in the idea of, you know, the virtuous animals. Right. And, and that was new to you. And so you're like, that's fascinating. That's amazing. I need to go look that up. And you looked it up and like, Oh, yeah, that's not a thing. Animals are horrible. Yeah. And I don't think so. Like with a guy like David, I don't think David did that in bad. Like, I don't think David intended to be dishonest about that. Right. My guess is he heard it somewhere. And he didn't run the check. He didn't check it. But it fit with with the narrative. And so it was a great thing for him to bring to the table, too. And so it doesn't mean that somebody's motives are wrong. The professor's motives may not be wrong. That professor may authentically think these are really powerful contradictions and kids need to be set free of this, you know, whatever this fear of this fearful God. And so maybe their motives are sound. They're just not, they're just not solid on it. So anyway, I think for all of us, because I think we're all, we are all tempted by confirmation bias because of how the human brain is. And I think it's convicting to me to make sure that what I'm saying and believing I have thought through and have, am able to back it up because if some of my reasons or some of my facts are false or shallow, then that may end up impacting someone else just because I grabbed something because it fit with what I already wanted to believe. You know? Yeah. Yeah. I know. That's great. Well, Chris, thank you for unpacking that. Yeah, it's really cool. Thank you for sharing for that. And we're, I mean, I hope that young man gets, I mean, I would love for him to, I encouraged him to listen to the podcast and engage. I hope he hears this one and hears himself being talked about and, and has been encouraged and is willing to dig into these things deeply. So that's great. That's great. I'd be proud of that. Well, Brin, we're kind of switching gears on you. Yeah. Well, let's move into, back to our topic. Yeah. The main topic is scripture, immoral by today's standards. And we're going to start off kind of with the umbrella of sexism. Fun. Is there a reason we're asking Brin to take point on that? She is our token female. Obviously all sexist. And apparently we're not allowed, we're not allowed to speak about this. That's right. I'm the only one that can be an authority on this note. Thank you. No, I, yeah, I, I think I would love to start talking about the, be the first to start talking about this primarily from a standpoint of empathy, even just because I understand when it comes to conversations with other women or even feelings that I've had in the past. I think there are a lot of verses that when cherry picked, like we just talked about or taken out of context, do seem sexist or that the Bible is a presser. It features the truth. Yeah, I think it's a really important topic for that reason, just speaking as a woman. So, but yeah, so just kind of digging in and anybody can jump in and interrupt me if you have some thoughts, but because like we've said before, we truth is truth regardless of where you're, what perspective you're coming from. So, with that worldview, we believe that men and women can know truth about these things. So I think some of the verses just, and I'll just throw out a couple of the popular ones, but there are a lot of verses in the Old Testament that are offensive when it comes to like how to handle situations of rape or, you know, even in the New Testament when it comes to the most probably most quoted verses about women should be submissive and they should be quiet and they should be ordered not to speak and all of those things. I think those are some of the most popular verses that get thrown out frequently. And so the thing I wanted to start with is the bigger picture of the story of God. And we see like in Genesis, we see that God created men and women, both in his image, both sharing responsibility and mission. And then we see that even the word, which I love this, the Hebrew word helper when it says that Adam needed a helper. And we think of the word helper as like, Adam needed someone to do the dishes. It's like, no, but they needed a servant. Yeah, he knew the servant. But, and I'm, if this is incorrect, you can correct, you can let me know. But the word helper appears over 20 times in the Old Testament and it's mostly used when referring to God. To God, that's exactly right. That's right. Which, once you hear that, right. And once you hear that, it's in Psalm 3320, we wait and hope for the Lord for he is our help and our shield. And so even hearing that alone completely changes the way that you view even that of like God bringing Adam a helper. And it gives so much dignity and so much gives you the picture of how God intended it before sin was ever, ever entered the world. And so I love that God starts with that and the scripture starts with that. And then we know that sin affected all of our relationships and male and female relationships being one of them. So my understanding is that after Adam and Eve chose sin, then even their relationship, I think God gave them potentially different responsibilities before sin, but once sin entered, then the consequences of sin and how that affected their relationship to each other is what was directly affected. For sure. Okay, I want to go back further. Yeah, I got a question for you. All right. So further than, okay. Yeah. So this is one of the things that's fascinating to me is that the, okay, I'm going to ask it this way. One, those of you who don't know, Bryn, Bryn's tough. So when we brought, when I brought the Taser knives, which is a whole other story to our staff retreat, the only person who volunteered to go toe to toe with me with the Taser knives was Bryn. Well, can I tell the first time I ever met Bryn? Oh no, this is not story time about Bryn. This is good context. It's on brand. Bryn was weird. So at Pine Cove, you get a camp name, right? So somebody knew that she did Krav Maga and they're like, show us. And so she did it on her brother, which is really self defense. She did this move on her brother who, who y'all are, I mean, he's taller than you. Is he taller than you? Yeah, barely. He wasn't. Yeah. He, we were similar size at that time. It wasn't that you kind of flipped him over and then, and then Bryn said, I can't finish the move because I would have to kill him. I did not say that. You did. I'm pretty sure you said that. And then we were like, oh yeah. I was there that day. That's so obnoxious though that I said that. But that's the thing. Yeah, it's a comedy. You didn't say it in this like, oh, I can kill him. You were just kind of like, yeah, sorry guys. I can't show the end of the movie. I just can't do it. Bummer. So, so I want to clarify that first. So that being said, so there's, there's three of us guys who are on this. You are aware enough being a martial artist. If you had to go toe to toe with me or Chris Sherrod or Colson, and I don't know about Colson's training. What odds would you give you toe to toe? Fist, fist. All three of you at once. No, no, one at the time. Like just as a boxing match. Yeah. I mean, there, there's something to be said for like skill and speed, but it comes to purely strength. I mean, not good odds. Right. Yeah. Okay. So here's what I want you to hear. There's nothing natural about equality between sexes. Right. Nothing in the natural world. We don't see equality between sexes. There's nothing natural about that. So where do we even get the idea that there's some type of equality between the sexes that the sexes have equal value, that the sexes have equal principle, that the sexes have equal dignity. Where does that even come from? We don't see lions debating this or wolves debating this or spiders debating this. They don't discuss that. Where does the even the idea that the sexes should be equal come from? I mean, was, were cave people or was, were, were men and women equal? Do you think among cave people, was that an equality thing that they wrestled with was, I don't think so. I think probably the bigger, stronger men took advantage of this, the weaker women whenever they wanted to. That's probably how that, because that's how that works in the natural world. Sometimes the female animal is larger than the male animal. And usually you can figure out why that works out well. Right. But where does the, even the idea come from when you go to tribal places? Are they, is there equality between the sexes there? Is that something that they have struggled for and put in place? No. Nope. The root source of the idea that men and women are equal is probably the verse you just quoted in Genesis 1 27. I actually hadn't thought of that. There should be no such thing as equality between the sexes. So you can have a woman who has spent several years training to fight and still would have a hard time going toe to toe against a guy. It's just so you have a higher odds of surviving. That's right. That there's somehow, yeah. And again, that's different when you can catch a guy off guard and you know, who's trying to make a move on it. But it's not necessarily equaling the playing field. That's right. And so that's, that's not about fairness. And of course there are women who could probably take any of our heads off and, but then there are, but the, on the average, the, the concept of equality between sexes is not a natural idea. It's not something that Christianity or that Judaism came in and messed up, that the world was this equal place where men and women, males and females were equal. And then someone wrote Leviticus and like, well, well now that's gone. There was no such concept and should have probably been, and it wouldn't naturally be no such concept. I've read all the other world religion books and I don't remember there being a single reference to this at the same level as there is here in the very first chapter of the very first book, which is that men and women have the same dignity created in the image of God. So you have to give, you have to give Judeo-Christian ethic the credit for being the root source of even the idea that men and women should be equal. And that's where we need to start this conversation. Yeah, I would add if you read the writings of Charles Darwin, he was very much men are superior in every way than women. Interesting. Very sexist, very much. Yeah. Again, if you're a strict evolutionist, men have clearly evolved at the physical advantage over women. And so man's survival of the fittest, that's how that works, right? Anyway, you take Genesis 1.27 out and it gets ugly very quickly. Which is interesting that that's what Jesus went back to when he was challenged on divorce because in his time, a man could just, if he wanted to, he wanted to whim, decide, I'm going to divorce my boy. And Jesus talked about it's your hardness of heart. It's the sin in your heart. But he said, have you not read that at the beginning and he goes back and talks about how God made them male and female. And so you read the Genesis account and they're co-equal, they're co-leaders, they're co-working in the garden. They're equal in every role and every respect, but as far as dignity and equality and all before standing before God, they're equal. And I think the helper thing is because we already have our stereotypical idea of like, oh, I'm going to go in the garage and my little helper kid is going to come be my helper for the day. And we think it's like that way of thinking versus a whole other way to think of it is like, no, this is totally admitting that we need help. Like this is admitting like I need a helper. Like I can't do this on my own to accomplish all of what God's called me to. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I think you're right. I think, I mean, obviously there are individual passages that we can go and tackle if we have time. But I think that bigger picture of once, how the culture was treating women versus the commands of God and even the life of Jesus is what has been most helpful even to me of just seeing the bigger picture of, yeah, I mean, individually breaking down those verses that seem problematic. But when it comes to, okay, Adam and Eve, sinned in the garden and then all of life became broken because of that. And so from there you start to see polygamy grow and like the male oppression of women, men's oppression of women and all these different things. And so, and we've mentioned before in the podcast that just because things are listed in scripture or recorded doesn't mean that God is condoning them. And so there's a difference between things that God specifically says, this is my plan and things that are recorded. So like the fact that Solomon had an obscene amount of women, 700 wives and 300 concubines according to ridiculous. I mean, the man needs some therapy, let's be honest. But the fact that you never see God affirming his choice of that lifestyle. If anything, he's saying, yeah, all your lives, wives have led you away from me. In fact, you want to comment on that one? I think that's a good one to comment on real quick. I think it's Deuteronomy 17 and maybe Deuteronomy 14. Let me give you one second. Here he is. Laws concerning Israel's kings. God gave specific instructions to the kings of Israel. You can find them in Deuteronomy 17 starting in verse 14. Verse 16 starts with the list, must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt to acquire horses. Good. 17, he shall not acquire many wives for himself, lest his heart turn away, nor shall he acquire for himself successive silver and gold. Those three rules. So not only when the Bible references someone like Solomon having a bunch of wives or even David having several wives, understand the Bible has already made clear that that was an opposition to God's design for kings. And so you're exactly right. There are lots of passages that are descriptive. That doesn't mean they're proscriptive or prescriptive, either one. It's a description of what happened. Sometimes even those cases like in this one, by the way, when you go to the Samuel passages that list Solomon's, they're directly a copy from this. And then it says he had this many wives, he had this many horses, and he sent the people back to Egypt to get horses, and he had this much silver. And so it was clearly those passages are a condemnation of Solomon. God's already had given instructions to his kings. Don't have more than one wife. One is what I've designed for you. And then from the beginning, they ignored that instruction, and the nation struggled and suffered because of it. And the Bible is pretty open about all the problems that it caused. It's practically of recording how much strife, even Jacob, who had two, how many problems and division and all those things that it caused when they didn't follow God's plan. But I also love how the Old Testament... I definitely want to talk about Jesus's view of women, but even the Old Testament, there are many women who are listed as those that God specifically raised up for a purpose and to lead and to have an impact and to change the course of history, whether it's the commonly known ones like Deborah and Esther, or maybe lesser known like Miriam and Hoda, was that the prophetess? Hoda the prophetess? Who had gates named after her on the temple. Men was a prophetess among other prophets, but was chosen to... I forget which... I think it's Josiah, who's the one who got to explain to Josiah the new king what the law meant. Right. That was my sermon. Really? Today? Remember when I... When? When I preached with my life changing sermon guide. Don't you remember this one? No. When I was role playing, I was pretending to be the... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. ...serve guy. Oh, yes. I do remember that. Yeah, we got to go talk to Hoda. Oh, I'd forgotten to hold them being mentioned in that one. Yeah, or even like the Proverbs 31 woman who is listed as someone who does a lot of things that would seem inappropriate if the Bible was actually oppressing women. Like she had a business and she was, you know, these things. But... I always love... Proverbs 31 woman is such a great example because she's queen of her domain. Like she's got it going on. Like she is totally wise and confident in making decisions and it says her husband has full confidence in her. She's not like every decision saying, hey, do I have permission to do this? Like she's got it going on. Like she's strong and confident and hardworking and giving commands and providing like she's not this barefoot pregnant in the kitchen woman that is just waiting for her husband to get home to tell her what to do next. Like it's not at all like that. Yeah. And not... And yeah, there's nothing weak or inappropriate about her. Like she's... Right. And I love the fact that her husband is not... I mean, he is mostly referenced as like, and this works out really well for him. You know, that somehow he's lording it over her in the midst of this. He goes almost unmentioned in the passage. Her life is dependent on her relationship with God, not her relationship with her husband primarily. Oh yeah. She used to be praised. And it's the same word, the wife of noble character. It's the word noble that's used to describe David and Gideon and Boaz. Like it's a great... Boaz and Ruth. And Ruth. Yeah. Boaz and Ruth are the two people in that story who were given that same word. But I think when you read Proverbs 31, this is my opinion would be the reason that's not highlighted as much is because if you don't value the home, because you're not making all this income, which she is actually making some income. Yeah, she has run her own business. Yeah. But if you don't value the home or making a paycheck, because it's not the same thing that men are doing, then you're not going to see this passage as valuable. Which is so funny because the men weren't making a paycheck either, probably. They were working on their farm. Anyway, go ahead. G.K. Chesterton. So Chesterton, so this is an ancient quote, but here's what he says. He's talking about feminism and he says, it, feminism, is mixed up with a muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers, but slaves when they help their husbands. Wow. Isn't that good? That's painful. All of those amazing qualities there. I mean, this, this Proverbs 31 moment would be like employee of the year, you know what I mean? Or boss of the year if she had all those qualities, but it's if you don't value the home as the place where she's exuding those qualities, then it doesn't seem to be very valuable to you. Yeah, I think that's a great point because I think, I think it's helpful to say that if you don't have a biblical understanding of the family and the home and even when, and this is like a different conversation that is, is great, but we probably don't have time for today, just that what submission means specifically and how that works between men and women. But if you don't have an accurate view of that, then, then the Bible may be sexist to you because you don't understand, like you don't have the same values. You know, like if you think that, um, okay, go ahead, keep going. You're good. No, no, no. And maybe not sexist isn't the right word, but maybe offensive is the right word. Like if you don't have the biblical understanding of how under Christ, how beautiful some of this can be and how beautiful it's meant to be, then it will be offensive that it is celebrated that she was serving her family and getting up early to make them food. And you know, like there are a lot of those things that I think it is realistic to admit those are still offensive, um, to some people who don't agree with the biblical model. But I think the piece that you have to remember is the view that's presented is often not the biblical model. It's a distorted view. It's um, yeah. Hey there, Colson here. Just drop it in your ears to say if you enjoyed this episode, but maybe felt like the conversation wasn't quite finished, uh, one, you would be right. And two, not to worry. We will actually have part two of this conversation about sexism in the Bible out next week. This conversation ended up being longer than usual and we won't be out in studio on July 4th, which is a Monday, which is when we typically record. So it worked out great. Anyway, you can look forward to that. Thanks for listening and we are so grateful for you. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
