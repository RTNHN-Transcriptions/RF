We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. I'm joined by my co-hosts and partners in crime, Chris Sheridan and Chris Legge. It's like the old days. Oh, man. Well, similar. The band is like the OG. It's the OG, that's right. Exactly. And today we're reuniting. Obviously, Brent has got a sweet little baby boy who did not...Brent was really busy this past weekend and he was needing some mommy time. That's right. And so she wasn't able to make it, but I'm so glad that Chris Sheridan was available because, you know, we've talked a lot about different problems that people face with the idea of theism, believing in God, you know, or Christianity as well. We've talked about the problem of evil. We've talked about the problem of suffering. We've talked to a lot of those different things. I feel like one of those things, though, that is a substantial argument that people have is the problem of divine hiddenness. And we're going to unpack that in a little bit. And in my, just in my research, I came across something that I... So I want to kind of start with this, and then we kind of unpack this idea and what that means for us as believers. Is that cool? That'd be great. Okay, great. So this kind of highlights a writing by J.L. Schellenberg, but basically it claims that a loving God, or the problem of evil, or excuse me, the problem of divine hiddenness, my goodness, it claims that a loving God would ensure that there is no reasonable or inculpable non-belief in his existence, since this belief is required for human beings to enter into a relationship with God. And since according to theism, having such a relationship with creatures is a great good, and indeed is one of God's most important goals. But this author argues that since such non-belief occurs among those capable of belief in God, theism should be rejected. So that is an overarching thing. I mean, I know I'm oversimplifying, but anyway, that's kind of... So I guess throwing it over to you, Chris Sherrod, when you interact with somebody who talks about, well, if God really was good and loving, why is it so hard to find him? Why didn't he just make it easy for us? What are typical responses that you would give, or how would you kind of walk into that conversation? Yeah, so I heard this analogy recently, and I think it's a good one, because it does relate to me. We have now lived in Dallas a year and a half, and I think, I mean, honestly, as I've thought it through, I think I have only seen my mailman twice this whole time. And yet, the mail keeps showing up every day or every time there's something. I just opened my mailbox and there's something there. And so I think if the mail never showed up or other things like that, there'd be reasons for me to doubt, like, is there a mailman or if I'd never seen him? But I think I have to define what evidence would satisfy you, because it is easy to think. If I just saw God, or if I just saw a miracle, then I would believe. There is a quote that... This is from Matthew Henry way back in the day, where he said, the God of Israel, the Savior, is sometimes a God that hides himself, but never a God that absence himself, sometimes in the dark, but never at a distance. And so I think I would want to talk more about how do you define seeing God, and then like, what would satisfy you? Because if you think of what Pharaoh saw, or what Judas saw, or what the Pharisees saw, or even at the end of Matthew, when Jesus shows up and it's right before the ascension, and it says, and they worshiped him, but some still doubted. And you're like, wait, how are you doubting? He's like right there in front of you. So I think the question that I would ask is like, are you, what are you asking for? Because I've heard people say, unless you have 100% proof. And then I'm like, I think that that is not always the case, if people are honest, because Chris, wasn't it when we did our interview with, what's his name? David Smalley, where he even talked about, I think he was quoting Lawrence Krauss, who said like, but even if I saw it, I still might think I'm having a yeah, or something like that. Right, exactly. Yeah, I think that's a, the certainty conversation plays into this. You know, I'm some weird version, I think of a, I'm not a true skeptic in some ways, although in some ways, I think I am, because I don't believe in human certainty. It's not that I don't believe in certainty as a possibility, it's just that I don't believe in human certainty, because there's always a possible other explanation for anything I experience. And so it could be that we're just computer programs, as you know, Elon Musk has said in the past, I don't think that's super likely, but I agree that it's possible. And that the way the world seems to be the way it is, is because that's how it got programmed to be. Again, I'm not at all convinced by that argument, right, but, but it's, it's possible. I mean, it's not totally irrational. I could be, you know, it could be that I'm strapped down in, you know, the mental hospital somewhere, imagining all of this as a delusional schizophrenic, catatonic schizophrenic. Again, I don't think that's makes it makes much sense. I don't think that that works. However, it is possible, even though it's a tiny percentage. And so I think, I think that's one of the things that we have to be humble about and aware of is that, is that we, we can always come up, if we're looking for a reason to not believe something, we can always come up with that. What was, you know, Piaget taught about assimilation and accommodation. And sometimes I, I can't remember which of those is which. I think accommodation, let's see, assimilation, when we encounter something new and assimilation is when we counter some new piece of information and we make it fit what we already believe, if I remember correctly. And accommodation is when we change what we believe to fit with the new information. And one of Piaget's theories was that people, essentially human beings don't do the second one hardly ever, is that, is that we already have our opinion made. We're already certain of what it is and new information bumps into that. And it's like, you know, an iron vault that it can't get through. Now I, again, I'm not quite as much of a skeptic or, or whatever that would be a cynic, maybe even as Piaget is. However, I do agree that we can't know something with certainty. And if you want to explain away, I think we may have at some point, I told the story of, of my friend who was at a church. He came to the church year after year after year as a non-believer and said, I'm not going to be a believer until I see a miracle. And then there was a medical miracle, a girl who had a certain sickness. She came before the church that had the gelders laid hand on her and prayed over her. And she went back to the hospital and the illness was gone. So it was there. And then it was, then it was gone. And then he said like, yeah, I don't, I still don't believe, I just don't believe it. Like, okay. So at least you're honest enough to say, you, you were, there was a certain type of miracle you wanted to see that it played out exactly a certain way that you wanted to see it. And so I agree with you. I think one of the things when I'm talking with someone who has that issue, I'm always asking them, what, what do you think would convince you and would it actually convince you? So I agree. I think that's a, that's certainly part of the conversation as well that can you be convinced? Would there be possibly enough information to do it? So that's, I agree. I think that's one big area is a certainty conversation. Yep. The other thought that came to my mind was in Luke 16, when Jesus tells the story of the rich man in Lazarus, which is maybe a parable. It never says that it's actually a made up story, but it doesn't sound like anyways, but the point is at the end, the rich man is talking to Abraham about, you know, can I, can I be rescued from this? He's like, no, there's this chasm between us. And then he says, well, can you, I've got five brothers. Can you go back and send Lazarus back to them? And Abram says, no, they've got Moses and the prophets. So in other words, they've got the old Testament law and stuff. And he says, no. And now I'm reading in verse 30 and he said, no, father, Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. And he said to them, if they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead, which again, I think is the same thing where when Jesus comes back to life and there's still people who are doubting, you're like, how, what's going on? But so I think part of my response in this is I, I rehearse in my mind, okay, what are the reasons why I believe? So why do I believe that there's a God, even if I didn't see him looking at design or complexity of life or reliability of scripture and things like that. But I also think, like we've done many times before, you've got to redefine faith for people that, um, I recently heard a real good way to put it that the world would say faith is belief in spite of the evidence. And we would say belief, faith is belief in light of the evidence. Yeah. Um, I liked that little wording right there. Um, you know, me, I just, you have, I know those are, I have to like, it just catches on. But since we've been talking about deconstructing some things, I think that there, there does need to be some deconstructing of people's expectations of what God is supposed to do. Like, is God obligated to answer verbally or audibly or, uh, audibly, or is he obligated to speak to you? Know what I'm saying? Like, I think some people do have disappointments with God's apparent hiddenness because he didn't answer the way that they wanted, but it's because they've been expecting God to act in a certain way. Does that make sense? They're thinking this is how God is supposed to respond the way I wanted and therefore he didn't. So he must not be there. Right. Does that, does that help? Yeah, for sure. I think that's a, I, I have found when I had people talk about, and that did come up very much in our conversation way back when with Smalley was it wasn't that he's not made himself available. It's not that he's not made himself, um, discoverable or that he's too hidden. It truly is that he just isn't doing it the way I want. Um, and so I've, I've got my standards for how it should happen. And it hasn't followed that standard. Now, uh, fair enough. Very often it also is, I don't care how just somehow reveal yourself to me. And that's what David would say. Well, reveal yourself to me. You know, me better than me. If you're God, just let me know. You show me, show me in a way that you know, I would need it. And, um, but again, that, you know, that, that obviously cuts both directions and God also knows God may also know. And we talked about this, that no matter what he does, you're not willing to freely accept it. And since God potentially knows that as well. And so it's, it's a big, uh, issue when you have, uh, you know, God gets to be God at certain times, but he doesn't get to be God at other times and in other ways, he's responsible to be God at certain times, but he doesn't have any of the luxury or authority of being God at the same time. And so, um, you know, certainly we run into that as an issue too. Um, so Colson, I think of this as it's almost like the problem of evil where there's a pastoral side and then there's a answers, objective evidence side. You know what I'm saying? Like I totally get it. Like it, it just does seem that it would be so much easier if he just spoke audibly to me or if I just, you know, a few times a year saw some really clear, miraculous things to be reminded. Um, so I think sometimes, again, like the problem of evil that when I'm talking to people, I have to ask, is this coming from, I really want to know like a question looking for an answer or is it more of a question looking for an exit? Like I just want an excuse to not believe, um, you know, is your interaction with people about it? Yeah, that's a, that's a really great point. Yeah. Um, the other side of things is, you know, at the end of that definition, it was like saying that the author argues that since such non-belief occurs among those capable of belief in God, theism should be rejected. But to me, even on that side of things, it's like, I mean, I don't know. I feel like it breaks down with like, of course, I mean, with what we believe in free will, right? We can, we can choose not to believe or we cannot believe. I'm just, I'm just, that, that part kind of messes with me a little bit of like, so that's the, that's like, that's why you should reject it. It's like, well, I mean, if I can reject to believe, you know, reject belief in anything, right? I don't know. I don't know why that's tripping me up. Is it? Well, it's a, the question is, is it, is it a reasonable enough warrant to reject belief? Yeah. Is hidden even if we were to, so that's a separate conversation that is important. Part of this is, okay, so if God is hidden in the way that we've just described, does that warrant non-belief? And I would, I would agree with you. I think that's a conversation worth having. I'm not convinced that it is, even if he was hidden in the way that, that skeptics say he was hidden, which I don't think he is. I would also say that's, that's a fascinating conversation to have. I am not convinced that even if it was true, it would make sense to then go, well, therefore I'm not, you know, therefore we're not going to do anything. Therefore not going to have anything to do with them. Therefore we're, you know, pick it, whatever it happens to be. So anyway, I think that's important because I think you could choose to believe in something that you're convinced is true, even if there are certain types of evidence that aren't there. Right. So I don't think there's any type of, I don't think we're compelled to walk away from our faith, even if the issue of God's hiddenness creates a question for us. One of the issues with hiddenness, there's something, I think C.S. Lewis probably gets credit for this, is that, is the C.S. Lewis points out, you know, there's the issue when it comes to something like hiddenness of saying, asking the question, okay, so I'm, you know, reading Sherlock Holmes and in Sherlock Holmes in the book, Sherlock Holmes shoots a gun into the wall. And I asked the question, why did Sherlock Holmes shoot the gun into the wall? And so how would you answer that? Did you say why? Why did Sherlock Holmes shoot the gun into the wall? I don't know. I mean, because he wanted to. Okay, good. That's one of the answers is because he was compelled to do it. What's another answer? Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it. Because Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it that way, right? Both are true. Neither one of them cancels out the other way. And so to say, well, the fact that Sherlock Holmes, under some, you know, illusion of free will or under something like seemed to in the story, make a certain decision. But the truth is that does not take away, that does not somehow explain away the existence of Arthur Conan Doyle. Just because Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't show up in the story of Sherlock Holmes at all. He's never there. You read the whole book and he's never mentioned in the narrative once. That doesn't mean that he's not there. In fact, in fact, one of this is an interesting skeptic in a recent conversation with Dawkins with Dawkins was pointing this out to him and used this example. And Dawkins said, well, that's just, I mean, you know, he said, so what if I say, listen, well, I found this copy of, you know, what he actually used Hamlet or Macbeth or something. He goes, and I've been studying it my whole life and I've discovered all these patterns. There's tons of rules and patterns. There's these things we're calling grammar that, and we found these rules, these patterns. We found this thing called iambic pentameter and we found all these different things and we've continued to study it, but these things still don't reveal to us who wrote. Uh, you know, we're like, we're so now we've reached the conclusion that there, there must not be an author to Macbeth because we've, we've now come to understand the rules of grammar and literature so well that we've, we've decided that there is no author. And, and another person would go, wait, but do the rules of literature, is that the same thing you would use to discover that the nature of an author or the identity of an author of a book? I don't think they would. And so his argument with Dawkins was it does the scientific laws and the, like the, the rules of evolution or whatever, do those have any shot at revealing to us the nature of God or the identity of God? It may be that they just, that won't help you do that. You, what you're doing is you're coming to understand the literature, the book better and better and better and better and better, but you're not, you're not willing to apply any of that information to the author. And I think as theists, we would say, God, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is not hidden in regards to Sherlock Holmes, that it's actually his creation, which is another way of understanding it. So yeah, we, we've seen the world around us. Well, where is God? It's one of my favorite lines from the movie Contact. I don't remember if it's in the book or not, but in the movie, Jodie Foster's character says this line to Matthew McConaughey's character where she says, which is more plot because she's using Occam's razor and she's using it really, really, really badly. Like she's actually using it in exactly the opposite way because Occam himself used it as a proof of God and she's trying to use it as a proof there is no God. And she actually uses it exactly the opposite way that Occam said that is it William? What's his name of Occam? Shoot, the man who wrote it. William of Occam. Yep. William of Occam. The monk who originally coined the term Occam's razor, where we get the term Occam's razor from, but she says to him, which is more likely, which again isn't Occam's razor, which is simpler would be the actual question, but which is more likely that an all-powerful God created everything and left no evidence of himself or that there is no God. And the obvious question is, so did you just say that everything would be evidence of God? Like is that, I don't think that's the point you meant to make was that God created everything and left no evidence of himself. You mean, you mean other than everything? Some evidence other than everything that he, that there is a God. So anyway, it was fascinating when I studied, I was fascinated when I saw that. That was when I researched William of Occam and discovered that he considered it a case for the existence of God, his razor. But now it's used. Now it's often used in the opposite direction. Yeah. Because Occam's razor says all things being equal, the simplest answer is usually the right one. Not the most likely answer, the simplest answer. He's not talking about statistics. So anyway. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Chris, did you heard the Sherlock Holmes example? No, I love it now. That's great. Isn't that a great one? I wish I could say credit for it. I think it's, Lewis gets credit for that though. Okay. So I will comment on one other one that I think about with this and part of why I really appreciate the account. One of the accounts, you know, Chris was going through some of the accounts of people who, the evidence that they weren't going to believe no matter what. And yet we also have a few examples in the Bible of people who were convinced, even though they were very difficult people to convince. And of course, who we call doubting Thomas as the key example of that. Then we have a guy named Thomas who's such a skeptic that, that his rabbi who told him for three years that he was going to leave and come back. And then right before he left, he said, I'm going to literally said, I'm going to be killed. And then on the third day, I'm going to rise from the dead. And, and then Thomas miss it, you know, isn't there when he rises from the dead. But all of his friends tell him like, Oh, he was here. He really was, he was here. He did exactly what he said he was going to do. And still Thomas says, I don't buy it. I don't buy it. Well, that same man, according to church history, died telling other people that Jesus was the Messiah, that Jesus was the son of God, that he had died and rose from the grave. So how does that man who won't believe his friends, who won't believe his rabbi, who won't believe all of this, what convinces him, and it is God gives him, Jesus gives him that moment that he needs. Apparently he needed an extraordinary evidence, which was to put his fingers in his hands and his hand and his side in order for him to believe it. But then he does. I, my personally, I don't have to do it myself again. And when I have someone like Thomas who I can trust that he was, you know, not easily convinced. I am large. I am hugely convinced by the fact that he was convinced because it sounds like he was even a bigger skeptic than I am. And if he was convinced, then maybe my standards are too high. If I'm not, that's a thought for me. I don't think he's hidden. I think he actually has revealed himself sufficiently. I think Paul, I can't remember his Festus or Felix, he says in his defense talking to him, he goes, you know, about all these things like they haven't been done in a corner. Like you've heard all these things. Like he, Paul appeals to the evidence even in talking to him about, you know, what you put your belief in. I do think there is some, some value and Chris, what you were just talking about there a little bit is listening to other people's stories. And I, I feel like a lot of churches have moved away from, um, people regularly sharing their testimony. And I love that you guys have Regen and here at watermark we've got Regen because part of that every week is somebody telling their story. And I think there really is some encouragement of being, being reminded that God is always at work in changing lives. It just not mind that be right where I'm at right now, but it's just so encouraging to hear testimony after testimony of, um, you know, people at the end of the rope or not able to conquer this or not sure where to go. And then God transforms them, um, in a miraculous way. And just, that is really encouraging. And so I think that I was just trying to think of what advice I would give someone if, right. If, if you want to be encouraged, like talk to other believers or, um, you know, who, who are you around? And, um, I don't know that I just think that's so encouraging when we hear, you need, whether it's marriages restored or, you know, teenagers, you know, coming home or whatever it is, uh, that we're rebellious or something. It's just always so encouraging for my faith. Yeah, I agree. That's a, it's a good, and it is a good reminder that we're, that we do give ourselves the opportunity to hear those stories and that we're telling those stories because those do build our faith and we see it. Um, I actually, we've made a habit in our family of keeping track of things that, that the, the most reasonable explanation for them seemed to be miraculous. Um, and I, I have really, um, I don't know. I've, I, it's amazing to me that I forget because when I go back and put a new one in and I go back and look at the old ones, I'm like, Oh yeah, I totally had forgotten about that. I just, and some of them are really shocking. I mean, they really, they really are shocking. They, there's not a good, not a good way for them to make much sense other than that. And so, but then how can I just forget that? But I do, I have over and over again. So I think we're truly just bad at that stuff sometimes. Well, and part of the warning, um, that God gives, um, in Deuteronomy four to the people of Israel, um, it's in verse nine, he says only take care and keep your soul diligently. Some translations say, watch yourselves closely. Lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen and less they depart from your heart all days of your life, make them known to your children and your children's children. And I think part of that is what you see in the old Testament, a pattern of either people will name a place or build an altar or do something to solidify it or God tells the people, here's how I want you to remember this. Because like you said, Chris, we're so quick to, to forget in our, in our family, we have a little, we call it our memorial shelf in our, um, dining room where we just have a shelf that has a whole bunch of little trinkets or pictures or items that remind us of answered prayer or, um, protection or really cool stuff that God has done because I know for me, it's easy for me to read, you know, well, I mean, a good example would be the people of Israel coming out of Egypt where God does, you know, 10 miracles, supernatural stuff. And then their first obstacle, they're like, oh, we're going to die. We should have been, you know, let's go back and then, and then God delivers them from there and then they move along and then the next thing, no water. And then up, we're going to die. Let's go back. And you're like, people, what is wrong with you? Like, how can you forget what God has done? And that's actually, if you read all of Psalm 78, it's a pretty long Psalm where it just keeps talking about that word and then they forgot and then they forgot and then they forgot, um, of how quickly we just forget, um, what God has done. And, um, so I think remembering for yourself how God has done things and then listening to other people's testimonies. And then on top of that, you've got apologetic, you know, reasons to believe in God or the resurrection or the Bible that you can, you know, add on there. So I, I think all of those together, go back and say that again. We lost you there. So you said on top of that, you have apologetic and then, and then it kind of wigged out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, it's not. Yeah. I think you're fine. You're fine now. So you're saying on top of all of that, you have, yeah, on top of all that, you've got apologetics arguments for God or the Bible or Jesus and the resurrection. Um, and, and so I think of it as, uh, a rope that you've got all these individual strands that make a strong rope, just like everything else for evidence for Christianity, that it's not just a thing, but all of those added together, um, give you reasons to believe rather than even when you don't feel that God is near or you don't feel like you're seeing him or you wish you could see him or you wish you could see him physically or whatever. Um, yeah. Yep. Great. That's good. Um, let's see. Yep. The notes I read, they wrote down about what does it mean to see a miracle, the certainty conversation. Um, I also, sometimes you'll hear people say that, uh, because we've making some type of extraordinary claim that we should have to provide some kind of extraordinary evidence. Um, and I've never, I've never bought into that. I think you need the same amount of evidence as always, um, to make any claim. Every claim, almost any claim could be seen as extraordinary. Um, I understand that if someone says, I don't believe there's such a thing as miracles, there's only the naturalist materialist world. Um, and so I don't, therefore there must not be anything else why they want something overwhelming because they've got to turn their entire worldview on its side. So I get why they would say, I listen, if I'm going to change everything, I believe fundamentally, I'm going to have to have some extraordinary evidence. Right. Okay. Well, you're allowed to at the personal level, say I want extraordinary evidence. That's fine. Um, I would do the same thing. If you were to come to me and say, my wife is cheating on me, I would say like, okay, you're going to need to show some extraordinary evidence to me personally at that personal level, because I require that because of what it means to me. Right. But if you just came to me and said like, Hey, people cheat on their spouses, I would get like, oh, okay. I mean, it's the same amount of evidence is what's necessary. Even if I personally want more to be convinced, fine, that's my option. But to say that that's some type of universal obligation that I'm going to, I say there is a God, therefore I should have to come up with extraordinary evidence. No, I should just have to come up with reasonable evidence to show that it is at least a reasonable option to believe it. If not, the more reasonable option to believe it. And I think that's the fair and appropriate standard for any type of belief system. So again, kind of like Chris was saying a minute ago, there may be the comfort that, you know, there's kind of the cold, hard, philosophical, reasonable conversation about things like this. And then there is the, you know, no, I get it. I get why, why it's frustrating that God doesn't do more to reveal himself in the way that I would like. Believe me, that's frustrating to me too. That's a, you know, I don't know how many prayers in my life have included phrases like if you're there. But that's not, that's my psychology. That's not some type of, you know, reasonable or scientific argument. That's just my psychology. I'm just feeling that at that moment. Those don't cancel each other out. Again, those are two different ways of engaging with it. So I get why people are frustrated with what we call divine hiddenness. But at the same time, I'm always shocked of what God has revealed. Even though I would love for him to reveal more, I'm always shocked at what he has revealed and encouraged by that. So both of those can be true, I think. That kind of wrap it. What are the thoughts we got about this? Any others? I don't know. I think I just would always, yeah, I just would always encourage talking to the person more about like, so let's talk more about what, why you think, you know, God isn't there or is it just, he didn't answer the way you wanted. Like, I just feel like having a dialogue with someone helps you way more than just having a pat answer because I think I'm sure it's a lot of them are all different. I think if someone said that is the reason why I'm not a believer, then that's different than just, I sure wish, you know, God wouldn't answer my prayer, you know, type of thing. So right. Right. Right. Right. Yep. I think that's great. I think that's a good unpacking of kind of where that, yeah, where, where that mindset probably is where that argument sits and then how we can engage with that as believers. So that's great. Well, thank you guys for your time. And then you listening, if you have any questions or if you have anything that pops up that we haven't discussed that you would like for us to discuss, reach out to us via email or cell phone or whatever.
