We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg. We're in studio today. And today we're talking kind of the follow up conversation from the episode that Brynn kind of spearheaded on purity, impurity culture and unpacking that from your perspective, but also with Bruce. What's your last name? I don't remember. That's right. And with Katherine Covington. And I was there in the background, just kind of helping do whatever. And so it was a great thing to listen to some really cool insight. And so now we have Chris, we haven't had an opportunity to kind of pick his brain, hear his thoughts. And then so that's kind of where we're at. So Brynn, is there anything else to tee up this conversation that you wanted to say? I don't think so. I just looking back over it, there's so much that like you're saying, there's so much that we covered and so much ground that we covered. There's like a lot of different directions we could take with this. But first off, I would love to hear Chris's thoughts. And just as someone who is a therapist and has done marriage counseling and marriage conferences and training and yeah, just in as a pastor. So I would just love to hear your take on it, Chris. Kind of what stood out to you. Yeah. Any, any thoughts that you had from the conversation? It's, you know, it's fascinating to me looking at that, how always it apparently for 2000 years, at least there has always been the temptation to bring the honor shame culture back into the Christian culture. And it's from back from the ancient Judeo mindset of if you don't conform, you don't belong. And that's the concept of shame. Shame is that's what shame is. Shame is the culture's way of telling you whether you belong or not. And so if you don't, you don't conform, you don't live the way we tell you to live, then you don't, you're not one of us. You don't get to be one of us. And, and though I get, there is a place for guilt and shame in all human beings' lives, especially as just an emotion to cause us to turn to something better. The culture of that doesn't fit very well in Jesus's model. And a lot of when you have Jesus saying, you've heard it said, but I say a lot of times he's correcting that and hearing, you know, the three of you talk about the purity culture and to what degree it seemed like, just an effort to shoehorn honor shame. And at least at minimum, that's the way it was practiced was, you know what, you're a piece of tape that's been used too many times. And so you're no longer have value to our culture. You're no longer, you're no longer one of us or, you know, you're the rose that has had all the petals torn off or whatever. And so it's this fear-based, you're losing something that is the only thing that gets you in. And, and, and what a fascinating, we'll come back to this, I'm sure, but what a fascinating thing for Christians in the late 20th century to make sex that one thing. It's not the first time Christians have done that, but it's just the most recent one where we've said sex is the one magic honor shame conversation that, that leaves us hanging. It's, it's intriguing because we were just talking about in the sermon yesterday how Jesus is like, okay, how do you not understand that if I prioritize ox and donkeys, then obviously I prioritize people. Like, why is that not obvious to you? So we give a command that you should help an ox if it falls or help a donkey, if it's overburdened even on Sabbath. Well, obviously therefore you should help a person who's overburdened or a person who falls down on the Sabbath. But the, but the, they'd stop teaching that they had begun to say like, no, no, helping a person. Well, there's no law commanding that. And Jesus response seems to be, well, there shouldn't have to be a law commanding being good to people on Sabbath because there is a law telling you to be good to donkeys on the Sabbath. And so this, this issue of, um, as we've debated, like, you know, just in a conversation the other day going really, it's like the only thing that can keep someone out of church leadership is adultery. Like, like we don't, Paul doesn't say anything about murder in his list of things that well, we'll know because if adultery can keep you out, then obviously these other things should keep you out. Or in any way, we just, we lose that we want to return to this. You have failed us in some way. Therefore you're no longer one of us. And it's, it's not a grace based teaching that, that Christ is the one who did this work, not you. And Christ would be the only one who could undo this work, not you. Um, and so what a, what a fascinating return it is to how do we reshoot horn the honor shame culture into Christianity? Because evangelical Christianity largely exists as a walk away from that and go, well, we got to get that back in somehow. Right. Because that's, and so that struck me hearing y'all talk about it. The, the, the messages that you guys as young women at that stage were getting that, well, you're really not one of us because of these decisions you're making. And so how's it's not strange at all that someone like Catherine would go, well, I'm not one of you. You're the one who told me I'm not one of you. Right. That wouldn't mind. I didn't say it first. You said it first. Right. And so anyway, that's, that was one just stood out to me. Any thoughts or comments? Well, I think that the first thing is if, if that's then what's being brought in or shoehorned in, as you're saying kind of that honor shame culture. And it's like, well, you're no longer one of us. I think where we sit in the American culture that is separate from the Christian culture of like, well, let me affirm whatever your truth is. And we're going to, we'll accept you to me that it almost seems even more like right for deconstruction. If it's like, well, if my value to the church is where I sit with this and the, the culture outside of the church is saying, well, you know, we're, we'll accept you. I mean, you do you, you know, and I feel like if you, if you're not looking at it like you were saying from that grace base, what did Jesus actually teach? It makes sense that in a vacuum of, well, I don't know where my value is and where I belong that an accepting, seemingly accepting culture is what I'm kind of using air quotes because it's like, it makes sense that, oh, well, if, if a lot of people are walking through this, then of course you could easily slip into that deconstruction space because it seems like that is a safe space. It definitely seems safer. Yeah. Yeah. And like the identity piece of that being, it's also interesting to me because hearing it phrase like that, it's almost like we primed, we primed people to understand that everything about them was their sexuality. Yes. And it's like, that is the thing that we're criticizing about culture right now. We certainly affirmed it. Yeah. Whether we meant it or not, we affirmed it. And it's like, unintentionally or intentionally, like that is one of the things that Christians are standing against now. But it's like, well, that was a lot of the messages that were underlying. A lot of this was your, your identity is your sexuality. And that's like what matters about you. Oh my gosh. That's so, I don't know if we released the one where he talked about the book, my book or not, but not yet. That's actually one of the things that my book is pushing back against is that whole model of Christian marriage teaching that the only value that a woman brings to the only real value woman brings to the marriage is sex. That men have, you know, men have certain needs and women have certain needs and men's number one need and their number two need, their number three need or sex. And maybe their number four, number five. And that's like, that's their only need. That's the role that the woman plays in marriage. And so again, we're affirming this idea that like, listen, what it's all about here is sex. It's like we jumped on their Freudian bandwagon. Yeah. That the only thing that matters around here is, is sex and sex is awesome. And it's the only thing that really brings fulfillment. Yeah. And therefore you can bring fulfillment to your husband if you'll do that. But then also like slapping a Christian label on that, meaning like, also that's all that God cares about. Exactly. Right. Sorry, Colson, go ahead. Well, and I am, well, I think a few things. The first thing is kind of the timing of when that message hits people. I think of the purity culture movement, like how big it was in the formative years of kind of tween teen. Yes. Yeah. And if, if that's the main forming years, exactly, exactly. And when, when you're doing like, when that's kind of the focus of events or when that's the focus of, you know, outreach or whatever. And so that one, I think there's a level of like, man, that just kind of a level or where it was hitting people and how they're forming their identity is also probably plays into it. The other side of things that I was curious is how does this kind of coincide with the cultural revolution of like the sexual revolution. Right. And so is, because I know that it's not a simple thing. And so what is this of like, Oh, shoot, well, we need to, as a church, we need to kind of scramble to say what we're going to say. Right. And then it's like in the midst of that, we're almost doing a similar thing. Yeah. You know, we're, yeah. Culture is saying sex is common. Yeah. And we're saying no, sex is not common, but it's trash, but it's trash. That's the church's response. And then, and then within, within marriage then now, but this is the all that you can play it. Right. Only, I don't know. It just seems. Now it's trash you're allowed to play in. Yeah. How would you, yeah. How would you kind of unpack that a little bit? I don't remember if we talked about this in the other, in one of the other ones, but so the, the, the fundamental issue here in the root of this, what makes this an error, what makes the way this was taught the honor, shame culture, what makes it an error is that it does not model the family. So my son is my son and there's nothing he can do to make that not true. He can behave in a way that respects that are honors that, but there's no honor that can remove him from my family. There's no dishonor that can remove him from my family. That isn't how that works. The identity change is key. That's, that's what's key. It isn't a behavioral modification. Hey, you've got to create some purity here, kid, because humans don't create purity. And where this, where this mist was in the idea that, that, that this was a behavioral modification, it was a behavioral change and that's it. And it was meant to create an identity change. Listen, if you don't do these things or you do, do these things, then you are this. And which is exactly backwards from how the Bible teaches it exactly backward. I mean, golly, all through scripture, the line after line after line, every time I've, so far, every time I've been able to find a behavioral instruction in the new Testament, it is preceded by an identity statement. You are this, therefore this, you are this, therefore this. And this is what strikes me as so key and that I want women, especially women, but men too, out there to hear this refutation of so much of what you were taught. Your sex is special. Your sexuality is special because you are special. Not the other way around. It isn't that sex makes you special. It isn't that you're special because your sex is special. Those are error. That is not biblically sound. It's not biblically right. It was a mist teaching to the degree you got that message. That the only, that what made you special was sex. That what made you pure with sex, that what, or lack of it. That your sex is special because you are special. In fact, I would say that I think the biblically right way is your sexuality is sacred because you are sacred. You are created in the image of God and therefore your sexuality is sacred. Now you can live as though it isn't, but you can't make it not so. If you put your faith in Jesus Christ, you are purified by his blood. There is no sin he missed. There is no stain he failed to wash. It's blasphemous to say otherwise. Therefore you are pure, made pure by his act. It is finished. It's done. We are no longer creatures of wrath. Therefore for any movement to try to come back in and in a behavioral way, try to change the behavior of young people, or adults by the way, by making that a threat. You can lose something Christ has purchased for you by your misbehavior. So your sex is no longer sacred because you're a rose that says, too many peddled plucked. Wrong. That is a lie. It is not biblical. It's not sound. Your rose is special because it's you. That's not your sexuality is special because it's you. The whole time I'm hearing, you know, I was hearing you guys and everything I've read about it for years. And again, I was raised in a version of it that still really taught this. The first step of this, the true love weight step was because you are a loving person, because you love Christ first loved you. Now you should love others. And the best way to love your romantic partner is to protect their sexuality. Nothing about that message is bad. Nothing at all. Yeah. And I commit to waiting because that's how I protect those. I love best. That's man nailed it. Perfect. But of course, it doesn't take long before that kind of thing gets off the rails. It's being abused and mistaught as this behavioral modification. And the shame is the consequence. Listen, don't do it the way we're saying and shame, shame. You're not one of us anymore. You're not, you're not sacred or special anymore because of your misbehavior. Anyway, that is both ends, by the way. I will any more comments like because I got a second one that stood out to me as a message. I kept hearing in the conversation. Anything else there? No, I mean, I think that's really great. I mean, I would go ahead and point people if they, you've unpacked this concept of like sex being sacred and the conversation of it being taught as trash, like multiple times for our church. And we have those recordings on our website. So I just want to say that before I forget, if you want to hear that fleshed out, maybe we can include those Colson. But yeah, you've unpacked those a lot. And that's been, I think really helpful in this conversation. But yeah, okay. What is your next one? The other one was how often people were putting words in God's mouth. And you guys had examples of good and bad versions. Like if, listen, if you just abstain from doing anything sexual until you get married, then you will have a rocking, awesome sex life. Yeah. I mean, maybe I would, I would agree, by the way, your odds are better, but then someone who's got like tons and tons of experience and all that. Yeah. All the more because God's system works, not because it's like a reward somehow for your behavior. That's exactly right. There, there's a, it's not that that's yeah, that's right. It's not, again, this isn't his carrot stick situation. This isn't, that's not how he's, he's doing this. This is the way it works best. I know humans, this is your best way to go at this. And yet, of course, that's not, that's not sufficient. Just being sexually inexperienced does not guarantee you a good marriage. Like that, that would not be anything like enough to do that. Yeah. So I think, and of course it is counterintuitive that sexual inexperience is probably better for your later sex life than sexual experience. I get why that's confusing to people. But I mean, I grew up, I remember when my dad, when I was like in high school or ninth grader, he asked, Hey, my son may want to play football at college someday. So he went to the college coach at SFA and said, Hey, if my son wants to play football for you someday, what should he do for the next four years? And he was like, don't play football. Like the worst part is getting as someone who came through high school playing football, because I've got to unteach them so much. They think they know everything and they, he's like, it's such a pain. I would much rather him play no football, be in good shape, stay strong and fast all through your high school years. Don't get injured in high school. And because your injuries are going to cripple you, half of them won't get to play college ball. Cause they got, I'm like, okay, that, that analogy works. Now does my inexperience, is that going to make me the best football player in the field or guarantee that I get on the team? Of course not. But at least according to one coach, it was better than playing. And so I just, that one struck me the whole, even the, I think y'all may have even referenced the actual proverb, you know, raise of a child in the way they should go. And when they're old, they will not depart from it. And as if that's a promise passage. And that's not even a good translation of the Hebrew there, but raise up a child in the way that they are bent. And when they're old, they will not depart from it is actually the better, probably better Hebrew. And so you should know your children well enough, know how they need to be raised. And that's the anyway, but that's a, those type of promises, if you, this just this, then all this will go well. And, and you think about the, all of our lives and man, some, sometimes people who make bad decisions seem to, things seem to go really well for them. And sometimes people make good decisions, things, and the Bible teaches that, you know, we know how to be happy about it. But the, the nature of, and I think probably, especially that I kissed dating goodbye book is intentionally or unintentionally filled with putting promises in God's mouth, putting statements in God's mouth. You think that was supposed to be a motivator? Like, do you think that happened because they were like, let's lay on as much as possible to convince teenagers that this is a good path? Do you think that's where some of that came from? Yeah, again, I think this has been the habit of Christian leaders, all religious leaders throughout all of time from the first shaman shaking beads. It's meant to serve them. I can, and I don't mean that as in the guy who wrote that book, I'm not saying his motives were impure at the time. If they were, he was probably unaware of how impure they were because he was essentially a child. But that, the way that we put, if you just do this, God, it's the safest place to be is the center of God's will, or God will never give you more than you can handle. Like those are just lies. And they're, they're told usually with innocent motivation. If you mean the, sorry, the quote is usually the safest place to be as the center of God's will. Sorry. The correct way to say it is the best place to be the safest. No, sorry. No, that's not at all the case. Like that's just not, that's not true. We're putting, making promises for God that he didn't make. And that struck me as particularly damaging to the convert. When y'all were talking through it, hearing this is what my parents were promised about me. So they did this and then it didn't turn out that way. And who are we supposed to be mad at now? Like who lied? Was it God who lied? Is there no God to lie in the first place? Like those are the questions that I think are natural. Yeah. So thoughts on that one? Well, it kind of goes back to like these big picture questions, like we're talking about. I think a lot of this is missing. It's like missing the big picture and the underlying theological concepts that are deeper that should have been the foundation for a lot of these conversations. Because even the conversation about like a really nuanced understanding of suffering, you know, and like, and sacrifice and like all of these different concepts that go into those things, like you're saying of like, God won't give you more than you can handle. Like in the same way, it seems like a lot of these just missed the deep theological things that are hard to teach and sometimes accept. And in replacement, it was like, well, this is, it's kind of like how we try to sell Christianity to people by promising those things of like, Oh, well, your life will be better when you're a Christian. And it's instead of having a really nuanced understanding of life being hard and what it means that God is there for us and what redemption and forgiveness actually mean and what it means to like live in a relationship with someone who's also broken and has been forgiven, like all of these true but hard conversations, it seems like this was an easier route and at face value, more palatable because it's like, Oh yeah, this, this is like a prosperity gospel and at face value, it seems easier down the road. It's really harmful. Exactly. I don't know if that's, anyway, that's kind of the thought I had. Honestly, what's funny, Bryn is the very next thing I have written in my order is the responsibility of teachers to be careful, nuanced and intentional in the way they teach things. Perfect. And, and, and I heard that all through the conversation was like, you had teachers who in my, I'm sitting there listening, going like that teacher should know better, either does know better and oversimplified it inappropriately. It's kind of like that, you know, camp I got uninvited from teaching it because I said that the women's role in ministry was a complicated conversation in the new Testament and that the age of the earth was unclear biblically. And they're like, we don't want the kids to know that these are college age kids. We don't want these kids to know that there are other opinions among other Christians on these topics. And I was like, you're setting them up to deconstruct. Right. I mean, how many of them are going to deconstruct later when they're like, Oh, like that's not what. And so I think that's a mistake. And I think so much of the time teachers are just taking a curriculum and just handing it over. And I guess what little kids probably that has less effect, but man, with teenagers, that was one of my main jobs. And I was a student minister was when we would go to some big conference or something is every single week afterwards it was, all right, here's what you heard here. Here's what you thought you heard. And here's probably, here's the truth about it. Now, are there any questions? And, and what did you think? And every single year after doing these things, I would get kids going, I just, I'm just, was so great, great, glad to learn. And then what came out of their mouth next was just blasphemy or heresy or the most ridiculous. And I know that the guy who ran it didn't mean that to be communicated, but he was so clumsily communicated it that it was easy for the kids to walk away with that. So anyway. And I think that's something that we, that I spotted in those conversations was how often people weren't, people were having conversations that they really probably weren't prepared to have. And we want to have grace on that, but the teacher needs to say that even if it's mom or dad, and they're like, here, here, this is my best understanding. I want to keep learning about this. I could be wrong about this. We have to commit these things humbly and intelligently. And, and so often we oversimplify it and we create as shared. And I used to say, people create a God that is, I'm atheist too as well. Like, I don't believe in that God either. That God doesn't exist. So, and we had, well, I was just gonna say, and we attached to a, a idea or a concept that is being taught in Christian circles and is popular. Like we, we assume that because it's being taught by other Christians or is popular in church right now, that it's biblical. And I think that happens in cycles. We see that over and over and over again, about, you know, every five years, something or more often something else will come up that's like that. And I think it's a good reminder of, no, we have to go back to scripture or we have to be digging deeply. And it drives me crazy when people say, well, like, I'm just not into theology. And it's like, no, you have a theology, like theology is a study of God. You have a theology. You just are choosing whether or not you're going to engage with it and think deeply about it. And it does affect every part of your life. It's not just that's like professional Christians and a hobby. Yeah. Some people treat it as a hobby and that they, that is what they enjoy, but we are all called to responsibility, especially if we're in a teaching. I mean, scripture says that if you're teaching, you are called to a higher standard. James, James three, one, if I remember correctly, right. And one of those that, uh, when you're in my role, you memorize, right? Not everyone should become a teacher because teachers will be judged more harshly. Right. And I, I think we, we have to resist. Is it James? It is James three, one for we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble on what he says, he is a perfect man, which doesn't exist. So another, another thing that I was curious, your thoughts about is, you know, this teaching kind of comes about. There are different kind of movements and I'm curious if, if it reaches it, like looking back, does it reach kind of a sort of critical mass to where it's like, this is a benchmark or at least, recognizable enough to where a, I'm thinking now of a nominal Christian. Right. And they have a son or a daughter or a daughter. And it's like, Oh, shoot. They have their, they're a teenager now. And it's like, you're disengaged from their life in a way that's like, you're not, you're not having those deep conversations or a deep relationship. And you're like, what are, okay, what can I put in their hands or what do I need to do? And so they look at life way, or they look at their church. It's like, what do I need to do to, what can I give them to fix this or what is the right thing to do? And then it's like, okay, great. Well, we have these things. All right. I'm going to send you to this camp. Right. Okay. Great. We we're good. We're good now. I'm curious too. Like, I'm, I just wonder if some of it was just like, Oh goodness, I want to help my kids, but I don't know what they need. And so I'm now grasping at straws. Right. And then I'm, and then, and then now it's like, not that it did more harm than good, but it didn't, it, it is not, it did have, there are scars that come from that. I don't know what y'all think of that. I'm just like, I, I have little kids and to me it's like, there's a level of your brain is in a lot of different places and you're tired. And you know what, like how much of this was like the intentionality or the lack thereof, then brought this up and maybe I don't know exactly what I'm asking, but I don't know what, how did I think I do? I think I understand what you're asking. And that is where the humility comes in is that you recognize I'm going to do what I think is best, but I'm going to be evaluating it. I'm going to be learning new skills. I'm going to be an end to today's world. I mean, is there not enough books on parenting? Is there not enough podcasts on parenting? There's not enough teaching on parenting. I mean, there's not enough therapists around who are trained on how to train parents. Like it seems to me like there are so many options that, that like, man, you, you do, you're humble enough to know you need to be doing those things. Right. You go talk to other parents, you do what has been done for, you know, however many tens of thousands of years of human culture. And you go, I'm going to go find a parents who seem to be doing it well, and I'm going to get some time with them. Yeah. And, and that is a, to me, that's huge is, is you find all those different resources, but one, you've got to be humble enough to know you need them and humble enough to know that you need them badly enough that even though you're tired and stressed and blah, that you're going to still seek those out. And so I, I, and you know, the, the option of, well, I'm just not going to do anything is really not an option. No. And so you've got to, you've got to engage in different ways. You've got to engage intentionally and intelligently. So what is that going to look like? And that's incumbent on the parents to begin figuring that stuff out. And of course, we're not going to do it well, especially to start with. I think that's part of why they're so flexible and malleable when they're little is so that when we do it badly, they don't remember it and they're probably going to end up being okay. But I think that's, I think those are the answers. And, and again, of course it's a little bit scary to go, well, gosh, but every parent in those girls circles were reading these books. Right. And they were all. And so, and I think a lot of them were intentional parents who were very involved, which is, I mean, scary thinking about as someone who's like coming up as a parent of like, I was in a lot of these circles and I know, yeah, some of it was like a quick fix or like, I don't know what else to teach, but I think a lot of it was, they thought this was the path for whatever reason. And they thought it was godly and it just got detached from scripture, which I think was probably one of the main problems. Yes. Well, we had so, but not bashing a lot of those parents who meant well, no, and there's no need to. That's, it is funny. I've had several people recently in counseling, like I'm not, I'm not here to blame other people like good, because there's no point in that. Like it doesn't, but knowing why we do certain things and why we have certain patterns is still valuable to where we learned them. It's not so we can cast blame. That doesn't do anybody any good, but, but I will say, so an example that came to me was, so we, we raised our kids, when they were little, we followed a scheduling model, which there were some scheduling books out there that were hard line, rigid scheduling books. And my wife, being my wife and being as intelligent and biblically aware as she is read many of them. And, and what she would do is test all of it and keep that which was good as the Bible commands. Like she'd be like, no, no, we're not, they're not doing that. That's not, that's not sound. There's no good research for that, or that's not biblically appropriate. But then if there was another part of the book that was appropriate or sound, so she would take that into account. She talked to our pediatricians about it, who some of them had some very strong opinions about doing it or not doing it. And talking about sex with kids. No, no, scheduling, scheduling babies, just like getting kids on a schedule, getting the kids on a schedule as quickly as possible. And so, yeah, we had one pediatrician who was like, yeah, scheduling babies as child abuse. You shouldn't do that. Like, okay, so what magic age do we start dictating the schedule? And he was like somewhere between one and a half and two years old. Like what, what magical thing happens at that stage that that suddenly is a good idea, but it was a bad idea for the first 18 months. Well, that's just, you know, just not supposed to like, okay. So in other words, we have room to still evaluate that. Let's discuss it. And we did. And in doing the research that we think this would be great. It seems like a good strategy. It fulfills our role as parents. Now you read the book by, there was a guy named Ezo. Ezo's book, Ezo's name comes out because it's a memorable name, but people would freak out when they heard you're reading that book, like, oh, that's horrible. No, we don't, we don't worship him. We just are seeing what's wise about what he wrote. And I think Ginger, my wife, did a fantastic job applying what was good about that while not becoming rigidly weird about it. She was able to test it by scripture and research and seems to have done a good job. I mean, just dropped the third one off at college last week and all three of them are, seem to be doing all right so far, at least the first three, right? So I think that's a, and by the way, they might not, and that would be okay too. That doesn't mean it was wrong. But like, that's a good method is what you're saying. Yeah, you evaluate, you don't read a book. I'm trying to remember who said that someone said, beware the man of one book. And that's what I think happens all the time in Christian circles is I used to run into that out of Pine Cove where I'd be walking around during training week and 80% of the college students are all reading the same book. Well, I'm sure now they don't read any books, but it is a back then they would all be reading the same book. I'm like, oh, this is going to impact our camp this year. We better as leaders all read this book. Yeah. And one year as velvet Elvis was the book everyone was reading. And so I read it and said, this is dangerous. This is going to get our kids in trouble. Our students and our campers in trouble if they apply this. And so we better be prepared with a response. That's, that's what we do. Yeah. It's an Aquinas quote, by the way. Thank you. I fear the man of a single book. There you go. Oh, that's good. Yeah. But I think, sorry, one other heading, but go ahead. Well, on that note, before you move on. So I think that's such an important thing to bring up. And I hadn't thought of that in relation to this, but it makes total sense because, yeah. And I think you look at scripture and we're created to live in community. And so I think that's part of the beauty is like multi-generational people have different perspectives, people have different personalities. Like we're designed differently so that we live as a community and like, we're all being saturated by scripture and all filled with the Holy Spirit. But yeah, I think one thing that I have seen a lot as like a new parent, that the internet has kind of brought this wave of kind of what you're saying of like, I get my resource or my idea on things, my opinion on this, and then I'm going to die on it. Like, I'm going to die on that Hill and whatever it is, like, even if it's a really small opinion on something that's not biblical, it's not non-biblical, it's just not a biblical concept. It's just an opinion on, you know, I'm not going to list things because I don't need to unnecessarily offend people. We're only here for the necessary offense. But it's an interesting concept to me of like, okay, as a fairly new parent, trying to figure these things out of like, okay, how do I learn to parent? Well, what books, what resources, all these things. And then realizing like, yeah, we have a lot of things that are, that you've mentioned at our disposal. We have people who've gone before us. We have scripture, we have community, we have multiple books and resources and like, it makes sense as someone who is seeking wisdom from the Lord to take advantage of all of those. And what I so often see is even on small things, people will take an opinion and they will dig in the ground on it. And then because of how our culture is with this, like us versus them, it's like anyone who agrees with this is on my side. And anyone who disagrees with any part of it is them. As a Nazi. Yes. And so, and it, and it keeps us from having nuanced conversations about anything. Right. And so it's like, what if I read this book and I take part of it and I don't take part of it? Like, that's okay. Like, that's probably wise. Like if I have a book that I wholeheartedly agree with all of it, and it's not the Bible, like, I mean, I probably should be aware of that. Like, yes. That's just an interesting concept that seems really prevalent. And I hadn't even thought about it in relation to this, but again, it's that lack of humility that is killing us that we were not allowed to go or, or another option is I could be wrong. Yeah. And no one, no one does that. No one says that that's not allowed. And well, and I think fear and anxiety for like playing to that too. I think sometimes it's pride and I think fear and anxiety too is like, I want to do this perfectly. I want to do this right. I'm afraid of an outcome of not doing it perfectly. Um, especially when it comes to parenting, we talked to Catherine about that during her interview of like, and, and I think that is some of it too. Some of it's not even pride. It's just, I'm afraid of something. I'm afraid of an outcome or anxiety. Therefore I have to hold onto this as if it's salvation. Right. Wow. And if the consequences, I'm no longer worth anything to my community, my family, the opposite sex, then that's pretty devastating. Yeah. That, that actually was the, it stuck me as the trap that as young women, you guys were caught in very easily that this is, I am worthless to this man. If I do not follow his lead, I'm worthless to any other men. If I do is being worth something to a man, my responsibility. And, and so that's what struck me as the problem is the measuring stick was not even really about obeying God. It was still having value to men. And so I, like, I would have loved to have been in a sermon and have someone say, you know, girls, you're like a piece of tape that's been used too many times and you're no longer sticky. And to raise my hand and go like, to whom are you saying that that's theologically true? Like, is that woman less valuable to God than a woman who is a virgin versus someone who's had a lot of sexual experience, which one of them is more valuable to God? I would have loved to put a speaker like that on that. Like I need you to get on one side of the fence of that or the other. Right. I didn't know theologically where you stand because of what you're saying is no, no, you're still just as valuable to God. You're still just as treasure to God. You're still just as precious a daughter to him as any other daughter of his. You're just less valuable to certain males. Okay. Why are you talking about that from the pulpit then? Like, is that what we teach a lot about in church is, Hey, here's how to make yourself more valuable to human other humans. Like, is that, is that we spend a lot of time with that? I don't think we do. That's why it's so good. Like it made me think is the point the guy was making was that is at least hinting at, and honestly, God sees you differently too. Because if it is, that's certainly heresy. And I feel like God would take that personally. So I think it's probably blasphemy too. Like, it just struck me, this messaging is either so out of place as in it has no place in our conversation because growing in favor or maintaining favor to a certain population of males doesn't strike me as a high enough priority to make it to the pulpit, at least not on any kind of regular basis. I mean, do we say to men, Hey, you need to make sure you're making more money. You need to go into a career path to make more money because then you'll be more valuable to men who can loan you money or men who can borrow money from you. That's the deal. We need other men who we can all borrow money from. And so we need you to make sure you're borrowing, sit loaning money only to the right. It's like a consumerist. Oh my gosh. And it turns the woman into something to be consumed. Right. Which sets up this, like our further conversation, sets up all of even sex and marriage to be super unhealthy. That's right. So and teaches men like teaches those God or, you know, trying to got men who are trying to be godly like, Hey, you are a consumer. And this is like for you. Oh my gosh. Yes. Yeah. That is a, what role should that have if any, and that's so part of our conversation. And we started, um, by the way, at camp, I don't, where I don't know if you got to be on any of the Q and a conversation. I got to be, um, in part of the high school one. Did you get to hear the last 15 minutes about, about let's define modesty as a character trait. I was in the back folding shirts, but I was so encouraged by the students are having these thoughts. I was so that the students are actually probably ahead of us in this conversation. Yes. I was so impressed how some of them very quickly gave very, very thoughtful answers. I thought, okay, they've been wrestling with this question. Yes. Modesty as a character trait, not just modesty as a behavioral measurement. And so, um, I was just fascinated by that. I was stunned at the answers and by the way, including the middle school kids, their answers, I wasn't even going to ask the middle school kids, but it went so well, the with them preteens or whatever, we're at the, no, the eighth and ninth graders that I was like, I'm asking the seventh and eighth graders. And they too had, some of them had really thought about this. Now, of course some of them hadn't, but this is these questions are questions young people are asking. And the church doesn't get to say, Hey, we blew it. So we in the past, so we have no, we don't get to be involved in this conversation at all. That's not an option. Right. Right. We've got to learn how to do this. Well, how do we have this conversation? Well, right. Um, and I think we just talked about it here, which is you start with identity in Christ and that's where this starts. And you start with our value to Christ. Um, it isn't that he's going to affirm everything about us. That's ridiculous, but he is going to affirm our value to him. He is going to affirm that we're precious and treasure to him every single time, a hundred percent. So far as I can tell, I've not seen anything. Nothing changes our value to him. Even being lost doesn't change our value to him. It just changes our, the nature of our relationship with him. And so I, I was struck by that. And I, you know, you, maybe this is the counselor in me, but it makes me want to travel back in time somehow and sit down with those young ladies and go, okay, everything you just heard is lies. Everything you just heard up there. Not true. Yeah. Mom and dad, that conference you went to, everything you heard. Nope. Nope. Start over. Start as great. That was bad. You probably sensed it was bad. You felt like something was bad. Um, I remember distinctly the first time I read the first book I ever read that presented sex and the Christian world is transactional. And I remembered thinking like, I mean, I guess that's right. This book has sold millions of copies to Christians, but I mean, no, it's not right for me, but I guess it must be right for other people. So I must be the oddball until I used the book a couple of times and had people, you know, respond in such a way, let me know, like, no, no, no, it's not, it's apparently not just me. And then good research proved otherwise. I, I would love to see the church regain, I guess, footing here. Cause it's needed. Right. Not guiding young people is not an option. Right. Yeah. Did you have a question? Well, I, well, my, my next step was just going to be kind of where you let us Chris. Cause it was, okay, we, if, if you're a listener and you are somebody who's like, man, this has really been hard for me. I have a lot of wounds. Um, I have, I have, you know, whether it's a deconstructed relationship with Jesus or with the church or, and there's just kind of like a lot of question marks, where do you go from there? And what it sounds like first is you need to start with your identity in Christ. Right. And then, and then build from there, but, but your value understanding your value as a creation, as a daughter or a son of God and what that means seems like a great first step. Um, I think from there, what would be maybe your next admonishment? Okay. If you're going to start there, here's the track you go on. Yeah. What? Cause how do you, how do you kind of rebuild from that? Where would you other, other than, I mean, and maybe it is seek counsel. Maybe it is, I don't know. And I know that Brandon, we were talking briefly before that we're kind of, we're kind of like, we were a little bit trepidatious maybe about just throwing out names of goals into this person. Right. You know, well, I think kind of give some nuance to that conversation maybe. Yeah. I think like we're saying, even if we were to recommend a book or, you know, whatever, you still have to use the same, the same method for that of like, go to scripture first, excuse me, um, go to scripture first. And, um, and then yeah, surround yourself with wise people and sorry, I'm going to get some water. Surround yourself with wise people, get counseling, get therapy. Um, but don't take even one resource that we bring up or mention as gospel because that is part of the danger. And so, um, yeah, what would you say, Chris? Well, and even as we talked about several times, even our understanding of scripture needs to be intentional. It needs to be sophisticated. Like it's, it's not just, I found a verse in the middle of proverbs and that's all I need to know about parenting. I'm done, you know, spare the rods, boil the child. I'm done. I don't need to learn anything else. We're finished. Like that's, that is a, that it's just a, such a misunderstanding of what scripture is of what it teaches of how we're supposed to engage with it. And I, so I just, I want, I want to encourage people. You, you look to scripture first and you make sure you're studying it wisely and well. Um, so that's that I think is important, but I think so. Yes, that's one. And then you go to the sources that are trustworthy sources, sources that have been proven to be trustworthy. We're not the enemy of science. Look for those who actually have research. I'm amazed not only in the Christian world, but in the non-Christian world, how often people just publish their opinion about something. And all of a sudden it's gospel. Like, uh, no, that's not how the Christians and non-Christians need to learn how to use good research and, and how to unpack things and how to not just go like, Oh, no, that's, this feels right. Or it kind of feels right. Or there's something to this. I just, I feel like there's so much more. And so I, yes, all of those things are needed. We need to do the work, grow up and do the work, um, and see that it's going to take some, it's going to take some energy. It's going to take some time, but you probably spent many, many years and many hours preparing for your career. It's probably worth spending a dozen or so hours preparing to be a parent or preparing to understand sexuality within marriage, read a few decent books. Um, and I feel like those are, those are some great, um, some great places to start. And, and, and, but for a lot of us, there is going to be a trauma based to this. I think, uh, obviously I think there's a lot of people who have been traumatized and I don't mean that, you know, that don't mean that using that word too flippantly, but they have faced mental trauma, spiritual trauma, some cases really from what they've been told. And so, and that's what they've been shown and what they tried to live out. Really. And that's, that can be very expensive. The expensive meaning, oh, like a cost on yourself. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Also the therapy. Yes. And all the other things too. Yeah. But I think that's a good point of like, yeah, take time to do the hard work or spend the money you need to for therapy and good training. Because I think like we've mentioned multiple times, it does affect most parts of our life, even in ways we don't understand. And so it's, yeah, sexuality is a big part of our life and healthy sex within marriage is a big part of our life. But it's so much more than that, that like we've talked about when it comes to relationships and our understanding of who we are before the Lord and our relationship with him, um, and the body of Christ. And so, yeah, I think like you're saying it's worth doing the hard work to rebuild. And, and we've talked about this before. I don't, um, there are voices out in culture who are talking about this a lot, but I think we have to be careful because some of them while doing good research and making sure that the word gets out of the damage that's been done, they're not always offering things that, um, are healing and our answers to the questions. And I think that's also a, um, just a cautionary word of like, yeah, if they've done great research and they're getting the word out about damage that's been done, yeah, that's really valuable in getting the word out of what needs to not be done in the future, but we don't need to stop there. It's just like we've talked about here. We don't stop with the deconstruction. We rebuild and have, how do we have healthy conversations about this again? And maybe taking those people's ideas for, um, for healing. And for how to move forward. Like we were talking about even the scheduling babies, like, yeah, in, in a way of like, let's now test what, what the response is to those, those researchers who are saying, okay, these are, this is the research I've done. This is the damage done. And now here's how I, how I think we need to move forward. Right. It's okay. So do good, like, you know, look at the good research and then, then take that, you know, the, the next steps. And I think then also just test those as well. Yeah, test them. Yeah. Yes. And I think, so I think what you said is a good point, Brian, as we have seen, especially in regards to some of these topics are very reactive. I actually, since you guys have texted earlier, I feel like we could do almost a whole season on Christians overreacting to things and how that inspires, uh, deconstruction. And I think this is, this is an example of that. Like we're seeing Christians decon, I mean, we're seeing Christians overreact now to this problem. Right. Right. And, and that's not, that's not, it's not an improvement. Right. And it's not a godly response to, I think it's a natural response. And I mentioned this in the last episode, but it is a natural response to be angry and to be bitter, but it's not a biblical response to sit in anger and bitterness forever. Like that's not the, that's not where God calls us to. And certainly not how we need to then interact with this conversation going forward forever. Like that's just not, and it's not, it's understand, like it, I mean, the emotion of it makes sense when there was so much trauma caused, but, but I think we have to go back to how does God call us to walk as Christians in these conversations and walk like Christ, even when we've been hurt and traumatized and how we go back to those biblical conversations. You know, it goes back to the like all truth is God's truth conversation of like, just because you have been mistaught a lot of this and feel like you have been oppressed as a woman in this conversation, doesn't mean no men have any truth about this conversation. You know, like stuff like that is very reactionary of like, well, therefore, then you can never say anything about this as a man because, you know, men have misused this. And it's like, no, that's, let's go back to the heart of Jesus and how we interact and how we behave and, and do that even when we've been hurt in some way. I don't know. So yeah, reactionary. That's like a whole different, we've been talking about that for a long time. I mean, I started listing in my head all the different times that Christians react to something foolishly. And I'm like, man, and it's probably what almost, if something was going to send me over the edge of deconstruction, it would have been that. It would have been the times that I've run into Christian responses to something. I'm like, you Christians. Well, and it just pushes us, I think on one side, it causes people to deconstruct because of how Christians are acting. On the other side, it pushes us to do the opposite of what we're saying of like, we're just going to go to the opposite of this idea and now believe that. Yes. Because that's not better either. Right. It just seems a little lazy. Yeah. It's a switch rather than a dial and switches are always easier. Right. I got to do is click. I don't have to figure out. Okay. What's good and what's bad. I don't have to test it and keep that, which is good. I can just, you know, right. But it's, but when you've been traumatized, it's hard to keep any part of it. And that's true. You could say speak to that as a therapist. And I know we need to wrap up soon, but, um, yeah, I think it is hard. What I've seen walking with friends is when something has contained a lot of lies, it is naturally really hard to keep any piece of it because it reminds you of the really bad parts of it. Yeah. That was a really intense part of our conversation with Catherine at one point was how hard it was to make any comeback. Cause it's like, well, I know I can be totally fooled by this. I know there are people willing to lie to me about this. How do I know you aren't right? Right. And well, fair. Like how do you answer that? Like, no, well, it's not possible that anybody else would, but we're the first one you experienced. No, that's fair. Yeah. It's hard. So prayerfully, what I would, we would say our encouragement to anybody would be don't give up on this. Keep reconstructing, keep challenging those thoughts. Don't, if something you got in the past was a lie, it's a lie. That doesn't mean everything is a lie. And how do we, how do we deal with that? Well, these are some tools. These are some tools for you to move forward with freedom, which is our hope more, the more connected to the truth. So there you go. Great. Thank you guys.
