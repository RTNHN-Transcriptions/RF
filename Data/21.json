We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. I'm Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. I've been out for a few weeks, so it's really, really good to be back. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, they took care of it really great. Thank you for having me back, guys. I really appreciate it. This episode though, we are going to be commenting on David Smalley's interview. We don't really know how many parts it's going to be, but because it was a long conversation, we're splitting it up into more digestible chunks, I guess. Ooh, good language. I know we want to unpack a lot of different things, but is it okay if I just ask a question right off the bat of kind of, because I wasn't here and I have now listened back through to the audio, I have questions. I know our listeners probably have some things and I know that you guys have been thinking through it. The first thing that comes to mind is right at the beginning when he's kind of talking about when he started questioning any sort of beliefs. He talks about when David was being baptized and he said he was hit with this concept of how does punishing the innocent pardon the guilty? And so I guess with that, he also had a question of why would God create this plan that he has that is so harmful to so many people, including his own son, if he's in charge of everything, he can make this whole thing so much easier. So I know he's probably not the only person who's asked that question. So when that question is posed to you, what do you kind of start thinking of and yeah, you can go for it. My initial thoughts are always, none of that is an argument against God's existence, first of all, it's whether or not you like how he does things, I think. So it doesn't deal with any evidence for or against there being a God. The problem would be, and this is what I think came up a lot in the conversation with him, it's like, but that is weird or I don't understand why he chose that. Couldn't he have just? And so I think right away that I just, I think I would point that out. That has nothing to do with whether or not God exists. You just don't like it or it's confusing or it seems weird to you. My opinion of how God is doing something. Yeah. I would have done it different. That's a, that's a, and it's a, I think what you're saying, it's a fair question of Christian doctrine. Right. It is, it has nothing to do with whether or not there is a God. Right. And even when I listened to Smalley's conversation of going back and listen to ours with him and even thinking back, most of, most of his energy is spent, it's actually spent questioning Christianity and even the King James version of the Bible, which both of which are fine to question and, and, and to put on trial, so to speak. But it's a lot of his arguments, even if you just concede them. All right. Okay. Conceded. Yeah. Okay. That's a bad way to do things. I disagree with that. So what does that have to do with whether there is a God that's that's fair. But what's interesting is when you said just a second ago, uh, Colson, I'll bet he's not the first to ask that this is actually the question of the atonement. Not only is he not the first to ask it, but there have been, I don't know how many tens of thousands of books written in the discussion of this question. And in fact, many people still acknowledge it's one of those that there is still room for development. And, and so actually I have a personal link in this, my final research paper, my Summa Theologica for my theology class, my final theology paper, I actually still have a copy of it. And in it, I actually deny what's called in Christianity, the substitutionary penal atonement because of the exact same reason that Smalley said, I don't understand why God would be pleased, um, or why punishing a guilt, an innocent person would make a just judge less angry. Um, which I think that's why I think it's, it's a fair question. It's one that's been asked and we could probably do, I don't know. When I teach the atonement, I usually take about four to six hours to teach the atonement and I'm not an expert. Um, I will recommend there's a brand new book by Dr. William Lane Craig on the atonement. Um, and it's a great meta analysis of the different arguments and the different discussions over the last 2000 years of the atonement. And so who, who was Jesus when it comes to the sacrifice that he did and why would that work? And so you have the, uh, and in fact, if somebody just wants to experience that at the more visceral level, um, the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe wrestles with that very question in the end, the, the Jesus character as land chalks it up to the deep magic, um, that the death of an innocent can pay for the crimes of the guilty. But that's not new. Substitutionary atonement has been around. It's been in multiculturals around the world and it still is around today that there are ways that a guilt, an innocent person can pay crime for a guilty person. Um, and we still do it today. Did you ever change your mind? Oh yeah. Thank you for bringing that back. Um, well, it was funny as I wrote that and then now I went out, I didn't remember that I had written that. And when I read it, I was so stunned that I hadn't, I mean, the, the professor had given me a good grade. I was going to ask, like, it really makes me question whether they read it. Cause what I was like, now, carrying it, this guy had probably 40 students turning in 75 page soon with the illogical papers. He couldn't read them all that closely, but man, yes. Oh yeah. Actually I, I actually, um, was convinced later of the, uh, penal means legal, uh, the substance legal, substutionary atonement that Jesus actually morally and legally took our place. And, and I mentioned it in the sermon on Sunday. Like I, I totally make sense to me that a just God would hate sin if for no other reason, the fact that it hurts his, the people who he loves so much. And that's not hard for me to wrap my brain around watching drugs, destroy a family member's life, watching life decisions, George, destroy people's lives. I hate those. I like, I really hate methamphetamine because of what it's done to my, uh, um, brother-in-law and, and I mean, I hate it. And if I could take methamphetamine and send it to hell, I would do it. And, and I think there's something morally right about hating that. The problem is we all bear those sins. And the problem is it isn't just the people sin against us or the, we sin against us. It's that we sin against each other. And, and that's immoral. That's wrong. It's, it is evil. And we've all done it knowingly. We've all done it intentionally. We've all str sometimes strategically, and that deserves punishment. And, and a just God is going to punish that. I do want to, I'm curious, Chris, your thoughts, you responded to David a little bit on, in regards to, to free will. And I do think that's an area where a lot of, uh, a lot of the arguments from the atheist perspective, they really wrestled with where to put, what to put God responsible for and what to put man responsible for. And it kind of bounces back and forth. So how do you see this whole God created this plan as a charge of the rules? How does that integrate with our, our freedom? I think he was also, it's, it sounded like he was also kind of complaining, like everything that you read about just sounds so primitive and like, why is there so much blood and sacrifices? The quote is it's very archaic. It's very barbaric. You would think that God would be above that. Yeah. So going back, and again, I'll get back to what Chris said there, but going back to the original objection, I still also think it's not that God just came up with these rules arbitrarily. Like I'm, I've decided that today, now that I've created man, I'm going to say that lying is wrong because I flipped a coin and decided that. Right. Because I've, I've seen some of these objections before where they're like, why are, why are you holding me accountable to this rule that you made up that you can just, you know, just let me go. In other words, sweep it under the rug or, or canceled. It's your rule. It's like me giving my kids a curfew. I could change the curfew because I gave it to them. The difference I would say is the Christian view is not that God even commands holy things of us or expects righteousness of us, but it flows out of him. Like he is, like in other words, you could say someone is patient, but it would be weird to say that person is patience as if like they, they are that thing. Like the embodiment of it. Right. But we say things about God that he is love or he is holy. And so what we mean by that is his very nature is what establishes right and wrong, good and evil. And so he's not being petty and he's not being, you know, just, I've decided this is how it's going to be. Because of his nature being just, God is just, he, he has to, and I don't want it to make it sound like he's something is over him making him do this, but by its very nature, this is what holiness does. And so it's not even God punishing an innocent man for the guilt of someone else. I would even go on the other side and say the cute, because in other words, God couldn't have just picked Joe Hebrew over here and I'll punish him for your crimes. Right. It's the righteousness of Jesus that had to also count as mine. So the full substitution is yes, my crimes, the penalty for my sin gets credited to Jesus, but it's also his righteousness gets credited to me. Yes. Because his... Wow, that's a great point. His, well, his perfection, his holiness demands that I be that way. And again, we, it's not like he made this up and he's like, I'm shocked that no one is keeping these standards. Like he knew from the beginning that we were going to mess it up, because it's a plan from before, from the foundation of the world. Anyways, so what did you say about... Well, freedom. And so, how do you know freedom plays into this? Yeah, what I said is God made sin the potential, but we made it actual. In other words, if you're going to make people that are truly free, then you've got to give them... If I said your choices are door A or door A, you'd be like, I don't have a choice. Like that's my only choice. So he could have made us like that, where we just do whatever he programs us to do. But wanting a relationship with us and love is voluntary. Like you're choosing that. It's not forced, otherwise it's not love. And so I think in giving us the freedom there, he invites us to the individuals who experience him individually, but that just means now you've got the opportunity to blow it. And if it wasn't Adam and Eve, it would have been someone else or me or somebody who would have misused their freedom. But that's the other piece there where God, because he made this world the way he did, and again, then you can argue, well, couldn't you have made a world... Well, but this is the world that he made. And he did make a perfect world, but we messed it up. But he made this world with human beings that are free. And we're the ones that made the sin actual. Right. That's... I think I explained that to him a little bit. I think so. Yeah, this is a... You did. And a lot of what we're going to come back to, and this isn't just with David, but this is in our own hearts, in our own questions, is when we're making God, there's a dichotomy that's created when we make God, God about some things, but he's not God about something else at the same time. And so he's God in that, well, he's the one who decided the plan. He's the one who made the plan. He's the one who created this whole system. Why would he do that? Okay. Well, if he's going to be the God who creates the plan and creates the system, then he also at the same moment gets to be the God who knows how to create the right plan. And so if you're going to make him God that's responsible for one thing, you've got to also make him the kind of God who is powerful enough for that thing, who is all-knowing enough, who's whatever enough. And we're going to run into that with a number of David's comments as we unpack these. And again, I don't want this to be like, we are in no way bashing David or atheists or any of that. And so we'll come back. I'll come back and we'll unpack that some more. But I noticed one of his comments about coming to churches was that he loves to show that atheists aren't these evil jerks who eat kittens and, you know, sacrifice babies or whatever. And I'm just curious, like, do you guys, when you think of that, and maybe there was a day for that, but do you, is that the impression you get is that that is the cultural perspective? Is that that atheists are demon worshipers? Like, is that the, is that, is that something that he feel like he does need to kind of help people not know? I don't think so. I don't think so either. Not the ones I've met or teachers that I've had or, right. Or friends that I've had who just don't believe in God. So I guess he's just talking about humanizing that. And, and I do think an important part of for the deconstructed faith podcast for us is getting to, to reference what the first, I don't know, half of, if you just listened to it recently or last week, almost the first half of the conversation is about the fact that he wasn't free to ask questions. He didn't have the place to dive through these things. And he didn't even have a, a good source for answers. I mean, can you imagine somebody coming to someone here and saying, okay, is Jesus the son of God? Or is he the same as God? And having a pastor say, oh, he's, he's the same as God. He's not the son of God. Now, I don't know that that's what David's pastor actually said, but that's what David remembers. And then he goes and talks to somebody else who actually, their religious perspective is closer to know he is the son of God. He is not the same as God. And, but it's just fascinating to me that apparently no one said, yes, David, he is the son of God and he is the same as God. And let's talk about how that's possible to talk through the doctrine of the Trinity and, and what that means and, and how that is possible. And we've discussed it a little bit on the podcast, but that's just, it was fascinating to me that as for us who are deconstructing and reconstructing our faith, um, on a constant basis, man, that's, that just was a great reminder to me to make sure that we're inviting others to do that as well in our lives, that we're not afraid. We're not shutting people down. Um, I mean, it, it, it stood out to me listening to it. In fact, it kind of broke my heart a little bit was hearing the difference between David and I in our childhood, both of us, probably attention deficit, ornery, annoying kids who ask questions all the time. And the difference was I had a dad who discussed those things with me and he did not. And I had a couple of Sunday school teachers who would discuss those things with me and he did not. And it just, it just kind of, you know, makes you wonder about, well, even the way the pastor responded to him sounded exasperated like, okay, what, all right, come into my office. Let's, let's get this done once and for all. That just sounded horrific. I know. And again, I don't know the guy, maybe the guy had that attitude, maybe not. Maybe that's just what David read on it or is, you know, we all remember things differently. Right. And that was, that was key to me. But if it's true, it's like, yeah, it's unfortunate. We need to be making sure we're doing that. And, and it is important. He didn't bring this up, but it is important to understand as Christians, we can't fall into the fallacy of saying things like, well, because, because atheists don't have an objective standard of morality, therefore they are immoral people. Like that's not the same thing. In fact, the Christian argument is exactly the opposite is to go, is to say, given that you really don't have an objective standard for morality, why are you moral? We're surprised that you're, yeah, why we should go. No, of course you're moral. That's our whole argument is you are moral, whether you believe in biblical or religious or God morality or not, you still are moral. Why? If we're just, and that's where, again, you'll get to hear this coming podcast with him near the end of, if we're just complicated, you know, coyotes, then I'm not sure morality makes a lot of sense. That's what we can evaluate it. Anyway, yeah. What else you got, Colson? I kind of wanted it off. I mean, no, you're totally fine. That's great. I think, I think that's great. One of the things that I loved about the conversation is I think it'll, it's bringing to light things that we can go into depth more about, that people have questions about the one of, one of those things we just briefly talked about it. And so I wanted to bring it up again is the Trinity and you know, you guys hearing that, that pastor that he referenced uses kind of the, the ag analogy and stuff like that. I'm sure that people who are deconstructing their faith, that's a question that they have of like, okay, well, I've heard the, you know, Trinitarian argument, but I don't really understand it. Are there some like good, I know that all analogies break down, but are there like, and we don't have to go into it now. I think this could be a good topic that we talk about later, but is there like some resources that are good? Are there some chapters of scripture that are good to maybe reference or just even ways to think about it that can be a little bit easier to unpack? Well, I think the reason Chris and I both groaned when he said that example, we went, oh, yeah, is so here's an example. Modalism is a heresy when it comes to the Trinity. And that is the idea that God has just taken different modes or different forms. So in the Old Testament, he was more of the, he shows up as the father, presents himself that way. But then in the gospels, he shows up as the son and relates to us that way. And then from Acts on, God relates to us as the Holy Spirit. So, but what that means is it's all the same person. He just shows up in different relationships with us or forms. And that's not what the Trinity teaches. The biblical view is that it's three persons that share the same essence. So it's one God, and then you get the three persons. So the reason I said that he mentions the analogy of at the same time, I can be a father, a son, and a brother. That's modalism. So that's always a bad example, because sure you can be, but that's not the Trinity. You're the same person all the way through. The other problem with the egg is the shell, the egg, and the yolk, the white part, and the yolk, all make up the egg together, but the shell by itself is not the whole egg. And so you have to have all three added together, and again, it's not Jesus is only one third God, and the Father is only one third God. So that's why that example is a bad one. And again, it's just one of those things where you go, there's not a one-to-one example that you could go, this is exactly what it's like, because there's nothing exactly like the Trinity and the universe. And so when we try to use that, even water takes solid liquid and gas, I could just go, okay, that's still modalism. It's taking different forms. And so that's another bad example. So a lot of... A lot of things can be three in one is what you guys are saying. That's a good, again, something that should be deconstructed. That's the right way to think about God. And I think we, in an attempt to be helpful with children, we do things like that. We slipped into modalism. That's what you're talking about. Just to illustrate. Or tritheism, which is the other one, which is that's like, there are three gods, and they're three independent gods. This is what kills me about this. People freak out about this doctrine all the time. They're like, this is just so weird. It's so strange. It's like, okay, so all of the analogies show us. I always ask, okay, what's the strange part? Is it strange that he is three and one? That shouldn't be strange. We just gave a whole bunch of examples of things that are three and one. Now they're not three and one in the exact same way. He is three and one. They are three and one at the same time. It is possible to be three and one at the same time. What's hard for you is that it's unique. His expression of it is unique. Why is that hard? Do you not know anyone else who is unique? So that if I said, oh, Ginger's kind of like Maggie in this way, and she's kind of like Katie. I'm just referencing their wives in this way, but she isn't Katie. She isn't Maggie. She's unique, and everything I would do to describe her would still be an analogy, and you have to know the individual to know the individual. I don't understand what's so hard about this doctrine. That is not strange at all. It's not strange that God has a unique expression of a trait that we can have analogies for to show that it's possible. It's not possible to be a foster mom. Well, yeah, it is. Katie's a foster mom. Since Katie's a foster mom, it's possible that Ginger's a foster mom. That's an analogy. Oh, so Ginger is Katie. No, no, see, they just share this trait. They're both unique. God is three and one, like an egg is three and one. No, they are both three and one, but in different ways. It's been weird to me my whole life that people freak out about this doctrine. Really? I'm like, I don't see what's so hard. I am able to accept that God is a unique individual, and therefore there are traits about him that are different. I mean, he's God. Surely he's got to be different in some other ways too, right? I am powerful. God is powerful. Therefore I am God. No, I'm powerful and God is powerful, but that doesn't make those identical. They're both descriptors you could use for us, but it's not the same. He's unique and I'm unique. And so I've just, I've never grasped why this is so hard for people to say God is three and God is one. And this is the way in which he is three and one. There's one God, one essence, and there are three persons. And apparently that is part of the essence of being God, by the way, is to be three. And so it's a like, okay, I'm willing to accept that. I have to accept all kinds of things about people all the time. It goes back to that whole, I feel like this radical autonomy thing that we're in or the expressive individualism, that anything you say about you, I'm supposed to accept. Everybody is supposed to have that right. Accept God who doesn't get to have any radical individualism or expressive individualism. Everybody else does, but God doesn't. Well, this is just true about God. So anyway, I've never understood that one as being so painful and so difficult for people, but it is for some people. Yeah. And I think it's another example of people going, because it's weird to me, I don't want to believe it. Or because I can't wrap my mind around it, or because God is, you know what I'm saying? Like it's okay. It doesn't disprove that he exists just because you can't, I don't think we want a God that we can fully comprehend. I mean, then, then that would be weird. I can't fully comprehend my wife who I've been married to right here. And I don't think I ever will. I mean, I now have five kids, I've known their entire lives and I don't, they still surprise me on a regular basis. I don't, I'm not. So anyway, that's one. Thank you for addressing that. I wish. And there are the problem with saying, what's a good book on that or anything? I mean, every theology text that's ever been written has a chapter on it, every Christian theology text, and they all say stuff like this. There are things that are out there that are bad and people have argued about it for a long time. And people arguing about stuff doesn't make it, that doesn't make me, there's not a right answer. Right. It means some people don't know it. It is interesting. I think almost across the board, that's usually where a cult is gonna pop up. Like that's what, that's really gonna diverge. Their view of God is gonna be wrong. It's gonna either be, there is only one God, like Job's Witnesses would say, there's only one God, not a Trinity, Jesus is a created being. Mormons would say there's many gods. Right. And we just have three that we talk about in the Bible, but there's many people. There's more. But I think that's where most of them are gonna. Okay. That issue and salvation, of course, but. Okay. I was also interested, him referencing, you know, you probably had another one to go with. No, no, no. I want to jump into that. I have a few others. Some of them are kind of repetitive of what we've been talking about. So this is great. And I didn't, I'd again, I didn't push back because we wanted to listen to him and I wanted to let him share because I knew we would have time to unpack and to talk about this. I'm curious about when, you know, when he said, I walk, he said, but describe himself, that the only difference between him and I was that he walks up to the edge of faith and he, he can't accept it without better evidence or more evidence. There aren't barriers. It's that he can't accept without more evidence, but I am, am willing to accept it even though I don't have evidence. And so I just, I want to go ahead and say like for, for right now, we're going to, that's actually some of the next podcasts we're going to be recording is actually, it did require significant evidence for me to embrace that. And there is significant evidence that's there. And I actually think from a rational perspective, I don't believe in rationalism, meaning that it's the ultimate source of truth. But I do believe that rational thinking leads you to theism at least. And so we're going to talk about that, but I, I, I'd almost push back. Like that's a little insulting David. Come on, man. And again, I love David and, and we'll talk about things that, and he could do the same thing to drive him nuts about me, I'm sure. But, but that's, well, that's one of those like, I don't, I don't think that's right. I don't think that's a right way to say it. I think, I think there is sufficient evidence for anyone to move forward. And for whatever reason, he has not been convinced by that. And fully, I get that fully. But I don't think that's because somehow I'm just easier than he is. The Christians are somehow less sophisticated or less demanding or less discerning that we're just easier. We're willing to accept things that we know probably aren't true just because we want to. And I don't, I don't think, I don't think that's a fair representation of at least the type of faith that I have. So yeah, I'm, I was curious, I've wanted to follow up, but we didn't want to take, we already knew it was going to go long. So. Right. Right. Anything you would say to that, Chris, or? No. I mean, if you look at the instances in the New Testament, you've got the disciples when they knew dead people stayed dead. And so they had given up hope when Jesus died. They weren't like, right. Oh, but it's okay. He'll come right back to life. Like they really had to be convinced. It's again, same thing with, I mean, Joseph and Mary, she said, she's pregnant. And he's like, okay, well, I'm going to have to put her in. So until God intervened miraculously, like he was, you know, just people weren't just prone to believe anything that they saw or heard and attributed to something miraculous. They really were. Yeah. You know, I hadn't thought about this until just this second. But remember that he said at the beginning, David said he was a believer until he was like 16. But then, then he described he had never really read the Bible for himself. He didn't, for example, know is Jesus the son of God or the same as God. He didn't know that at that conversation. And so now I'm wondering, you know, be a good follow up email with him or something. What does he mean when he says believer? What did he believe in? If it wasn't believing in Jesus as the son of God, then what was he believing in? And maybe so there's an intuition for him that when we say, that when I say I believe this, that maybe to him, it's just the assumption is I believe it the same way he did until he was 16, which was without thinking about it, without knowing what the beliefs were. It was, it's intriguing to hear him talk about being baptized and going like, oh, I'm really signing up for something here. Like, oh, this is, that's a realization now. You've just realized, oh, gosh, this is, this is for real. I'm signing up for something. And I don't know what I'm signing up for. And that's an intriguing wrestling match. And I think we all have it again. That's what this podcast is all about, that you read something new, you learn something new and say, okay, what do I do with that? Is this what I signed up for? Right. And I think it's vital to recognize it's not like Jesus was negative about that. In fact, he instructed it. You need to count the cost. You need to know what you're getting into when you get into it. And so again, I mean, and then you can all, you can even go back to what you were talking about ahead of time or sorry, not ahead of time, but before then you were saying like, I mean, you had a dad who you talked to and he would probably ask you those questions of like, okay, wait, not only is he talking to you about things, but probably asking you questions to get you thinking critically. So by the time you were, you know, getting baptized, you've already thought through a lot of those things. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it's like, I think that can be just another layer of your story. Yeah. And how that is how that kind of played out for you versus where he might not have had that. Yeah, that's a, that is, I think that's significant and good for us to be talking about. Yeah. But even at church, it sounds like hadn't gone over a lot of that. I really like that it's South spring. We've gone through like the new city catechism with the kids. Because if you read that, it's by the way, it's an app you can get, ask questions. It's the old school way of teaching our kids, catechizing them, but you ask them questions that they, then they have the answer to. But one of the first few questions is, for example, how many persons are there in God? And they've got a little catchy song that goes with it instead of my kids know, but it's really fun. But I guess it's one of those things where so many times churches just tell them Bible stories, but don't really talk about the meat behind it or whatever, or doctrine or anything like that. So, okay. Well, okay. Well, thank you. Well, switching gears now. Um, what are you, how would you address when people are talking about, well, Christians are always talking about context, you know? And so it's like it, the way that it was brought up kind of sounded like, well, context is a cop out. It's a way for you to prove your, you know, your understanding of the Bible versus my understanding. Cause you're just talking about, okay, well, in my context, kind of a thing, it almost seems like, well, this is your truth, kind of a thought. Whereas, I mean, if you go to a, you know, Bible interpretation class, a lot of times it's like, Hey, context determines the meaning of the passage. And so it's not uncommon. And in, in Christian circles, context is not seen as a cop out, but how would you address that as you're hearing it? You know, especially if you're having a conversation. I think it's essential. So it's not a cop out. I think every time, every time you read a story, I have to go, okay, well, it's, we have to talk about that individual story and who's the audience and what was going on and what was their understanding of, um, God at that point or what did God reveal? I mean, you always just want to know anytime it's just the way we're wired. Like if you walk up to a group of people and they're laughing about something and you just go, what are you guys laughing at? Like you want to know the context or you look like a nerd walking up and just laughing with them, but that's just what you always do. And so, cause I mean, we even do that even with how we interpret the law and handling cases and stuff like that. You're trying to see what was going on in the, you know, in the specific circumstance and all that. So yeah, I just think that's it's, it's not a cop out or what would you say? Uh, oh gosh. Well, y'all know my analogy that I use all the time of finding the love letter. Oh, that's right. That's right. We've even done that on the podcast. I think we have, it's like, yeah, context, context matters. If, if it's not a love letter, if it's a grocery list, I kind of need to know that. And when we discuss that one passage and that's, that's why we really wanted to avoid that in that conversation with David. Uh, let's dig down into every single one of these passages that he could throw out. And, and also we'll say that's one of the things I love about David and also drives me crazy, but is, is that that conversation is a conversation David and I had five years ago. I mean, almost identical is the Isaiah passage that God creates evil. And, and so we unpack that and we looked at the Hebrew and we discussed it and talked about CS Lewis. Like we, we both have a script for how we talk about that. And, and it's still coming up. He's still, he's still throwing the King James version out there. And that's one of those that he needs to stop using. He said he'd stopped using some of them and that's one of them. It is, it is not, there's nothing about that passage that implies that God is the creator of moral evil. And jumping over to the fact that God created Lucifer does not change that at all. No, that, that only if God created moral evil in Lucifer, would that somehow make God responsible for evil. There is no good indication that God is responsible for moral evil. And Chris, I thought you'd do a great job of explaining. Of course, if you have a good God, the potential for evil then exists. God being good is never going to actualize that evil. There will actually be any evil because he's not going to engage in that. But the minute he creates something that has the freedom to choose and it isn't God, then, then the, then evil becomes actualized when any one of those created beings chooses evil. And, and evil also is not a thing because that's where people try to argue that it's, well, if God, then God didn't create everything. It's in, I think you said it, it's an absence of something the way that darkness is like, you wouldn't say a shadow is a thing. Although we talk about shadows as if they're things, it's an absence of light or blind, blindness isn't a thing. It's the absence of sight. If I were to say you have blindness, what I actually mean is you, you lack sight. So in the same way that sin is, is not, you know, loving perfectly or not following God, it's not doing something that God, right. God's nature is something that's not in line with God's nature. Right. That's a, yeah, sin is anything outside of the character of God. Evil is anything that does not line up with God's goodness. And, and again, yeah, that's, I think that's a vital understanding. But it's, that's not, it's not a new conversation and it's not even a new conversation for David. It's not even new conversation for me and David. And so, you know, again, I said in the, in the introduction, where I wasn't, we weren't meeting with Dave in order to convince David, I would love for that to happen and pray for that to happen. But we're doing it to kind of show this is, these are some of the things, this is a person who has deconstructed their faith. What are the issues that led to that? And he was very generous with his time and to drive out here and to give us this, some of these lists for us to unpack. I'd love to take just a second before we run out. Cause the podcast that you just listened to last time ended on the question, not of moral evil, but of natural, what's kind of euphemistically called natural evil, as if there could really be such a bad things that happen. And it's not directly caused by human intervention. Now, now with climate change arguments, I don't, I don't know that you can make that argument quite so cleanly, but, but okay. So, you know, when the, when the native American tribe died in a flood, God, we, we do have to lay the responsibility for that in God's hands. And we talked even about the biblical flood, which is obviously directly caused by God directly led to the massive loss of human life. And so how do we engage with not moral evil, but just what's kind of called natural evil, why God allows bad things like that to happen. So that could, we kind of ended the podcast on that note. So let's take just a minute and unpack that for a second as to why doesn't that cause us to walk away from God? So what would be your, what are your thoughts, Chris? I think we're back to, does God have the right, if God is the author of life and is all, all knowing and all powerful, does he have a right to decide when my life is over? And again, my, the Christian view is that life continues on. It's just, I'm in this life and then there's another life. Does, does God have the right to decide at what point he takes me from this life into the next life? And my answer is yeah, he has that right. That's, that's his prerogative. So the reason we get so upset though is because we have this idea in our mind that you're supposed, you're, you're owed 70 or 80 years. And so we use phrases like they died before their time, which is the Christian view would be no, you died exactly when it was your time. Like God decided that when Jesus was asked about this, I think it was the tower of Siloam. Is that, did he bring it up or did they come and ask him? No, they, he bring, they bring up another evil, a pilot mixing people's blood with their sacrifices. And he, that he throws in this example of Jesus wasn't phased by that. In other words, people come to Jesus and they say like, what, why did that happen? Or what was going on? And his response was basically, do you think that you're more righteous than them? Like, did you think that it was because they were bad? And it's almost like it's a non-issue for Jesus. Like that's, that's life. Like you should repent and you should remember like life isn't guaranteed. It wasn't, let me explain all the reasons. Right. Yeah. Which I'm sure is that so that if people are listening, they can kind of go back and read that. Sorry. I'm putting you on the spot. You're great. I don't know if you just, I'll find it real quick. It should be easy to find. We'll try Luke 13. Y'all look at, look over at Luke 13. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, there it is. You're right. So then you said the tower of Siloam. Okay, great. So the pool, it would have, this would have been at the pool of Siloam, one of the towers, apparently, I mean, we don't have any historical connection for this outside of scripture, but Jesus just references in, in this passage in Luke that a tower of Siloam at the pool of Siloam apparently, I assume that Siloam means sent. So it's probably a tower at the pool of Siloam fell and killed a bunch of people. 18 people. Yeah. So what he says is, do you think that these Galileans, cause they come to Jesus and talk about these Galileans whose blood pilot mixed with their sacrifices. Yeah. Killed them, killed them in the midst of, so in other words, this is idea. They were performing sacrifices to God, the most righteous thing a Jew could do. And Pilate had them killed while they were performing sacrifices, apparently. And so they're going like, whoa, whoa, you mean we're not even protected from human evil when we're in the act of performing sacrifices. And so the idea being, gosh, it's the most righteous I get is when I'm performing sacrifices, surely during those moments, I'm safe because God is going to protect the righteous. Right. And Jesus, that's, so go ahead. What Jesus's response is. Yeah. He just says, do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. And then he brings up the tower. So that goes back to again, the sovereignty and freedom of God that he, it's even with Job, like after he gets the news of all of his children dying. Right. He says the Lord gives and the Lord takes away. And so that's, blessed be the name of the Lord. And so it's the, it's maybe not what we'd like or when we think it should have happened, but that's where I would say God has the right to do that because he's the author of life. And again, people don't like that idea, but it's, we're now we're back to who does God think he is? We go, he's God. Okay. Again, this is, we're going to come back to this over and over again in this podcast. I'm sure if you're going to make God responsible for the tower falling at the pool of Siloam for even, even the act of other humans like Pontius, Pilate killing Jews and floods, then you also have to make him wise enough to know whether that's the right thing to do. And so if you're going to, if you're going to make him God, when it comes to responsibility for these acts, then you can't make him just human when it comes to understanding how and when to make these things happen. And so if I have perfect insight and perfect knowledge, then I'm the only one who knows when to cause death and when it's right to, and when it's just to, and when it's appropriate to. And so we want to make God responsible for all of these bad things. Gosh, he's so powerful. He's so wise. Shouldn't he know better? Well, if he's that powerful and that wise, apparently if he knew better, he wouldn't have done it. He doesn't know better. He knows this is better. And that's actually, that's why we talked about the difference between the logical argument for suffering versus the emotional argument. Because the logical argument is really kind of settled in that you would have to, so if you said it is morally wrong for God to allow this person to die under these set, it's morally wrong for God to allow a tsunami to hit an island. Prove it. So you've now got to prove that God does not have morally justified reasons for allowing that tsunami to happen or even causing that tsunami to happen. And the problem is you don't have enough information to prove that he didn't do it morally right, that he didn't have information to prove that it was the morally right thing to do. Now, and that's a gift from a logical perspective, that's almost impossible to overcome. I think it is impossible to overcome. That doesn't help us if it was my family member who died in the flood emotionally. And so that's not meant to be comforting except at the intellectual level. But again, going back to when we discussed this at the church with David, and you can go back and watch that on the website, David actually defaulted to the idea of a dentist and saying, a child cannot under possibly understand how it's morally appropriate to take them to the dentist. They hate going, it's evil, it's horrible, there's no emotional comfort in it. You just have to tell them, kid, trust me, this is the best for you. And, and that was him saying that when he got done, he's kind of like, I guess I kind of made the argument for you didn't you know? Yeah, yeah, in fact, you did. The defense rests. But it is a that there's the idea there still the truth, even if it's not comfortable, it's still true. And I don't like it. I don't know anybody likes it. But I don't like going to the dentist. I'm an adult now I make have to make myself go. That's no fun. But and I'm so thankful for all the dentists out there, by the way, you always get the bad rap on these examples. But anyway, it's it's a good, but I think this is an important understanding. If we're going to make God God for half the equation, you also have to make him God for the other half of the equation. And then all of a sudden, it makes sense. If you don't want him to be God in the first half of the equation, that's fine, then he's also not God in the second half of the equation. And there's nothing to hold him accountable for. And so we've talked before about how one of the things we run into regularly is this is this kind of there is no God, and I'm really mad at him, right? Or there is no God, and I'm really frustrated with him, or there is no God, and he does it wrong. And, and you don't get to, if he's God, then you're gonna have to let him be God. If he isn't, then he isn't, and you can't hold him accountable for being. And people pick and choose, they get mad, like, why doesn't God stop evil? But then you've got an Old Testament example of God judging the Canaanites who offered up their babies on the molten hot arms of these gods, and God stopped them. God did something about it. And so it's like, he doesn't stop evil and you're mad at him, but then when he does stop evil and you're mad at him, again, you're putting yourself in that place where you get the right to decide. Man, that's a lot. Okay, that's a lot. Thank you. It's the short segment. Yeah. Well, thank you guys for tackling those hard questions. I know there will be more. Yeah. Thanks for listening.
