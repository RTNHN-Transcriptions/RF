We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Chris Sherrod. Guys, I'm excited for another episode of the Reconstructed Faith podcast, and I'm excited today because we're going to kind of go back and forth a little bit talking about the existence of God. Is that right? How we're... That's what I understood. Good way to form those words. And what is it? I think the way you asked it was like, what is it that we've built on? Yeah. What are the kind of rational, scientific, empirical, whatever arguments that we find confidence in as individuals? Great. So, yeah. And my experience is that different arguments hit different people, which is kind of wild to consider. And this is great because if someone has deconstructed, this is kind of some of the baseline of, okay, wait, who is God and how can I believe him? And so I'm excited for us to get into that. So I'm throwing it over to Chris Sherrod first, and we're going to talk about a cosmological argument. Yeah. Am I saying that right? Yep. Okay, cool. I was going to point out first that all of these evidences that we're talking about have books about them, lectures, debates, videos online. There's a great one by William Lane Craig on the cosmological argument you can find on YouTube. It's a really good explanation of it. We'll reference that in the show notes. So the way I like to think about it is that each of these are like a strand in a rope. Like, what makes the rope strong is how many different strands you have in there. And so one of these alone might not be as convincing as all of them taken as a whole. You start to go, like, yeah, look at the evidence. It really does seem to be overwhelming. So to start off, I wanted to read from Romans 1 because of how God is described in this passage. So starting in verse 18, it says, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. I think we talked in here about the beach ball idea before. I don't know. Can you unpack it? Go for it. Can you remind me? The analogy is if I were to take a beach ball into a pool, for example, and push it under the water, it wants to come back up. I have to suppress it. I have to hold it down. So what he's about to talk about is what are the things that people hold down in unrighteousness or deny by their sinfulness or just choose not to listen to or to ignore. There's things that you can just know that God is made plain externally and internally. So it says, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them. Some versions say God has made it plain to them. For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. So the reason I read that is it says there is something that you can know about God just by looking at the created order. Namely it says his eternal power and divine nature. In other words, eternal would mean timeless and then really powerful. And then divine would be something that only God has, his divine nature. And so what would Paul be talking about or how can we then say, so it's saying that we can see those things clearly from creation. In Psalm 19 says the heavens declare the glory of God. They're putting him on display. And so even from Genesis 1.1, you've got a God who creates time, space, and matter in the beginning. So that means there was a time moment where it began. God created the heavens. People have said that could be space and the earth, that's matter. But the point is the foundation of what we're about to talk about is that there was a beginning and it was someone who was outside of time in space, time in the physical realm. So it's officially called the Kalam cosmological argument. And these are arguments just for theism. In other words, what we're going to be talking about right now are just reasons to believe in there being a God. It's not exactly who that God is or which religion that God belongs to. In fact, so the Kalam cosmological argument was made popular by medieval Muslim scholars. And that was their branch of scholasticism was called Kalam. That's where the name comes from. But the word cosmological part is from the Greek word cosmos, which means world or universe. It can also mean like order. It's partly where we get the word cosmology. Makeup. Cosmological. Cosmetics. Cosmetics. Thank you. Cosmetology. Anyways, so the idea is with this argument, we've got the universe in front of us. We know that exists because we can see it. So why does everything exist and not just nothing? What's the best explanation for what we have? And so your options are, well, the universe either has always been here, so it's eternal, or it had a beginning. And then if it had a beginning, was it caused or just uncaused? And then if it was caused, was it an event cause, like a what caused it, or is it a who question, an agent or a person? So the Christian view is that we believe the universe had a beginning that was caused by a personal agent that we would call God. But the basic principle of causality or the law of cause and effect states that every effect has a cause from what we've studied or observed. And the other big one is that everything that comes to be is caused by something before it. So this is where people get caught up with, well, then who created God? That's a really important part of this argument, that everything that comes to be had to have a cause. We don't believe that God... Everything that starts to exist. Right. We don't believe that God started to exist. He's always been. So when people make that argument, that claim, that's what you just go with. You don't understand the nature of the God that we're talking about. I think a really simple way to even... Which boggles your mind. And so if you're sitting there going, that does boggle my mind. It's not that it doesn't boggle our mind. It's just we're talking about the nature of God. That is who God is. And by being time, space, creatures, we have to use words to explain time. What was God doing all those years before we created stuff? Right. Because we have to think in terms of time. But He created time, right? Yeah. All right. Sorry, I interrupted you. No, no, you're good. That's fine. So one other, before I get to the official statement of the argument, it's helpful for me and a lot of this, and I think this will tie into even what Chris is going to argue later, in general, in our world, whenever a what can't explain something, we automatically defer to a who. Like when the odds of something are just astronomical, we just go, okay. So in other words, if my child's room looks like a tornado hit it, and then an hour later I walk by and it's all clean, it's all ordered, right? Which is rare, without some talking to... We're not talking about miracles. We're just talking about the things we've got here. But here's the deal. I didn't see anyone clean the room. Trying to explain that naturally, like, well, you left the window open. And so the wind blew in, stirred it all up, and they all landed in the closet on the bed, and in the dresser, the where they're supposed to go. Whenever a what doesn't explain something sufficiently, we naturally just go, then, okay, so who did this? Who cleaned this up? Even if it's messy, I'm gonna say, who messed up the room? Right. Yeah. Were you gonna add something to that? No, no, no, you're right. Yeah. Keep going. So that's the way we naturally... And so the more complicated or complex something becomes, the less likely it is that it's chance or randomness, those kinds of things. So the cosmological argument has basically three main points in the syllogism. The syllogism? Uh-huh. It's a logical... The logical formula. Okay. A lot of people don't know this. I'm reading, because my son is in the philosophy, I'm reading one of the philosopher Kant, one of his arguments. And I'd forgotten some of these things, but he, you know, back in the day, they very much so saw kind of geometry and logic as the essential to the same science. So mathematics and logic have always been closely linked. And so you have logical equations. And just like in mathematics, you know, you cross things out, you carry the one, you do whatever. In logic, if you follow the rules, you should reach to a necessary conclusion. Okay. And so it's set up where if A and if B, then at C. So it is pretty much like it seems like a mathematical equation. It is created very much so to be a scientist. And that is the syllogism? Uh-huh. So the helpful thing about it is, it's where you could... Everyone can see it. So the classic example would be Socrates is a man, is the first premise. The second premise, all men are mortal. Right. So the conclusion is Socrates is mortal. Right. So A and then B is going to lead to the third one being true. Okay. So going back to what I... Therefore. Therefore. And therefore. Well, and therefore... Yes. Monty Python shows the search for Holy Grail has a great example of when the laws of logic are abused, which was a common thing in the medieval church was to have the laws of logic abused. And you're referring to the woman who is... The trial of the woman. Yes. The witch. That's right. Okay. What else? We can reference that. Because woods float, wood floats and ducks float, they must be made of the same thing. Ducks therefore must be made of wood. And so that's like... Was that like a commentary though, essentially? Oh, I don't know if that exact issue was there, but... No, no, well, I mean, but okay, interesting. Interesting. By the way, if you're interested on YouTube, there is a great series of the old Star Trek cartoon of someone has assigned the logical fallacies, the errors in the mathematical equation of syllogism in, but they put them in the mouth of Spock on this great little cartoon and they're very simple, easy to understand. And so someone on the crew commits a logical fallacy and then Spock corrects them and teaches them. I want to say we actually might have references. One of the first two episodes of the podcast. They're that good. Yeah, they're that good. That's great. Because we had mentioned that. Okay, great. Go for it. Okay. Sorry, Chris. We're coming back to you. So the argument goes like this. Everything that has a beginning has a cause. The second point is that the universe had a beginning, which you've got to talk about. Is there a reason to believe that? And then the therefore is the universe had a cause that brought it into existence. So that's the basic argument. And then we would say this cause is the agent that we would call God. And the reason for that would be the universe couldn't have brought itself into existence because it would have had to exist before it existed. So for the first premise, I think most people have no problem that everything that has a beginning has a cause. The idea that the universe had a beginning, there's a few different reasons to believe that. There's weird, there's like the philosophical one about if we've always existed, we can never reach the present. Right. Like if the universe had always existed, if you go into eternity past, in other words, you've had to cross eternity to get to where we are, you just can't do it. You can't cross an infinite number of moments. Yeah. So we never, but that one's kind of like, my mind hurts. And the simplest is you can't jump up out of a bottomless well. Yeah. And so that's the basic premise that some people can wreck. Yes. Yes. You could never eventually climb an infinitely high wall. My simple example that I use actually is if you were to come in here, let's just say Colson, you came in and there's a cup of coffee sitting here. Um, it was still giving off heat. You could see the steam coming off of it. Uh-huh. You would naturally conclude that cup of coffee hasn't been here for three days, for example. Like if you've been gone for however long. And the reason is it's still giving off heat. It hasn't reached, um, stasis or room temperature rather. Yeah. And so it still has energy. That's what the heat is, that it's able to give off. And so if it had always been there, it would have already reached room temperature, right? Right. Yeah. And so the argument in another sense is the fact that the universe still has usable energy or heat that it's giving off means it hasn't always been here because it would have run out of, okay, everything would have reached, you know, stasis by now. The scientific discoveries really are fascinating because this is only, um, within the last 200 years. Some of it within the last two years. Well, true. But I just think what got this going was with Einstein's, um, theory of relativity and then the Hubble telescope, right? Different things that we began to, um, make more and more assumptions that it looks like the universe had a beginning. There's, again, there's so many scientific things you can get into that we're not going to do here. But can I comment on it? By the way, it is a relatively recent and an idea that the universe is not eternally historical. Like that's what scientists argued for a long, long time. And it wasn't until the forties, fifties and sixties when the theories of what we now call the Big Bang were really starting to come into prominence in the scientific community. Um, and, and in fact, I read and I read years ago, I read a physics book that referenced, uh, how scared a lot of the secular physicists were in the forties and fifties. And this was by a secular physicist wrote the book, um, concerned about, um, the idea that theists all over the world were going to kind of rub physicists nose in when physicists had to come out and say cosmologists had to come out and say, okay, it had a beginning and, and that all of the theists around the world were going to go, uh, yeah, see, that's what we've been saying all along. And he actually referenced the fact that it was a huge relief to them that most theists for some reason, totally foreign to them had a negative response to that. Like, well, you're saying a big bang started at all. That's not true. And when theists should have been saying, I mean, yeah, that sounds about right. That's exactly what we would have expected is that there would be an instant. And in fact, Lawrence Krauss recently, I mean, with the last couple of fact, um, on my website, I am reposting these over the next few weeks, okay, um, about the new, some of the new, uh, cosmology data and Lawrence Krauss, who is a, I mean, a pretty raging atheist, at least anti theist is, um, I mean, he's, he's kind of an expert on some of these things of cosmology from Australia. And he, um, he references, I have a quote in there where he says that, that essentially the universe began from nothing. And, and then since then he's had to walk that back for the last two or three years because he's like, but, but by nothing, I may not mean, he means the laws of quantum mechanics. Right. Is actually what he means. Yeah. And, but, but it started, I mean, the, the amount had a beginning, it had a beginning and he is, he, unfortunately in a moment of excitement for unfortunate for him stated what is, what is quite apparent to anybody who looks at the data is that there was, there was essentially nothing. And then everything expanded in millions and billions and billions of a second, massively like, like we're talking 38 zeros expansion in, in less than a second. And it's called, it's now cosmic expansion is what it's a new thing that's really being taught not. And by new, I mean, for most of us as lay people, um, but it's, it's again, the Christian response to that should be, that's what we would have expected. It doesn't have to be that way. We could have expected it wrongly, but no, that's what we would end by expectation, which, you know, is not one of my favorite words being predicted. That's what I would, yeah, that would make sense. That's that there was nothing. And then there was something, almost like someone just, just spoke it into being, but anyway, go ahead, Chris. Sorry. No, that's, that's fully related. And so Lawrence cross does have a book called a universe from nothing, but then if you read it, he does admit that the, the nothing isn't really nothing. The laws of quantum mechanics were there and he doesn't know how those got there, but they were there already. And it's the same thing again. Laws there already. Right. And that's what even Stephen Hawking said. Um, the universe came from nothing because there was a law of gravity. Right. And you're just like how laws have no creative power. Right. They can't create anything, but somehow they, so the idea is, and I think a lot of Christians balked at the idea of the big bang because all they heard was the evolutionary atheistic explanation of like, God wasn't involved. Right. But again, it's just another example of, well, yeah, the universe had a beginning. That's exactly what Jesus one says. And we shouldn't be surprised at now again, how man ends up interpreting that can be wrong. Right. Right. But the evidence seems to go back to pointing that the universe had a beginning. It had to have been caused because nothing from we can observe as a, um, yeah. And we would say that it can't be the universe itself or even a physical law or an attribute of the universe. Cause again, that had to exist beforehand to create itself. So all of those descriptions you start going, okay, so what is really powerful outside of time, um, spaceless, cause it can't be again, part of the universe itself. It has the power for things just to come into existence. Right. From nothing. We would go that, it sounds like you're describing God, which is what I think Paul is saying there that you can see there's something with eternal power and divine nature just from the nature of the universe. Because again, if we use that logic, if you, I might've said this in here before, but if you have this beautifully immaculate cake, that's just awesome. And I would say who baked that cake? And you're like, no, and the cake baked itself. You go, no, no, it couldn't have baked itself. It came into existence. Therefore something had to start. Right. Right. Right. Right. So, okay. So that's the cosmological argument. It's really short. Okay. Great. But that's a strand. That's what you were talking about. And it's, it's a good one. Yeah. Oh yeah. Really tough one to overcome. If, if you can accept as, as most rational people do the things that start to exist, had a cause. And, and if you trace that path backwards, everything is an effect. That used to be a cause. It was a cause that led to certain effects and then those effects become causes that lead to new effects. Right. And so you trace it backwards. Well, you either have to trace it backwards infinitely, meaning it goes on forever, which again, there are very, very sound reasons to think it is not plausible or possible that the universe could be, have an infinite history. Um, so the other option is there is a first cause and there's, it's, it's really hard to, to say, no, it's neither one of those there. It doesn't go back infinitely and there isn't a first cause. And it's, it's very, very difficult to argue opposite of that. You know, Einstein purposely tried to avoid it in his theory. He, he added this, this constant in his formula for the purpose of the universe, not having a beginning. And later he kind of got called on that by people who saw where his argument, I mean, where his, his reasoning was going in his, his equations. And he had to admit like, I just added that in there and he retracted it. Yeah. But it's a good example of even what we just read there, people suppressing the truth of, he just didn't want it. Right. He didn't want the universe. Even a brilliant man like Einstein didn't want the universe to have a beginning because then now you're on, now it's a theological issue and all these other things. And, and as I understand it, by the end of his life, Einstein was what we would call a something of a theist, but it's, it's what would be called kind of the Spinoza God, meaning the universe itself is kind of an intelligent creator. And there's, there's holes in that obviously, but, uh, but it is much more, it is certainly much more rational than going, no, it lasts, it's came from forever or it has a, an unstart. And that's one of the more we're, we're seeing more, you see more and more people making that argument of, of, okay, I'm stuck with there being some, some cause. And so how do I then explain that cause? Yeah. Um, anyway, um, so now, so if we're going to throw it from your, your argument, we're going to throw it over to Chris, what are you going to unpack for us today? This is what's cool is mine, my favorite one. And I love the cosmological argument. My favorite window across the years has always been what's called the teleological argument. I actually have no memory of being introduced to the concept of God. Um, we do know that there is good sociological evidence, psychological evidence that children are very, very open from the very, very beginning to claims of the supernatural to the idea of there being a God. Like it actually is potentially, you know, uh, atheist will sometimes say the default state is to not believe. And then you should have evidence to believe, but it turns out with humans, it seems like the default state actually is some degree of belief. Um, at least in some kind of cause. So, so the, uh, I don't remember, what I do remember is as, cause I remember standing on a driveway doing this and I know I moved away from this house by the time I was five. Uh-huh. As I remember getting arguments with friends. So this is how religion starts getting an arguments with friends. And we didn't go to church, by the way, I have no idea where I picked up any of this standing, having an argument with friends and us each taking turns praying and asking God, which one of us was right. And then God always told us, we, you know, each, each of us, it was like, well, God told me I was right. And the other guy was like, well, that well, God told me I was right. And like, and so like, I was like the first, the first religion right here. That's a, um, but I don't remember. I mean, my parents were raised as Christians, but my home was not a Christian home at that age. I'm two or three, four years old. We didn't go to church. We didn't go to vacation Bible school. We didn't do any of that. And so, yeah. And, and I know we went, I went to an Episcopal school in first grade, so I must've been introduced to it by then, but this is preschool. We're talking three years old. I don't remember how I was introduced to the concept of God. But I had an intuition for understanding there was a higher authority there. Well, the teleological argument, when I first heard it, I just loved it, which is funny because I'm not a math guy normally, but teleology and explain the word telos. Telos actually means ending, um, or, or finality, or even the way it comes to me, what has come to me in the philosophical world is T T ideology is the, is the end purpose, why something is. Yeah. Um, and so it's the cause by which something arises. And so it's the answer to the question, not how, but why, why does this exist? Um, and so the, the famous version of it is called the watchmaker argument. And so this is the kind of the ancient expression of it has, has several recapitulations over the, over time. But the watchmaker argument says, um, if you're walking along a beach and you find a watch and we're talking about backward watches are made out of nothing but glass and metal. Cogs and wheels. Well, all of the component parts of a watch exist on a beach. I mean, you have the silicon for the glass, you've got the parts of metal, you've got whatever that if you find a watch laying on a beach, it would be irrational to assume that the component parts of a watch came together on their own wound themselves and began to tick off the seconds. That would be irrational. Why? Well, clearly a watch exists to perform a certain purpose and the more complicated the system is the stronger in evidence it is of an intentionality of a teleos, a teleology, an end purpose. It exists here for a reason. And so that's what for me, I immediately, when I heard that argument that when we uncover something extremely complex, it's a little bit irrational to say, Oh, well that must have come into existence of its own natural causes. So it's even beyond the cosmological argument, which says there has to be a first cause. And the teleological argument says now add purpose to that, add significance to that. And so the argument for teleology is if something has a design purpose, it has a designer and potentially creator. And that's the argument that the teleological argument makes. Is it Paley? William Paley? Paley? Which came up with the watch example? I don't know. I don't know that. I mean, I'm sure at one point I knew who actually designed the first time, but the teleological argument goes way back. I mean, it's pre-Christian. The teleological argument you had, you had Greek philosophers using the teleological argument way back then before there were watches, they were making an argument based on design and purpose. Yeah. And then when you attach the modern day, which I'm not going to unpack here, but when you attach the modern day intelligent design arguments and stuff like that, some of which are mocked by secular, well, most of them are probably going to be mocked by secular scientists, but that doesn't mean they're not sound. There are very good sound arguments for arguments like how specific the universe is to, and not only the universe, but our solar system, not just our solar system, but our wing of the solar system, our planet, all that are created so intentionally to allow for life. The chances are so astronomically ridiculous that you would get such a thing as just the conditions that allow for life. Not that not life, conditions that would allow for life. It's often called the Goldilocks zone. I'm not too hot, not too cold, but just right. And there aren't many of those. And when you start adding up all the things necessary to have that we know that life would almost certainly never have it arisen on this planet. And keep in mind, by the way, all of this is theoretical because we haven't yet created life and we don't know how life came into existence from a purely naturalist perspective, purely secular perspective. There is yet no spark of life happening in a lab somewhere. We're not going from not life to life. So we actually don't know what the conditions are, but the ones that we do know, you have to have this type of atmosphere, this type of temperature, this is too hot, this is too cold. Even with what we do know would keep life from happening, you're stuck with an incredibly narrow perspective. I always think it's funny that the only example they ever come up with are the Stanley Miller and Yuri experiments in the 50s where they created some kind of amino acids as if we had created life in the lab, which isn't true. Not even close. But all they can do is go back to that because that's what they thought at the time. But I always laugh at the idea that if we ever did create it, then we just demonstrated that intelligence was necessary. Right. Exactly. Because we were the ones that were... It was a little unwinnable. I will admit. And it would be impressive to me and it would mean something to me. Now, again, I have no problem with there being a natural process by which life comes into it. That doesn't throw me off at all. That just means that doesn't explain a way God. And we'll talk about that another time. Process arguments, like how something happens, does not explain away a who or a why. And so we're going with a who with the cosmological argument. I'm going with a why with the teleological argument. There has to be design behind purpose. And you're left with these, like, what would be the statistical odds? Is it possible for a watch to come together, component parts of a watch to come together given enough time and enough changes and circumstances? And anyone could probably say, well, theoretically, it is possible. But theoretically, possible isn't the same thing as rational. Right. Well, of all the options, there's this one, and there's this one. This one is and so there's been some great ones over the years that I love. I actually have over there in my bookshelf, what I sometimes do to teach people statistics, because people don't know it's a magic trick that I do where I have 10 playing cards and I tell people, okay, pull out the first playing card, or I'll say, what are the odds, you know, if you mix them up and throw them in the bag, and they do and they mix them up and they throw them in the bag, and I go, so if I close my eyes and reach in, what are the odds? It's the ace through 10. What are the odds we pulling out the ace first? And it is, yes, boys? One in 10. One in 10. Very good. And so I pull it out, I pull out the ace. Like, tell me when you stop believing me. Tell me when you go, this is a designed trick. This is a trick. When do you know it's irrational for you to continue to believe that this is random chance? I put the ace back in and I reach in and pull out the two. One in 10 still. No, not next. So doing it next increases it to the power of the options. Now it's one in 100. Oh, to do it again. Mm-hmm. And so to do the ace first and the deuce second is one in 100. So the deuce back in, chances are you pull out the three next, is one in a thousand. So to do 10 things in a row is one in 10 billion, by the way. To do 10, you have 10 options and you do all 10 in a precisely predicted order. Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. If you did it by random chance, you would expect to do it one time out of 10 billion times. Yeah. Okay. And yet I'm sitting here doing it in front of you on command. When do you go? Okay, what's the trick? Well, most people, I have people raise their hand, like put your hand down when you think this is a trick. And of course, a lot of people are instantly like, well, you've got a bag on stage. It's probably a trick. Like, good. Okay, that's, that is a rational attitude. No one gets past one in 10,000, 100,000. Like, how many of you people buy lottery tickets? You should, if you're not willing to do it now, you should be not buying lottery tickets. But the odds of that, and so we don't understand odds. So here are some examples that are my favorite. To go back to Einstein, here's one of Einstein's quotes. The idea that this universe and all its multifold order and precision is the result of blind chance is as credible as the idea that if a print shop blew up, all the type would fall down again in the finished fault list form of a dictionary. So that is, I don't know what the, how you apply odds to that, but it's, that's big. Yeah. For years, there was a professor at Texas A&M, an engineer or a physicist, physics professor who said that he, he figured it was equivalent to approximately taking all of the matter in the universe and moving it to its molecular level and turning each of those molecules into a universe and putting all those to their molecular level, taking all those molecules and painting them all black, and then paint one white, one molecule white, put them in a bag and mix it up. And the odds of life coming into existence on earth would be approximately like drawing the white marble on one attempt. And so, it's, and my other one is, have you ever heard that in the scopes monkey trials, or there's the whole, if you give the exact quote ended up being something like, yeah, if you give half a dozen, the actual original quote was half a dozen apes, typewriters, they would eventually create the works of William Shakespeare. Yeah. And so, which now if you ask people, they'll say like, if you give a million monkeys, a million typewriters, eventually those are, and so it turns out this has now been, this study has not been run. We can now do it online because you can do those type of mathematical equations online and have them run. So, the original monkey Shakespeare simulator, which I got to be a part of, by the way, it was, it's so long ago that you had to, when you attached your computer to it, it started using your computer's power to run the program. And so, the original, the original simulator created enough monkeys that had created 10 to the 35th power pages of randomly typed text by the monkeys. So, it's 10 with 35 zeros. By the time they did this, there were more monkey, because the monkeys doubled every day in order to do this, start with a million, and then, and every day it doubled, a day was one second in the program. The program ran for several years, and it was, it ended up being 10 to the something like 38th power monkeys, which is more monkeys than there is space for in the entire universe. And if every, and that's, that's if you even have monkeys in space, not just on planets and stars, but just in space. And they had typed enough pages that there was not room for all the pages in universe. And at that point, the longest string was 23 letters, 23 letters. See, statistics don't work the way we think they do. You go, oh, if you take a random thing and you add enough time, eventually you get it. And the conclusion actually was, it turns out if you gave essentially an infinite number of monkeys, an essentially infinite amount of time, they will essentially never type the works of William Shakespeare, because that's how that works. In fact, I just got to tell you this, I saw this in the, in 2003, a zoo carried out a practical test by giving a keyboard to an actual six crested macaws. And after a month, that's the crack of this. After a month, the monkeys had produced five pages of the letter S and then broke the keyboard. Anyway, that's just funny. But, but the teleological argument is based on you start picking things and especially start picking things that are, are self refuting. Like Professor Bear years ago, who was a naturalist for a long time, when he finally did the data and finally did the research and came to the conclusion that like with amino acids, we talked about that, that, that amino acids have to predate DNA, but DNA is necessary or RNA, I can't remember now, it's been too long, it's necessary to get the amino acids, complex amino acids. And he, the minute he realized that you have two different things that each are a precursor of the other one, he said, well, now I'm stuck with a designer. Yeah. Because neither one of these can lead to the other one's existence. And yet each of them depend on the other's existence. Wow. The same thing is and Darwin talked about that when you get to, when you get to tooth, when you get to things that cannot develop, cannot build from one another, that you have 34, you know, like I'm telling me there's a flagellal tail, the tail on the flagellal, the flagellum has like 34 moving parts that makes it any, any breakdown of them essentially leads to a dead flagellum. And so you have to think that by chance, all 34, all 34 items appear to essentially simultaneously. I know they can work it out a little bit and worked. And so at some point, it's rash. Were you gonna say something? No, I was gonna say, Darwin's black box is the book that I first read that explained that Michael Behe. Yeah, that's a really good one. You're gonna geek out. Yeah. And they've done the discovery. What's that? Institute. Yeah. The discovery Institute. And they've done some really great work on design. And there has been updated research. And I know that if I remember correctly, someone came back later and said like, actually, you can divide the flagellal tail 12 different times within those 34 items, because someone ran it and tested it. And the problem is, that still leaves you with, with like 22 different options that lead to the death of the, even if that was right, it still doesn't come even close to getting you there. But I'm making up numbers right now. And I apologize for that, because I don't know I'm off top of my head. But when you're left with things as complex as the human eye, which is a great example, or one of my favorites, giraffes, necks that if you have all the all the breakdown of a giraffe's neck, and it doesn't, and yet you don't have the whole thing, every stage along the way would lead to a dead giraffe. And yet the current giraffe without the whole thing would be also be dead. And there's all these examples of things that are so complex and so intentional, that I think it is rational. And this is why I tell people it, my argument is, I think it what I wanted people to hear is it is rational to believe there is a God that is not an irrational perspective, to think there is a creator, there's a first cause, there is a designer, there's a good, solid, rational arguments, and they are continued to be backed by scientific discoveries. They continue to be defended by logical arguments. And I, anyway, those are when I think back on I need a better explanation than a designer for the purpose of creation. For someone to break the laws of statistics of the degree they've been broken. I have to either believe in blind chance as what would lead to this, but I literally would say, statistically, I don't have the faith for it. Right, right. That's what I was gonna say. It's the Frank Turek wrote a book called I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist. Right. Because you do start to get to the point where you're going, you're just saying that's to not believe that, to think that it happened by chance is getting ridiculous. My dad is a is an environmental scientist. And we had a family member recently kind of tell him that she's an atheist. And he immediately said, he's like, no, no, at least you mean deist. I mean, at least you mean theist. Listen, as a scientist, I'm telling you, the more rational option for you, if you don't want to be a Christian, I understand we can talk about that. But the more rational argument for you is not atheism, it is deism or theism. Let's start there and have that conversation because it's just very hard to grasp the idea to make the state so irrational. It can be and I don't that doesn't mean everyone who's an atheist is irrational. Right, right. Especially by the modern standard where they say, I just need more evidence and we'll unpack that. Or by the time you're listening to this, maybe we have unpacked it. I don't know exactly that's gonna play out. But we will be unpacking that argument in the near future of that. I've got a really good quote, Anthony Flew, who was in really he was an outspoken atheist. He wrote a bunch of textbooks, right? Yeah, he wrote the book Atheistic Humanism. Yes. I mean, he was around at Oxford like during CS Lewis, he was part of the club that Lewis, he was really, really smart. He did debates against Christians and things like that. But eventually over the years, he really was looking at and he admits he wrote a book eventually called There Is a God. And he just said, I had to when I finally follow the evidence wherever it led, but his big can convince her was DNA that it just had, you know, when I said bear earlier, that may be Dr. Bear may be different. I may have been thinking Flew. Oh, I don't know. Keep going. But he said DNA has shown by the almost unbelievably, unbelievable complexity of the arrangements, which are needed to produce life that intelligence must have been involved. And he just admitted it's, he said, it's become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism. So what's interesting for him is at the age of 86, I think he was 81, sorry, 81, he became a theist at least he admitted that he believed in, right in there being a God. But his what led him to that conclusion was looking at science. He was looking at that the DNA evidence and it just seemed irrational because DNA what's so interesting, and this is why I bring it up because it's related to the theological argument, it's information. It's not just matter. In other words, you could open a book and you could explain the chemicals that make up the ink on that page, but it doesn't explain the information in the book. Right. That's something that's different. Right. So you could explain, you know, physical things, but the DNA is the blueprint and where did the blueprint come from? Right. It's a, we use it in language terms, it's words and letters and volumes of stuff. So anyways, that's a good argument. Yeah, both those. And I would encourage people to look up the moral argument is another excellent one. Dr. Craig does that. Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis unpacks that first chapter. And, and then another common one is the, is the ontological argument. I know I have the, I say that I think I have these unpacked on my page of basic answer, but, and the ontological argument, the people for whom the ontological argument were like is convincing. They're super usually super convinced by it. And that's the basic principle of very simple principle. I must say this super, this is a major argument, but is that God by definition would be the thing, the ultimate thing. And it is more ultimate to exist than not exist. And therefore God must exist. It is a totally, totally logical external human experience. And both the arguments you just heard the cosmological and the teleological are posterior arguments, meaning they include human experience. According to some philosophers, an a priori argument, meaning one without any human experience would be the most perfect argument. You could do it, but it doesn't require experience because our experience is not as trustworthy. And the only sound, a priori argument for the existence of God is the ontological, which means by the nature of God's own nature, he must exist. And it's a, it's a great one. And some people, especially if you're more philosophically minded, some people, they hear that one and they're like done. Yeah. Wow. I mean, there's no way for God not to exist based on the fact that we're talking about. It means he must like it's a pretty strong argument. Yeah. Someday, maybe on this podcast, we'll talk about, I actually think the nature of marriage is proof of a designer. So I would fall under a design argument or the teleological argument, but that's a whole other, that's a whole other conversation for another day. That's awesome. But both of these, you know, when I have my doubts or my questions or my concerns, I revisit some of these and even sometimes revisit some of the arguments against them. And, and they just feel so pale and weak compared to the strength of these arguments that those are helpful to me. Now, again, these aren't about causing someone to become a Christian. Yeah. This is simply just you, there is rational to believe that there is a God, there is a creator, there is a designer. Then we can discuss other things from top of that. And we will, and we will, we will. So thank you so much for listening. Yeah.
