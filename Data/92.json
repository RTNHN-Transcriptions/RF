We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, and in studio are my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. Guys, it's good to be back. And I'm excited because we're kind of focusing on what's next in this next section or segment or series of the podcast. And so can I throw it over to you, Chris? Yeah. I think people will realize that this is kind of a natural next step. And we're trying to make this as organic as possible as far as like, okay, what are we thinking about dealing with? And what is our audience probably finding beneficial out of what we're able to produce? And so yeah, I'll throw it over to you, Chris, to kind of kickstart. Well, it's been intriguing. And you know, for us, this has been a learning process as well. But, you know, our essential, our original premise that it isn't deconstruction that is the problem. It's the failure to reconstruct or to build from what's torn down. That really our premise is that, you know, deconstruction of faith is a constant ongoing kind of process that we're always kind of refurbishing and refocusing and rehabbing and all the re's repenting. So and I think that's healthy and good. And I just we felt like there wasn't there wasn't much out there to kind of guide the process of reconstruction. There was a lot to deconstruct and a lot opposing deconstruction, but not a lot to say, okay, so here's how do you reengage in front of the rework? So I think one of the conversations you know, last last season, when we're when we've been talking with different people, and these will all read another reword recapitulate. You can't stop now. Thank you for remarking on that. The having the, you know, our kind of our goal was people who have deconstructed or nearly deconstructed or should have for lack of a term should have deconstructed or I don't know, who would be predicted that they would and then didn't. And so that was kind of our last conversation have series, you know, with Zach and Mark and Dan and I don't remember all who a lot of people and so and so just hearing like, what kept them from as they deconstructed, not walking or what not staying there. And so we even looked at our stories and how we've engaged with that. Well, I think, you know, a natural next step, I think for us is to talk with people either directly or indirectly with people who have deconstructed and are still there. That that, you know, Lord willing, of course, our hope if they're, you know, to the degree that there are people that we love, and hopefully we love everybody, at least some degree, but is that our hope is that they would not stay there. And unapologetically, that would be our desire. But at the same time, we want to learn and gain access and insight into what might, what are the patterns there? So, you know, we've discovered certain patterns already. And then what is it that allows people to continue the conversation to not end the conversation at deconstruction? Yeah. And I think also model how to have good conversations, because I think we talked at one point about if we are constantly talking about people who deconstruct from a third person or, you know, like an outside view, and we never actually engage with them in conversation or are encouraging people to have good conversations, but we never model that. That's like good borderline hypocritical at some level. And so we want to make sure that we are, we are having good conversations and even demonstrating and learning and growing for ourselves of how to have good conversations with those that we still disagree with. Right. Because I think the world really needs that. The world really needs to learn how to have conversations with people who disagree and walk away still caring about each other. Yes. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And I feel like we're people who share our worldview are uniquely capable of doing that simply because we what we believe about people, right? You know, that we were created in the image of God and stuff like that. And so, yeah, we don't know how this is, you know, how exactly this is going to play out. You know, we don't know this is going to be scripted at all. And so it's like, because we've talked about, okay, you know, we have people in mind that we could talk to. We don't, but it's also like, who's going to be willing to come and talk to us? And then is that going to be beneficial for relationship in the future? So trying to tow that line. So, you know, we also talked about, and Chris, I think said it earlier, like, okay, you know, are we, so I'm just diving into what else, you know, what Chris had said of like, maybe it's, you know, we're hopeful to have conversations in person. It may also look like books or documentaries or blog posts or articles or something like that as well. Yeah, like engaging with people's stories. Exactly. However, that is accessible. Right. Yeah, that's, that's huge. It's actually, there'd be a great, I mean, this would be a moment of invitation. Like if you, if you know of someone, a moment of invitation. Wow. What a Jesus way to say that. Yeah. We would say, if you know of someone who you think might be a good person to have that conversation, obviously we'd need to kind of evaluate that. Right. But even, even if there's a book or an article or a podcast that's challenged your faith, especially if it's left you with a sense of unease, of discontent or disappointment, that you're like, I don't know what to do with this, then maybe we can engage with it. Yeah. And this is going to require a little more work from us than normal. I think we may have to do a little more work in between studying up on some of these or reading them. But yeah, I think that'd be fascinating to do. Yeah, I'm excited. I think it's going to be a really neat season. And yeah, we would love for people to communicate with us though, about those articles or YouTube videos or celebrities that they follow, whatever it is, like on, on whatever level. Yeah. Yeah. And I think the, the other thing, cause I was, I was talking to a guy at a coffee shop not that long ago. And he was, you know, really gregarious, easy to talk to. And he, he asked, you know, what I did for a living. And I told him that I worked at a church. And so he, he just said he had had this fascination with theology and, and religion and stuff like that. And so I was like, man, you, and you know, after talking to him for probably 15 minutes, it was like a dude, I don't know if he'd be interested, but we have this podcast where we talk to people and it's like our conversation kind of changed. And so I think what, and I think we, we did, we did this, you know, or we have done this in the past. Well, I would say, but also, you know, considering, you know, going all the way back to David Smalley, we're, we're not bringing people on the podcast to put them on blast or to like try to convince them on, on a medium of like, Hey, yes, we're putting you here. You're wrong. We're right. Yeah. And, and now, you know, we're, we're trying to be antagonistic to you and prove our point. And so I don't, that's a good, that's a good, I mean, I think that's good for you to kind of set the expectations that way is you may be listening to us interviewing somebody and, and you may hear them say something and you're thinking, Oh, I know, you know, Brin or Chris or Colson would, I mean, that was like a, you know, a wicked 12 foot arc that they just threw up there. Surely they're going to hit that out of the park and really nail them and show them where they're wrong. And so don't be frustrated if we don't do that. That's, that's, we're not debating these people. We're interviewing them. We want to understand their perspective. Yes. We're going to ask questions, you know, to, for clarification and that kind of stuff. And that will hopefully create some conversation. But, but, um, yeah, this is not a debate. This is not going to become a debate podcast. Don't, if that stresses you out, don't worry. We're not doing that. If it stresses you out that we're not going to be debating the person, well, I'm sorry, but we're not going to be debating the person. And, and I also think, you know, because we've done this historically, when we have somebody, we either debrief that one interview or we debrief them at length, you know, with other, with other ones. And so I think there's also something to be said, like if there's something that I don't know triggered you or something from, and I'm talking to you listener right now, if there's something that was like, you know, this was really hard for me to listen to or whatever, like I can't guarantee that we'd talk about that, but it, that might help kind of steer our, um, our conversation in that followup, you know, because one, it's probably something that we are already thinking about, but if it's not, it could be like, okay, great. Somebody's, somebody really values kind of this perspective or whatever. So I don't know. I don't know what y'all think of that. It's like, if you, we want to engage with you listener, and I know that you have a busy life, whatever you're doing, but the more feedback that we can get from you, um, and what you're thinking is, is really beneficial to us because we want to meet you where you are and handle those questions and, and the dialogue with you. And so, yeah. And I think this is helpful also because I've listened to podcasts before where the goal is to hear someone's story. And if you don't know that going in, you think that by listening and asking questions, the host is agreeing with them. And it's easy. And I've seen a lot of feedback on podcasts like that, where it's like, how could you, I didn't think you, whatever. And, and I think if the goal, if you know, the goal is to listen and ask questions and learn, then you'll know that our silence or just listening doesn't necessarily mean that we're in agreement with the person, but we just want to be kind and listen and learn. And, and I think part of our Christian ethic also is that regardless of, like you said, everyone's made an image of God and we're called to love everyone. But I think also in humility, we can admit like, just because we disagree with others doesn't mean we don't have things to learn from them. I think that's valuable to admit as well. We're not interviewing people assuming that we have all the answers and that we're just, you know, patronizing them and listening. And we have nothing to learn. So yeah, that's another excellent point. Yeah. That's, that's a big deal. And that's not, yeah. I appreciate y'all pointing that out because that could have been easy for someone to, did they misunderstood and thought this was a debate. And we, we will, it's been our practice no matter who it's been to debrief the conversation afterwards. And as we try to be super respectful, that's always hard, you know, and, and we did that with, uh, Smalley from the beginning, when we, anytime we have some interview, we talk a little bit about, you know, what we, what our experiences were. So, and, and, and I think, I mean, I think the people who we, who we do invite on will either know that about our situation, that we do debrief things later. Um, but so, but it would be, it would be greatly helpful if you listened to a podcast, to one of our discussions and there's something that someone says, especially if it's one of our guests, but even if it's one of us and you think, man, I would love to see that unpacked more. I want to get more about that. Yeah. Definitely send that in as an email so we can discuss that. Yeah. I think that'd be really valuable. That's great. Or I mean, I've even had people who are close to me to like text me. We're not going to put our cell phone numbers on the, the show page, but if you have it, if you have, if you already have it, you can text us, but anyone can email us. Yeah. Anyone can email. That's right. Okay. We would love to get it. We really would. We really would. I think this is, this is key. And I think one is the learning process I think is going to be important for us. I have, I wasn't coming into this podcast whenever it was a year or two ago, and we started thinking, oh, this will be a great learning experience for me as far as understanding what creates deconstruction, what engages it, what all that kind of stuff. But it has certainly been that right. And that's been really, that's been super valuable. So we would love that conversation. Oh, and then that was the other thing. And we haven't decided on this exactly, but maybe having some sort of like standard questions or something that we would ask our, ask our interviewers or interviewees. You know what I mean? So if listeners have a specific question that they're like, this would be interesting to hear from every guest. Yeah. They can send in an idea. So yeah. So if you think of something that's like, I always value when I watch, you know, hot ones or something else, you know, or something like that, I really like when they ask this question or something. Again, we'd love to hear from you. Yeah, that'd be great. For sure. Super. Okay. I think that kind of covers it for, yeah. So be looking for that over the next little bit and help us out if you can with ideas, connections, articles, people, whatever. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
