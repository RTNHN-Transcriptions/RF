We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined as always by my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. And guys, today we are going to tackle a listener question that we got, and then move into kind of a topical discussion because of that. And so can I go ahead and just read out the question, and then I'll probably throw it over to you guys and we can kind of give context, define terms, and jump into the conversation as it happens. Is that cool? Okay, so our listener, we're not going to say any names, but I'm first of all just really grateful for such an honest and raw question. And the question says, I have a question for the podcast. And it's where it says, God does not love those who identify as something they are biologically not. And those who love the same sex? It's been a question I've had for years. So I think from that, what I get is, does God not love those who identify as something they are biologically not? And does God love those who love the same sex? And so I know we've talked about gender, we've talked about sexuality in the past. And I think as our listeners, depending on where they join in our conversation, they may not know that we have older episodes, but then they also might listen and have additional questions. And I know, Bryn, you're going to be speaking to students in our area, actually at our church soon, about a similar topic. And so can I throw it over to you just for some initial insight as you're hearing a question like this and kind of where your brain goes, and then we can go from there. Yeah, sure. And then I'll throw it to you, Chris, for your definitions, because I think those are really helpful if you don't mind. Yeah, I'm happy to talk about sex and gender. But yeah, this is a conversation that I think is really important to dig into wherever you fall on the beliefs of it, for a number of reasons. One of my favorite authors on this, his name is Sam Albury, and he writes really readable, digestible books that are really kind and just kind of unpack a lot of these things. But one of the things that he says a lot is that God cares about these issues because he cares about you, and God cares about your body and who you love and what you do with your body because he cares about you. And I think that is like a framework that I love to start with, because I think we'll unpack the nuance of a lot of this. And this is a complex question. I think when people treat it like it's not complex, they're doing a disservice to people who wrestle with these questions and conversations. And so yeah, just admitting this is complex, but also I think it's important to dig into them because God cares about you and God cares about what you're wrestling with. Even if you are wrestling with or feeling something or believing something that is different than he's laid out in scripture, he still cares about you as a person and still loves you as a person. And we can go through some of the verses that talk about that. But I think, yeah, I think that's the first reason it's important to dig into this is just to understand that these matter. And then also, I think if whether or not you are someone who personally struggles with this question or this topic, we all are living in 2024. And this is a really common question and a really common issue. And so I think for us to follow Jesus, we have to know what he thinks and what he says about it so that we can talk to others about it in a really healthy way. And I think the second thing that I think of is one thing that we have to really avoid is there's a lot of conversation out there about what Christians think or what God thinks. And it's people putting words into God's mouth. So instead of going to scripture and saying like, okay, what does God actually believe about people who are gay or people who are transgender? There are just a lot of people who say, well, God hates this or God hates that. And sometimes it's Christians like putting words into God's mouth. And that's not that are not accurate and not helpful. And so we have to go back to scripture and say like, okay, let's not put words in God's mouth that he hasn't said. Let's see what he actually says about these things. So I don't know any any additional additional initial thoughts. Well, that was my I mean, the first thing when I heard the question that I started doing was trying to find any passage that could even with the worst possible motives indicate that God hates gay people or transgender or or any population like that. And I'm still looking I my instinct is that there is no such verse. There is no such passage. Certainly I would have seen it before. But maybe not maybe I missed it somehow. But I don't I can't imagine. I'm looking right now, but I'm not finding anything. You know, I'm finding a few passages that list things that God hates like in the Book of Proverbs. But I mean, my first thing is that's the first question of us having a conversation with this questioner would be, can you tell me what passage in the Bible you're talking about that references that God hates gay people or God hates because because I just don't think it's there. And and the commentaries I'm looking at so far have said the same thing. There is no such verse. There's no such passage. Now, there are plenty of passes to talk about God hating sin. The Hebrew word there is saunei for God hating something like the probably the and by best known, I mean probably not many people know about it. But the probably the best known is going to be in Proverbs 6 16. And I may be getting too far ahead. You know, am I jumping too far? I don't think so. Okay, so there are six things the Lord hates seven that are an abomination to him. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies and one who sows discord among brothers. So that's like, one, I don't I don't think that this that this word hatred, so the it's intriguing the Hebrew word for hatred, Hebrew is very colorful language is the word that we use for like sticker burrs. And so because everybody hates them, it's like, no one loves them. Like it's like you step on one, you're like, Oh my gosh, I hate these things. Or when they get tangled up in your shoelaces, you're like, Oh, I hate these things. That's that's the idea of hatred here. It isn't this, I don't know that we have this, maybe we have a wrong idea, like this sophisticated, intentional, malicious, strategic desire to destroy something that that I think sometimes we use with hatred. And maybe there's that's a possibility. It mostly means avoid, or maybe reject or this is something I would just, I just would just assume, yeah, it's not here. And so do you think it's easy to assign the meat, something means hatred when if you're identifying like this is this is what I believe is very crucial about my identity. Yeah. And so if it if that's not being affirmed in the Bible, it okay, so but I know I know that conversation. So that's what I'm curious. We'll get there. I think is I'm jumping the gun here, then maybe but I think that's part of the question is, if by hatred, do you mean God calls it sin? Yeah, or God labels it as an abomination, the behavior. Here's what's wild. Even in that list, it isn't the person who God is hating. It is some aspect of the person or the person's decisions that he hates. So even in the passage that probably is the most directly like, Oh, no, no, God hates this stuff. Well, those are behaviors of people, not it's still not the person. And again, you know, I just I just feel like when someone asks the question, or someone gets told, this is one thing, my fear is she's been told this by someone that God hates gay people, or God hates trans genders, or God hates something like that. And like, one, anytime you hear something, one, gosh, I mean, she's doing exactly where I think she's checking. So, you know, good job on on checking, like, does the Bible say this? Is this here, like, so reaching out to trustworthy people and digging and doing the research discover first is the claim an accurate claim. And I think that's always a good idea. Totally. Now, I think you're making a very good point, though, Colson, which is it's easy to feel hated when someone doesn't love something we love. When someone doesn't approve of something that we love, or approve of something that we want, and that can feel like rejection. So that if I go, you know, to my mom, when I'm an eight year old, I'm like here, Legos, I love Legos, don't you love Legos? And she's like, I don't really like Legos that much, honestly. And that's going to feel personal, probably to an eight year old. If I go to my wife and say, Hey, in fact, we wrestle with this, my wife doesn't like to travel, and I do like to travel. And so there are times I'm like, Hey, I've got this opportunity to go travel, would you like to go with me? And she's like, No, not really. And it's easy for that to feel like a rejection of me. But it's not if I was home, she'd be happy to be with me. It's not, it's not the me that's the problem. It's the travel that she doesn't like. And I can so I can see that I think that's a good point is that we need to be aware of that question maybe. And we have had quite a few we have had some pretty in depth conversations about that on the podcast in the past. I do believe God labels homosexual behavior as sin. I'm not as clear on how God labels transgender choices. I don't think that's as obvious biblically. But as far as homosexual behavior, I do think that's labeled sin. But again, we we spend some time unpacking that I don't I don't know. Maybe I feel like we've kind of jumped towards some of the end conversations here. What what else do we need to unpack on our way to getting there? Well, I think I think it's helpful at some point to go through like your definitions of sex and gender and like kind of separate those two so that we can talk about talk about that. But I think yeah, how many if we unpack a little bit about the identity conversation, and how our identity is different as Christians, maybe that's a good next step. Because I think that's a part of this conversation. Because I think it's also we're what we're also saying is just like followers of Jesus can struggle with really anything. I mean, I think that's also a good, a good thing to I think, unpack in these same things is we're saying a struggle with a behavior. If you are a follower of Jesus, and you are, and you are attracted to the same sex, right? That is not doesn't mean that God doesn't love you any less, right? Or and that that's not legitimate. Does that make sense? Am I saying that correctly? I think so. Yeah, go ahead, Chris. Well, I was gonna say I think. No, let's do it because I'm not sure I was like, if you're if you're if you're like, I'm a Christian, and I am struggling with what what we would say the Bible talks about as sin, or not sorry, not struggling with sin, but struggling with the temptation to have like, you know, I really am attracted to the same sex. And I'm struggling with that, because it's like, this feels like such a part of me. And I am. Yeah, and but I want to live for the Lord. And so I don't know. It's like hard to kind of bring that dissonance together, right? You know, or the bridge those things together. And maybe I'm making too much of this. And I'm, and maybe we need to be talking about something more at the foundational level. No, I think, but I think that could also kind of go hand in hand with that. I think we should start with defining the terms. Well, those terms, and that I think you are working towards it. I think that's what we're doing here is kind of working to define those terms so that if we say, before you say that, please do I think just one more foundational piece, because we're talking about like, God's heart towards people first. Yeah. So there's a whole conversation about like, what does God think about homosexuality? What does he you know, what does it mean to be man or woman? And I think those are important conversations, but they are, like I said, they are deep and complex. But I think if you go back to like the heart of Jesus, when it comes to all these questions of like, if you look at the life of Jesus and how he interacted with other people, even people that he disagreed with. So at the end of the day, even if, you know, we had time to lay out all of and we'll lay out some of it, but like, even if we had time to go through all of it. And at the end of the day, someone said, like, I still disagree with part of this or all of it, or I'm still wrestling with this. At the end of the day, God's heart towards you is still like care and love, right? Yeah, he does call you to certain things as like, if you follow him, he is very open about what he calls you to when it comes to like sin and life. But if you look at how Jesus interacted with people in the New Testament, like people that, you know, other religious people viewed as enemies, people who lived nothing like Jesus, people who didn't agree with Jesus, people who were doing things with their body that he was saying, Hey, this is not my best for you. He still loved them and saw them and met them where they were. So like, if you look at the woman at the well, she was in a lot of, um, you know, she was making a lot of sexual choices that, that Jesus was calling her out of and saying, Hey, this is not my plan. I, he was, he wasn't shying away from the fact that some of that was sin, but he saw her as she was saw her story, what she struggled with and still loved her as a person. And I think that's the piece that we have to have is the foundation of like, okay, we can unpack what Jesus says about all of this. But if you don't start with who Jesus is, then a lot of that is going to feel a lot harsher and is going to feel like Colson was saying of like, maybe more hatred than, um, you know, then if we keep the heart of Jesus in mind of like, he cares about you and your specific story, um, and what's going on with you, even if at the end of the day, there's like disagreement on, you know, he calls something sin and you're not convinced yet. Does that make sense? And, and by the way, the reason that he's calling things sin, I'm convinced is always because he knows us better than we know ourselves. And so when we want something that he calls sin, um, he is, he is showing more at that moment, true love for us, um, than we are showing for ourselves. And, and again, that's going to sound really like that's difficult for someone who has a real serious desire in their heart, um, that they want to engage in, but that is not that the Bible calls sin. And I don't always even understand, I don't pretend to understand how or why something is better. Um, sometimes something is better because it's harder or more difficult. Those are, there's so many things that are potentially on the table there. But, um, what I would tell you is that's a, I think God, even when God tells, calls something sin, it is still founded in love. Um, even if we disagree that it is at some level, somehow it is like our parents taking us to the doctor to get a vaccine. It doesn't seem like love to us in the moment, um, but it is love. So anyway, I just, I just think there's, so I would say that that's so true. What you've said is that even, even when we disagree with him, or even when we're not happy with, you know, whatever proclamation he has there, um, it is, it is true that it is still founded in love. And I really do believe that. And I think the narrative that a lot of us end up believing because we hear it a lot is if someone disagrees with me or my decisions, that means they hate me. Or don't, that means they don't love me. That's not a Christian narrative. That is a narrative from the world. And we have to be careful not to adopt that because what happens is when the world tells us, Oh, if someone disagrees with you, if they say that something that you're doing is wrong, that means that they don't love you or accept you that that's a narrative from the world. And that's right. Which can be easy. I feel like, I don't, I don't know. I think it's also important exactly with what you're saying, Brian, because I think it's like, just because, um, just because I'm a heterosexual male does not mean that now I'm not subject to what God calls Yeah, says he's not, you know, that he, that is not best for me. And it certainly doesn't mean that God loves you more or anything like that, that that's you being heterosexual or male or Christian, even Christian doesn't mean God loves you more than he does someone who is, and you're right. It also doesn't somehow excuse you. There are still temptations that you have, that you would love to for God to change his mind on. Right. But, but he's not going to change his mind, apparently for us and what we desire. So yeah, I would say that is a, that's an important understanding too. Um, so yeah, but back to the definitions. Yeah. So what we've talked about, I, this is, this is me and I don't represent anyone but me here. Um, although obviously I think I'm right. Yeah. And all humility about this one, the, um, uh, that, that we do what, what sex is, um, when we say sex, um, it is a, um, you were talking about the, the genetic stance like you either XX or XY in a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the time it is, um, XXY. Um, but then it's like, that's, that's, that does happen, but it's, uh, you've extremely rare and, and it is that, but that is still, it's, that is a scientific truth that we can say, okay, there are some people born with this and that is a complication and that can be dealt with. And it has been for forever. I mean, the human race has always been dealing with that. Um, and so that's, that's, that's one piece and intersex or the people who have the XXY, um, that's a, it creates its own difficulties and we can come alongside those people and should be very intentionally coming alongside people who face that and try to figure out how to be a blessing to them anyway. So that's one definition is that's, that's what I think is meant by sex male or female. It's the way you're born. It's the way your genetics, um, define your male or female-ness XX or XY. So that's that gender is the socio-cultural rules by which you let people know which sex you are without them having to check. Um, that that's its purpose. That's the purpose of gender is to, is it, you know, every culture needs ways of knowing what your sex is. And so I use some examples teaching some students the other day, like the police need to know how hard to hit you. Uh-huh. And if they don't know, they're going to hit you as though you're a male. And I know that there have been people injured that way. Women who were presenting themselves as male who then get tackled by a policeman and get readily badly hurt. Um, or, um, women who lose babies when they go to the ER because they don't tell the doctor that they are female. Um, they are presenting as a male and they don't tell the doctor that they're female. And then the doctor does a scan or a treatment that kills the baby they're carrying because they didn't know that that was a female. Um, and so there are, those are issues. Like there are reasons in our culture, why it's important for us to know which sex are you and for this protection. Yeah. Some is safety, some is different things. And some of it is, um, so that, you know, yeah, so that people can know who to be pursuing and who to not be pursuing, um, when it comes to relationships and that kind of stuff, there's, there's no doubt that parts of this are just cultural and parts of it are just issues of attraction. Um, but there are other pieces of it as well that are, that are there. And I think if the Bible speaks to that and it kind of does, um, it's speaking of it in terms of like, almost like kindness or telling the truth is how it's treated is that if you are a male, it should be, you should be able to tell. Yeah. Yeah. And if the Bible speaks to it at all, it's under those terms a male should look enough male that people can tell your male and a female should look enough female. But honestly, that's not some hard line rule. Huh? There's, that's not what people, some people are very, I don't know, passionate about, you know, if you're, it's kind of that it's, it's, it ends up being an erroneous, I believe argument that, well, God made you this way. And so that just means nothing should ever be questioned about that or changed about that. And the problem is that was the same argument used years for like, well, if God wanted you to have your rings, he'd have put holes in your ears or God wanted you to fly. He'd have given you wings or, and I think any argument that backs into that is, is the undangerous ground. Totally. Um, and so what, what is that? I think, I think there's something to it. I think it's a good conversation to have. Um, my conversations about presentation of sex and gender end up having more to do with my profession as a therapist than they do with my theology a lot of times. Um, but anyway, those, I think are the correct definitions. So you can be, so one is the description of male or female. You are male or you are female. And with the exception of the rare chance that is a decided by your genetics, then you can be, we would believe, well, like on that, before you move on, go ahead. We would biblically believe that, that that was chosen by God because, you know, in Genesis one, it says he made them male and female. And then, you know, you have verses like Psalm 139 that says he like intricately wove you together. Like, you know, he like chose, you know, that's all true. Genetic factors of you. Yes. However, you have to be careful because you wouldn't want to say, and changing any of those things is necessarily somehow sin because a kid who was born deaf, we would not say it's wrong. We wouldn't say, well, that's how God made them. Yeah. So that's their genetics. And so it's wrong for us to do surgery to allow the behavior. Right. Her defects. Yes. Whatever. That's okay. So we just have to be aware. Yes. I believe they're, they got created fundamentally only two sexes, male and female. And then when you have someone who has that intersex condition, which is super rare, the vast majority of time, they are clearly male and their best, the best choices to live that way. But that can be treated as a case by case, just like someone who's born with a club foot or with something else wrong. Yeah. From a genetic perspective. Because the other piece of like Christian theology is that yes, we were made intentionally, but also we're broken by sin, meaning like all different parts of our body are affected by that. Not just, you know, our desires, but also physically affected. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. Okay. So that's a good, I think that's understanding. And we, and so when we say, um, you know, how you present gender, what we then mean is not male or female, but masculine or feminine. Um, and that's the, that's that question and people can be more or less masculine or feminine. And every culture is a little bit different as to what is masculine and what is feminine. And so that's part of it too, is we, we have to be aware that there's a cultural aspect to it. Um, we have to be aware that there is a, um, there are choices to be made. And, and I mean, it's, especially in our culture, um, is for women, especially what is considered or acceptably feminine is huge. Um, clothing wise, for example, or presentation wise is there's a lot of options that a woman can choose and still be feminine. Um, but I still could say, you know, I could say to Bren, Hey, Brian, I want you to, you know, we're going to this certain event. Let's say her husband said, we're going to go out on a date and I want you to go full feminine. Like I want you to just, just go with the full package when it comes to being as feminine as you possibly can be. She would know what that meant. Um, now that's a separate conversation, what she would do, but that's not, that's not what I was. But she would, she would know like, if I'm going to do that, like if I'm going to, if I decide I do want to do that, exactly. Like who are you and what have you done with my husband? That's what you would say. But the, um, uh, but if he did, she would probably not show up in, you know, sweat pants and Crocs like, um, because she would, although like she normally, like she normally does exactly. And we all know she's a woman because that's, that's within. Then we had the Scott Fest this last weekend in which there was a whole lot of very masculine males walking around in skirts, which you would normally go like, Oh, what's going on here? But no one had any questions about that because culturally it was appropriate for men to wear a kilt at a Scottish event, um, because of the cultural thing. So there is a cultural piece to it and we have to be aware of that. And it changes throughout time. What is masculine? What is feminine changes throughout time. Um, and so I think there's a lot of different complications to that. And I think it's healthy that we can have those complications and conversations. I do think we face a potential issue and people are intentionally, um, being, uh, I don't know if dishonest is the word they would use, but, but it expressing themselves as a gender, which is meant to hide which sex they are. Uh-huh. And, and I think that's something that biblically we might wrestle with. And I think we would have to wrestle with, but I, but all of this to say it's not clearly defined as sin that isn't. And it's not ever are people who are even making those choices described as being hated by God. Right. Right. And in my mind, that still comes back to a key like, and therefore should not, by the way, therefore should not be hated by God's people. Right. And they should not be hated by Christians. That's not going to work. I've done a very poor job of that. Yes. And again, I can even understand how someone listening to our conversation might go like, but that feels kind of like why do we, why is it that, um, that the church has done such a poor job? Is it because of a similar thing we've been talking about recently of like, we tend to just always want to go back to or reinvigorate this honor shame culture. And so if there's an, an option to do that in our flesh, like, cause nowadays it's like, I feel like in at least people who are wanting to really engage with scripture biblically or sorry, wanting to engage with Christianity biblically, which I feel like is a funny thing to say because of it's like, why wouldn't you? But it's like, why, why is the, why, why have we struggled so much with treating people who struggle with homosexuality or identify as homosexuals? Why has the church gotten such a stigma? Why has that been hard for us? I mean, yeah, I would, I've got a couple as well immediate that I think, I think one is that I think Christians are sometimes more concerned about how they feel about a behavior than, than about how God feels about a behavior where God would say about that behavior. And so I think there is to some degree, and you know, I was going to say maybe it's natural. I don't know exactly, but you know, there's, there is, it costs you something when your child, is engaging in certain sinful behaviors or making certain sinful choices. Yeah. That's a, you know, maybe that's part of it is that they're like, well, does this mean I'm not going to get to have grandkids or, or, or is it just the things that seem the most extreme to us or the most outside of the norm to us must somehow because they feel that way to us must somehow feel that way to God. I don't know the answer to the question of why in many cases Christians do, like Christians do behave more hateful or inappropriate towards certain sins than others. I don't know the answer to that question. I would only have guesses. Yeah. What are your thoughts? I mean, why we get their reputation for it. We can come back to that in a second. Right. Right. Well, yeah, I mean, I, that was one of my thoughts is just like, I think Christians let feelings take over and it's like any sin that we personally don't struggle with, we are quick to judge and kind of like treat with disgust. So, and I feel like part of that is like pride. Part of that is just like a brokenness in us, but it's, it's like wanting to build ourselves up by feeling better about ourselves and our specific sins. Yeah. And yeah, I think some of it is, is a feeling of like, you know, if I feel disgust towards a certain sin or behavior, like it's easy for me to lash out. I think the other thing is it's a lot harder to just kind of hear people's stories and, and treat these like they're, they're nuanced and complex instead of just being like, well, I'm just going to write this off. I'm not going to interact with anyone. Right. Actually, this is their story. Right. Because that takes a lot more compassion and, and is a lot harder in some ways. Yeah. And I think Christians have done a really poor job of just being like, Hey, I, I'm actually going to get to know someone who this is their struggle and hear their story. And I think sometimes Christians, we've talked about this before, but I'm sure I think sometimes Christians, they get confused about what standing for truth is. And so even Christians who are, who mean well, they think that standing for truth means like something that, that God never said, meaning like, I never associate with people like this, or I'm going to somehow just call it out and never hear people's stories. If I let them tell their story or what they're struggling with, then somehow I'm not standing for truth. And it's like, no, none of that is, you know, they've, they've built up what it means to stand for truth into something that is reactive instead of more in line with the heart of Jesus and what Jesus even engaged with people. Right. And it's like, yeah, that, that is a lot harder in some situations just to be like, wow, like you identify as transgender. Tell me your story. Like what, um, what is your experience been? How did this happen? You know, how did you get to this place where, you know, and like, it's like, I don't, it's not, um, it's not denying truth to sit there and listen to someone. Right. And yet sometimes Christians think that for some reason. Um, I don't know, but anyway, those are just a couple of thoughts. I might have kind of gone all over it. No, that's okay. I think, I think that's great. I think we're just, we're trying to kind of engage with this, this conversation. Well, um, I do think part of how Christians have gotten their reputation for picking on certain things, um, does have a lot to do with though. Also the kind of what we would call the sexual revolution. Um, and, and I think that's what's happened with the sexual revolution, which started a long, long time ago, um, is that, is that we, we have this, um, uh, tendency. So what happens is, and really it started during the romantic era, which was a couple of hundred years ago, is that you start getting these, okay, the way we've always, the way that the sexual revolution, the messages, the way we've always said this is wrong, the way you've always done this is wrong. It's a revolution. It's overthrowing something. And so, you know, what you believe, what the world has always taught about love is wrong. Love should be romantic, not just a choice. Well, that was the push in the romantic era. And Christians came along and said, no, no, that's wrong. And the immediate response of the world was, why are you always talking about this? And, and the Christian view was, we didn't bring this up. We didn't change. We've had the same view on this for 2000 years. You brought it up, not us. You brought it up and you started revolting against this. And when we try to defend ourselves, the response or defend our view, not ourselves, but defend the view, the response is, well, you're always talking about this. Well, that's the, and so if you go through, I mean, romantic love, the role of arranged marriages, feminism, divorce, sex education, pornography is free speech, polygamy, birth control, no-fault divorce, sex education, sex before marriage, cohabitation, single parent families, no-fault divorce, abortion, feminism, toxic masculinity, homosexuality, same sex marriages, age of consent, polyamory, like these are each steps along the way. And what happens is whichever one is the gun to the microscope at the moment, when this movement, and by the way, sometimes the movement has been right. The Christianity has been on the unbiblical perspective has had an unbiblical perspective on this. That certainly has been the case. But I think that's a, that's that though that happens, what happens is you create that pattern over and over again, which is, okay, marriage is between a man and a woman, the revolution finally reaches the point of saying, no, it's not. So that's been the Judeo-Christian view for, I don't know, four or five thousand years. And no, nope, and anyone, it's a right given by the government protected by law, and anyone can be married. It's not between a man and a woman. And when the Christian or Jewish response is, no, that's wrong. What we've already always taught is the right answer. And then the feedback is, why are you always talking about this? You hate people. And so I think that's the pattern over the revolution. Now, what happens very often is Christians sometimes then get personally defensive or begin to take personally these conversations or begin to see people as our enemies or whatever. And that turns us into jerks. And then what the next thing you're doing is you're scared. My child, my friend, my whatever is choosing something that I believe is sin, that I think is bad for them, that I think will harm them and hurt them. And then when that happens and you respond in fear and you make bad choices and bad responses and you say sometimes hateful things, that creates that pattern as well. So I think it's a mixture of all of it. I think sometimes there's an unfair. One of my questions I love to ask when someone says, why do Christians hate certain people or hate certain things, is I just ask, like, I would love to hear about your experiences. Can you tell me about when you've experienced something like that from a Christian or from somebody? And I'm asking that for two reasons. One, if there is such a story, I really would like to know about it. Like, I really think that's a fascinating thing to learn about whatever they're facing with that. And it can be very important to understanding what they're dealing with. And so I would say, you know, that's one of the things I want us to know when we're engaging in that conversation is I want us to know what they've personally faced. Sometimes the response I get is, well, I've not ever been treated that way by a Christian. I've never had anyone treat me hatefully or be mean to me. I just know that it happens and I want to, like, why do Christians hate so much? I'm like, I would love to hear about your story about Christians being hateful. And sometimes that's a thing they faced, but honestly, sometimes it's just something they've never faced. And so then I want to understand where you're getting that message. And this is a great example. Well, you know, in the Bible it says that God hates people like this. And I'm like, I don't, I don't think that it does. I don't think that's there. And I'd love to know where you got that idea. And, or correct me if I'm wrong, if it does say that somewhere, show me where it is. But I've kind of been halfway looking while we've been talking and I have still not found it. I've still not found anything that indicates that. So anyway, my hope that means that it's just not there. And that's unfortunate that you've, that someone's been taught that or told that. Do you think we've answered the question? Like looking back, let's look at the question one more time and see if we think we've answered this question. So the question says, her question is basically where it says God does not love those who identify as something they are biologically not. And those, and also that God does not love those who love the same sex. And so I feel like the answer that we gave to that was God does love those who identify as something they are biologically not. And He does love those who love the same sex. We've talked, we separated the conversation between, okay, this is, there's kind of a behavior side of things. There's, but God, I think the bottom line is we, what I think what we see in scripture is that God loves us. And yes, yeah, He loves you no matter what. This is part of his identity. Yes. Sorry. And so that's, that's kind of what I'm doing. Then we kind of defined some terms and stuff like that throughout this. Is there anything you would add to that though, in response to it? Because I feel like that's, I feel like we did justice to the question. Okay. If that was the whole question, then I think, yeah, we've probably engaged with that well and answered it well. I think the answer is God does, and it may not always feel that way. I feel the same way sometimes. There are times when I feel like God doesn't love me and He certainly doesn't love me the way I want to be loved. And I would, you know, there are times I would love for Him to show love to me in a certain way. And maybe sometimes that's to give me something that I want that He hasn't given me. And maybe, I mean, there's a lot of different potential versions of what that might be. But yeah. And yeah, go ahead. No, you're good. Well, I was just gonna say if for the person that sent in the question or for any of our other listeners, if this sparks questions, like any offshoot questions, like we have done some episodes kind of fleshing some of these other topics out, or we have resources that really unpack them well, because some of these things are, yeah, they are hard, they are complex, some of them. And there are some, we've done resources, and then there's also some resources that we trust that have kind of unpacked the complexities of some of these things, particularly like gender and the conversation about transgender. And so, yeah, if you like want more resources or have a specific question that kind of offshoots from that, just let us know. Because obviously, we're not gonna have time to unpack all the ins and outs of both of those topics here, but could definitely give you resources. That's awesome. That's really good. Just when it comes to, you know, either gay relationships or transgender. So. Do you think, so here's the question I wanted us to kind of wrap up this part of the conversation with is, why is this conversation so connected to deconstruction? What is it that creates a sense of deconstruction for us in this question? Thoughts? I think because so many of these conversations are identity questions and core for the individuals who are asking them. So that's why I mentioned identity at the beginning. But I think when you're either wrestling with something that feels like an identity or you are making decisions about your sexuality or whatever, and then it's becoming an identity for you, not just like a decision or a piece of you. And then Jesus comes along and says like, Hey, I have a lot to say about these things. Then it feels like it feels incompatible. You know, it comes up against my identity and who Christ says that I am and therefore what he requires of me and the identity that I feel like I can't part from and still be myself. I think that's the key is it feels like God or God's people are rejecting something about myself. And I think anytime somebody feels like somebody's rejecting something that's really important to you, especially when it like you said, it feels like an identity level thing like this is me, it feels like me, that that conversation I agree is if somebody if somebody pushes you away, or someone someone challenges or disagrees with the decisions you're making when it feels like more than just behavior. Yeah, that that makes you want to push them away. It makes you want to protect yourself from them. And it's hard to it's hard to engage with the conversation from a but but what if this is actually a better decision for me. And that's hard to have that conversation for any of us. And I think that's true for anybody who loses something key. You know, if I mean, if one of my kids died, or my wife died or something, I think I would have that same type of conversation with God is like, why would you take something from me? That is so core to who I am. And I think I would really have to grieve that not I agree with you. I think that's one of the things that Oh, God, son, I'm linking on his name, the guy who you referenced earlier, Sam Allbury, Allbury. I keep wanting to put an apple in his name. Appleberry, Allberry. And I think it's one of the interesting things about reading his stuff is that in the midst of the wrestling match, he's done, he's able to unpack the grieving piece of it. But no one wants to when you feel rejected, no one wants to when you feel rejected. No one likes to be somewhere where we feel rejected. For sure. And I think what we're saying is it isn't rejection. But we also understand that it does feel like that sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. And that's hard. I think the other piece that we have to really be careful with as Christians is just the whole conversation about our identity, our feelings forming us. And I think, I think one thing that's been helpful to me just doing a lot of reading on a lot of these topics and just listening to people's stories and whatever is going back to the conversation that none of us can trust our feelings, what that looks like for each of us is just different. And so it's not that our feelings aren't real. It's not that they don't impact us significantly, but it's not that they don't impact us significantly, but it's the end of the day. They can't be at the end of the day. They can't be truth for us because our feelings are misleading. And I think that's a piece of this that is really hard when something feels so real or so right. And God says it's not right or it's not best for you. And everything within us feels like that isn't true. I think trusting hard. And I think acknowledging that is helpful, but also like when we're in a culture that's saying your feelings define you, they are making up truth for you. Yeah, that's like a really shaky thing to put a foundation of truth on. But when Jesus comes along and says like, Hey, has kind of a different story and says, Hey, my best for you may really go against the way you feel sometimes that creates a lot of confusion or deconstruction in us to to kind of wrestle with that, I think.
