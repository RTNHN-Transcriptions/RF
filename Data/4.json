We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to Reconstructed Faith. We are continuing on with our definition series, kind of setting the stage, setting the foundation for a lot of the words and the thoughts that we're going to be talking about kind of as building blocks. So we've talked about truth and impact that. So if you haven't listened to that, please take a little while and listen to that. That'll be beneficial as you're listening to our podcasts. But today we're going to be talking about faith and the importance of faith and defining faith correctly. Chris Legg, do you want to start us off this morning? OK, so here's what struck me even as we were talking about this just now struck me is the fact that we're looking to define these terms already says so much about our worldview. The three of us in the room that we that we think words have definitions. That is not necessarily a common teaching. In fact, in in deeply postmodern thought, it's that kind of thing is rejected. There are not fundamental statements. There are no definitions for words. But I always like your example from Alice in Wonderland. Yes, yes. Lewis Carroll in Alice in Wonderland does the essentially mocks. I think I think I've read this beyond just my own opinion, but that that Alice in Wonderland is essentially Lewis Carroll mocking the postmodern perspective on things because it creates a mad land, a land of madness. I mean, everyone's crazy if you do this. But I think it's actually through the looking glass when Alice is talking to Cheshire Cat. Is it the Cheshire Cat? It's not Humpty Dumpty. Oh, it may. I think it's Humpty Dumpty. Wait a second. Give me one second here in the podcast world. Humpty Dumpty. And is this something that we can like, I've got audio. No, no, no, sorry. No, it's just me. Okay. Yeah, it's Humpty Dumpty. Humpty, when I use a word Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less. Now, the problem is Humpty Dumpty and Alice have been trying to have a conversation and he keeps using words that make no sense within the context at all make no sense. And so she confronts him on this. Wait, that word doesn't mean that. And that's when he says when I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean neither more nor less. The question said Alice is whether you can make words mean so many different things. This is the chilling statement because that, okay, can you just are you allowed to do that? The question is, so he's mocking her. So she says the question is whether you can make the words mean so many different things. The question is, says Humpty Dumpty, which is to be the master? That's all. In other words, do I get to tell you what the word means? Or do you tell me what the word means? And it's all going to be dependent upon who's the strongest. And, and that's a worldview shift that right there describes that I use that picture from it's actually one of the sketches in the original copies of through the Looking Glass is of them talking and the the that's the question of a worldview change is when you say, okay, the master just changed. And so our culture, yeah, radical autonomy, it's that's right. Yeah, that they get to say, no, no, that the other worldview gets to now gets to say, No, this is the rule. Now this is the rule and everyone needs to conform to that rule. Well, who says? And the answer is, well, whoever is master does whoever is strongest, whoever can cost you something, whoever. And that's a scary thought. Especially when you've been living under a worldview that with all of its flawed application, like the Judeo Christian worldview, because Christians are flawed and messed up and people with all the flawed application involved in it, it's, it's morality demands tolerance of other views and love of other humans. And so that's part of the Christian worldview is the Judeo Christian worldview is demand all humans are worthy of dignity. What happens if the next worldview is, well, if you go back and listen to the last podcast, the last of you said Chris shared at the very end, that atheist statement about that there's none of this stuff really matters, right? We're just we're just animals that don't have any there's no morality, there's no right wrong, there's no afterlife, there's no meaning to any of it. Well, that's your fundamental worldview statement. That's your foundational statement is we're just slightly more complex wolves. Well, I mean, wolves eat each other. So and they it's that's, it's a dark thought I hate to start off with. But just to recognize the postmodern metaphysic, the postmodern worldview is that that there are not absolute statements. They don't mean anything. If I say, I'm going to define truth to mean this, and someone else will say, well, that's your truth, you just defined your truth. Now let me define my truth in and there's no there's no arbiter to decide which one of us is correct on that. So well, it just means you can't land anywhere or it's going to come down to what he said it's power. It's right who can who can dominate the other person and make them believe that worldview. Watch, I'll punch you then it'll be agree with me that my view is the right one or I'll hit you again. Let me explain what what faith isn't biblical faith, there is a whole lot of blind faith out there. So the famous atheist Richard Dawkins, his definition of faith is literally belief that isn't based on evidence. So that's the way he defines it. And a lot of people think that that that's the definition of it. That has nothing to do with evidence, or you don't need to, you know, use your brains anymore, those kinds of things. And so there is a version of faith like that, that I would just call it it's blind faith, it's choosing to believe something in spite of the evidence, or it's even the phrase a leap, a leap of faith bothers me. Because I feel like it's close your eyes and jump. It's this in this impression that I have to, well, I'm just gonna throw all reason out the window. And, and I think, unfortunately, a lot of churches, a lot of Christians reinforce that idea. Oh, my gosh, yes. Reason and faith have nothing to do with each other. And that they're opposite to each other. Right. That opposition I was raised on that. Yeah, I saw a church marquee that said that reason is the greatest enemy that faith has. Oh, my gosh, right. And so one of my pet peeves is church. Yeah, me too. We'll have to have a segment of church marquee segment in our podcast. Man, you want to get me fired up. My kids will tell you that they anyway, yeah, there've been times I want to pull over and like go inside and say who put this up? But anyway, so the the idea is that blind or faith all has to do with sincerity, right and feelings and in its religion. Whereas, like, there's knowledge and there's truth and there's fact and there's reality and they're they just don't go go with each other. And so again, a lot of Christians reinforces I love though, the way C.S. Lewis said, coming to faith, coming to Christianity was not a leap in the dark, but a step into the light. Yeah. And so that's don't you wish you could talk and write like that. Every time you hear that, you're like, that's why you're quoted all the time. Yeah, you deserve it. So my definition of a biblical faith is trusting in what you have reason to believe is true. Yeah. So equating faith with trust or belief like that, that's more the biblical view. But it's what you have reason to believe is true. And you see a lot of examples where God gives evidence or God gives reasons. Yesterday, a church John read from Ezekiel and over 60 times in the book of Ezekiel, God says that you may know that I'm the Lord. Yeah. And so I'm going to give you reasons to believe it. So it's again, there's a lot of verses that back that up that it's not blind faith. It's it's not wishing. It's not that sincerity is all that matters. It's yeah, it's well grounded trust you could use. And again, I think that's where if you look in even in Exodus, where in chapter six, God says, I'm going to do these things against Egypt, so that Israel will know that I'm God. And in chapter seven, he says, I'm going to do these things so that Pharaoh will know or the Egyptians will know, it was like the evidence is going to show something. And then you fast forward to the New Testament where in Mark two, Jesus heals a paralytic. But his first words before he healed them were your sins are forgiven, which set everybody off because like no only God can forgive. And Jesus goes, okay, so obviously me just saying your sins are forgiven, you can't see that happen. And so he actually asked the question, which is easier to say your sins are forgiven, or, you know, get up and walk. And then he says this, and I think this is helpful in our definition, he says that you may know, not hope, not wish that you may know that the Son of Man has the authority to forgive sins. And then he turns to the guy and says, take up your mat and walk, take up your bed and walk. So his point is, I'm appealing to evidence, like I'm saying here's, I just made a claim actually to be God. And this is, that's what was going on there. Right. He was saying that because they reason only God can forgive sins. So he said, I just made a claim there. And I'm now going to back it up by doing something that gives evidence to it. So that's, that's kind of my definition of faith. And so in our culture right now, where it seems like faith is just, you know, what you think or how you feel about that. Is that fundamentally then just a wrong definition? Say yours again, Chris, define it. I said trusting in what you have reason to believe is true. Okay. And for some reason, and I, again, I think if you look through scripture, that's what's presented that even Hebrews 11, one, the words that are used there in the Greek that Paul uses have to do with proof guarantee evidence. Um, even in a little later in Hebrews 11, again, all about faith that talks about Abraham reasoned, and it's where we get the word logic. Right. Um, he, so it's, it's again, not taught in scripture that you just throw your, you check your brains at the door. Um, that it's blind faith, things like that. Again, sometimes my faith can go beyond what I can see or beyond reason. Like that's wow. But I have, there's good reason for me to still trust what God is saying. That's actually the context of Hebrews 11 11 talking about Sarah's faith. And it's actually says that she considered him faithful who had made the promise. In other words, you're telling me that at my age, I'm going to have a baby. Right. That sounds, that goes beyond, you know, what I can see, but the person who made the promise is trustworthy. She reasoned, therefore I'm going to believe. So it would be irrational to believe that unless someone has the power to make it happen. That's all the time when, when I'm talking with somebody, they'll say it's about something like that. Like it's irrational for a donkey to talk. I'm like, well, I mean, unless there's someone who has the power to make a donkey talk, and then that's not irrational. That's like saying it's irrational for my nine year old to do back surgery on me. Yes. It's not irrational that a back surgeon would do back surgery on me. And so if someone has that power, that skill, that ability, it's not irrational think they would do it. If someone doesn't, it is irrational think they will do it. That's a, and so the, one of the difficulties, and I sympathize with this for the secular thinker is it's not a God of the gaps when we say God could do that. We're just acknowledging there's not a limit to his capacity. And I understand why that's frustrating. It feels like we're copping out when we say that. But as you know, as Billy Graham, you know, when someone asked Billy Graham about allegedly, there's a lot of legends about him, but that someone said, you really believe that, you know, a fish swallowed Jonah. And he was like, if God wanted it, Jonah could have swallowed the fish. I mean, it doesn't, it's not like that's like a big deal to God. Like, Oh no, now I'm stymied. Oh man. What do I do with this? And so if you spin stars, if you create something from nothing, I mean, there's a leap there. If I'm willing to accept there is someone who can create something from nothing, nothing else is all that tough, relatively speaking to say, well, he kept, how could he keep three people alive in a furnace? I mean, he created stars. I don't see why that would be a, that's certainly not a challenge. Like that's a tiny, tiny little capacity compared to what I am claiming God did. And so it's not, it's not hard for me to imagine that God would have that. So now, one of the things that hopefully will be fun for people listening to the podcast is, is when Chris and Chris disagree with each other. And so I, this is actually not a very good disagreement. It's a slight disagreement in wording. So I would take out the word reason. Now I'm going to agree with Chris that that is the correct definition for faith. That would be the right best definition for faith. I define faith as a psychological state of having been convinced to trust something. So Chris is saying you have a reason to trust it. I'm not so, I'm not so confident that you have an actual reason to trust it. You just do trust it. Does that make sense? You're giving me, you're giving me an uncertain look. Keep unpacking it. Colson was like thinking about love. I was, I was just thinking about all the words you said. I was like, okay, got it. I had a, I got into a discussion with a boss and some friends one time and I got done talking and then my boss goes, yeah, we all know you can say a lot of words. No, I, yes, I'm busted. Yes. So if you were going to unpack the difference, then, okay. So Chris would say, well, the way Chris's definition was trusting what you have reason to believe is true. Okay. Um, I would say you may or may not have a reason to believe it's true. Faith just says you do believe it's true. You may or may not have a good reason. You can have blind faith. You can have unreasonable faith. You can have delusional faith. Um, and maybe you would follow those under reasons. You would just call them bad reasons. Yeah. Or blind. Yeah. Yeah. I see what you mean. So I say it's a psychological state of having been convinced of something. That's why I went, when people use the word faith, they usually either mean it as a pronoun for their religion. Like, well, you know, my faith teaches this or, um, we're making faith exemptions for some law or something. And what they mean is you're, you're one of those religious kooks and we're giving you a name for that. Or it is a, I don't want to say the word Christianity because I know it's offensive. So I say my faith, or I don't want to say Islam because that makes people mad. And that's how I say my faith. Um, but, but so we use it as a pronoun for religion. Right. I don't like that usage. I try to avoid it, but I find myself doing it all the time, especially when I'm talking to people, I don't know what they believe. And I really am using it to kind of, I'm not yet going to reveal which faith it is because I know the minute you hear it, we're probably done talking. Like I just, um, I think when we use faith, we usually use it, and it's going to sound weird from an English perspective. We're using it as a verb. We're using it as a noun because we don't have a verb word for faith. Um, in the Greek, they do, but we're using it as a verb. When I say I have faith in something, I could simplify that. If we had the word faith as a verb, I faith that right. Um, there's one sense in which all faith is, is trust. You could, you could define it in just that word. That's the verb form. I believe, I trust. That's what faith means. So it almost always needs a modifier in my opinion. What type of faith I believe this, how are you believing it? It is a, it is a reasonable faith. It's a rational faith. It's an irrational, like I just used all the ones I just did, delusional, blind, um, evidence-based, all those things. Because if someone tells me I believe that, if I, so I take out the word faith, put in the word belief, which is the verb form in our Bible, almost always in English, it'll use the word, when it's the Greek word for faith, but it's in verb form, the Bible put in the word belief. I believe. So if you ask somebody, what do you believe? If they tell you they believe something, they have given you nothing except their own personal perspective. Um, ask anybody what they believe right now. Here we are in, in what is this? October of 2021. Ask people what they believe about the vaccine. They've given you probably no information when they're done talking, no, nothing standard to build anything by beyond what they personally hold. That faith, that belief they have is either rational or irrational. It's based on podcasts or, or scientific evidence or whatever. And, and the problem is the reason it's so divisive is because we don't know who to trust. We don't know who to trust in America right now. So when I say faith as a firm also always needs a modifier. So I would say, just to say, I believe this, I faith this, that's all you're telling me is that phrase. I believe this, right? Um, I believe that the government is, you know, beaming thoughts into my head, um, or aliens are. And I'm like, okay, I accept that you believe that you have given me no information for me to believe that. And that's, that's the statement. I need to know what that belief is coming from. Where are you getting that? Um, and that's also important when someone says, when we talk about why someone stops believing. So what does that take? What does that say about their truth statement? Jesus Christ is Lord of all. I know if someone says, I no longer believe that what have evidence have they given, what information have they now shared about that statement of accuracy? Nothing, right? There's no bearing. It doesn't matter what I mean, in the end, it doesn't matter what we believe about a truth. It's that's what we go back to the truth definition, right? Yep. So, um, yeah, I think I love thinking of faith. It helped me so much when I started thinking of faith as a psychological state of confidence, essentially. And I like to distinguish between the sincerity of your faith and the object of your faith. In other words, when, um, I actually did this, I think two weeks ago with the Ford students, we did a trust fall, right? On a picnic table. And then I had some guys catching her. Yes. And I said, there's the two parts that I would say are part of biblical faith or just correct faith, but maybe just faith in general is always the subjective part, the person doing the trusting. Right. But then it's a trustworthy object. And so Christianity would say, this is where apologetics comes in. Yes. We would say the object of our faith. Yes. So it's not just, and so I actually use this verbiage when I talk to my Mormon friends, I say, I'm not, I'm not doubting the sincerity of your faith. I'm doubting the object of your faith. Right. I know you're sincere. I mean, you're committing two years of your life to go door to door in the heat, wear the same thing every day, like whatever it is. I know you're sincere. It's what you're sincere about. I mean, the 9 11 terrorist were sincere about to go there. Yes. So it's what, what apologetics does is let me show you that the object of what we're believing in is trustworthy. It's convinced me because it doesn't matter when I do the trust fall, I talk about what if I replaced these forged, you know, strong young men with my, uh, one and a half year old granddaughter and she's catching you now. Right. Is it all about, look, but as long as you're sincere, as long as you believe that's all that matters, you go, no, no, no, no, no. We're all going to, I mean, you're going to get hurt. She's going to get hurt. So it's what you're sincere about, right? Not just that you're sincere. And I think that's part of the big issue today, even our culture that, that when you say Christianity is true, people take it to mean you're not letting other people subjectively believe something or sincerely believe something. You're like, I never said that. It just doesn't mean that it's objectively true. It just means that's true about you. Right. I'm so many Christian claims come back to this, right? That we, we, when we'd say to people and we try so many different analogies, whether it's, you know, jumping, jumping off a cliff and who can jump across the Grand Canyon, like, okay, either you can, or you can't jumping further is, is, is, is, it doesn't help. It doesn't, um, I don't know if you guys see any of the, some of my trust fall fails are one of the greatest video series in history. Like it'd be the ones where people fall forward, I think are some of the most outrageously funny and horrifying. A person standing up on a ladder, hands across their chest, eyes closed. And someone says fall and they fall forward because they don't realize the people are behind them. And so they think people are in front of them. And so they just fall. And just the terror on everyone's face as they fall is there else. We can't do anything for this person. It's, it's, um, man, but that's a great, man, they're apparently sincere. They just trust, fell with our eyes closed and their hands crossed and they are going to hit hard because they're wrong. Right. Well, and I think that's where Paul made this really clear, even in Romans chapter 10, where he talked about his fellow Jews, he said, I can testify that they are zealous. Yes. They're sincere. And so I would say what we, what we do, unfortunately, is we think that sincerity and religious activity mean you have truth and it just doesn't, it means you're, you're sincere. And Paul goes on to say, but the problem is they're trying to establish their own righteousness and not the righteousness that God provides. But his point there is, I know they're sincere. Right. It doesn't mean that you have the truth. I mean, I've gotten on the wrong plane before. Yes. I've, I've accidentally given my son Coby when he was a baby, um, ear drops when I thought they were stomach drops. Like I've, and you would say you were just sincerely wrong. Right. And so again, it's just a reminder that sincerity and truth don't always go together. No. So I believe you that you believe that I'm, I'm, I'm sure you believe that it's just what we need to talk about is the object of your belief. Yep. That's great. And so then we're seeing a lot of people deconstructing their faith in the way that's like, okay, well your faith, the object of your faith probably was what you were talking about kind of that straw on the hand. They have honestly failed them. Like that's what they, but what they had put their faith in may have truly been false. That is one they fell forward and they thought like, this is what I've been taught all my, and maybe they were taught that their whole life churches teach all kinds of horrible things. Right. And maybe they were taught all their life. Um, I teach a program called womenary and it's, it's women who have already been through Bible study training in incredible levels. I mean, many of them have graduated through all types of, and they wanted some theology training. And so they've asked different people with similar degrees to come teach them. And it's been amazing over the years as I throw something out there. The one that stood out to me so much at the beginning was the reference, the fact that, that men don't have one less rib than women. And I mean, the room was like a pin drop as they're like, wait, what, wait, what men, no, no, the evidence of Adam and Eve is that men have one less rib than women. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, no, no, they have the same number of, like, Oh shoot, you, you have read those accounts as there's some, you know, native American myth that like, and that's why rabbits have long ears, like, and that, that kind of a thing versus realizing, no, no, this is, there's something being taught there that you've missed at the expense of some weird mythological story. And, and it's a, uh, people still do it even that's a wrong, even when they say, and that's why snakes live there on the ground. Even that is a total misunderstanding of that passage. So, um, you know, when you referenced Paul in a, in Romans 10, I was thinking of what he says in, in act 17, um, men of Athens, I perceived that in every way you are very religious for I passed along and observe the objects of your worship. I'd like, I mean, if you, if you were in Athens in the first century, there was no doubt these were religious people. Right. Have you gotten, have you been up on the crop? Areopagus? Have never been there. I've seen Athens. Anyway, but the, uh, I could not believe, so there's not much up there, but what they had, they had the guy, the guide is showing us these little divots in the ground and the stone pavement. And, uh, and there's these little divots and he says, um, maybe she, she says, um, every one of those divots is where an idol stood. Oh my gosh, guys, they're like every foot and a half on the whole mountain top. There's just time. If they were all there, there would be a tiny path winding between them. And that's what Paul walked up to was to regard this conversation and just, man, you guys clearly are religious people. And see, he's, he's complimenting the sincerity part. He's like, I know you're sincere. Look, look at all this stuff. What I want to do now, what's funny is he then offers like, I'm going to correct you. Like I'm actually going to tell you now the truth. So he does a little bit of both where he's like, um, and he even quotes their poets and that's right. Like this is great. He's making common ground, but then he actually says, but now, and what I love is the end of that sermon he says, and God has given proof of this by raising Jesus from the dead, but it's actually the Greek word faith. He's given pistas. He's given nice faith by raising it's, it's the word that we translate in that context as, as evidence or proof or, but he then appeals to objective evidence. Um, so he's talking about both of those things there. That's great. And now I've got a comment because I can imagine if we have any listeners, um, they're going to be thinking, um, gosh, you guys are way off on this. This is not how I was raised at all. Right. I mean, this is not accurate to how I was read. Listen, I'm going to Christian my whole life and I was never allowed to ask hard questions. I was always shut down when I tried to ask those hard questions. I was always told, you know, that I was hurting Jesus's feelings when I asked questions like this. Um, and so I just can't imagine that there's going to be people who are feel like this is irreverent or we're, we're, we're trading on God's toes or something. Cause you're just, listen, you're just supposed to believe what God says to believe and not, not ask any questions and ask those hard questions because people get really uncomfortable when you do. And I'm trying to think of who it was. Someone told me just the other day that there was a question that they asked a pastor and when they were a child and they got their head bitten off by the pastor for their lack of faith and their doubt and told, you know, essentially don't come back, don't ever come back. And, and that, that set her on a path for years of, of going, oh gosh. And that's just this weird, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain kind of religion. And so if you were raised with that version, I was grew up in a situation where there were some of that in the church that I grew up in. Fortunately, I was raised by a scientist, my dad, environmental scientist, and my mom who's a speech pathologist. And we were always not only allowed, but encouraged to ask questions about just about any of it. I just can't imagine you ever asking questions. There were other places where I would do it. Also, I even, even when I did it, when it was somebody who could have shut me down, like a Sunday school teacher, if they didn't have any idea what they were talking about, they would just say like, you know what, Chris, that's a great question. Let's, let's get back to the subject at hand. Cause I probably was often off top. I know it's a crazy thought me off topic, right? But I really speaking of back to, can I give an example though, please do of, of, of people are wondering, like, oh, you shouldn't ever doubt. Yeah. Right before Jesus gave the greatest compliment to John the Baptist ever. No man born a woman who's greater than John. Right. Yes. John had just asked, he just questioned really Jesus. Are you really, are you really the one who I thought, so here's John. He's the, essentially the last old Testament prophet in one sense. He's coming on the scene, making these, I'm preparing the way for the Messiah. He's the one that God told me. And then that lands, he ends up in jail and he's, he's having doubts. And so he sends his disciples to Jesus saying, so are you the actual one, or should we be waiting for someone else? Yep. And I can picture John's kind of like, this is not how I saw this ending. Yep. And so Jesus doesn't reprimand him. He doesn't go, what are you thinking? How could you doubt you're supposed to be my wingman? Whatever it is. This is a guy who leapt in his mother's womb when he met Jesus. Right. Jesus then appeals to evidence. He goes, go back and ask John. So what have you seen? What evidence is there? And so, you know, the, the, you know, blind or seeing the lamer walk, all those things. And then he turns to the audience, to the people around him and starts talking about John, what did you expect to see of things? But then he compliments John in the greatest way possible. So again, Jesus isn't scared of our questions and it's not, you don't ever see that the teaching or the implication in scripture, like don't come to God with your doubts. Don't come to him with your questions. We talked about Thomas last time, who was just honest. Yep. You know, so I think of twice Paul does this once with Thessalonians and the Thessalonians are for the Thessalonians. And then I'm not sure off top of my head where the other one is. But when he's talking to Thessalonians and he's saying, don't despise prophecies. In other words, don't throw them away automatically, but test everything, hold fast to what is good. And that that's, by the way, that the Greek word there test that's documos. Yep. And so too, that's the root of it anyway. But the test it don't, this is, this is the story right before I told it that I was referencing in, I think the Berean church is right before the Athens church. It's very soon before that. You're right. When it talks about the, it's a church that Paul comes and preaches and he teaches and when he gets done, they all go, all right, we'll go home and check. Yep. And so they go gather and they get copies of the, apparently of the scriptures and they test everything Paul says and they're honored. This isn't what's our, what's amazing to me is how often people walk away from Christian teaching, saying, you know, somehow doubt is a lack of faith or doubt is sin or doubt is, I'm like, I'm like, here, here's my Bible. Show me. Yeah. Find me an example of that with, especially in the new Testament, find me any example that you could even twist to say that. And I just don't think it's there. Yeah. So our faith is not dependent on our knowledge. That would be Gnosticism. Our faith is a, is a gift that we can have and we can reasonably evidentially, that's a real word or not, we'll go with it. And we can believe, we can accept and we can believe based on that. Yeah. And even if you read an Acts at the very beginning, it says, and Paul went in as was his custom to the synagogue there. And on three Sabbath days, he reasoned with them from the scriptures, explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from the dead. And he convinced people they needed the same thing in Athens where he's reasoning, he's proving he's giving evidence. Not just saying, trust me, like he's actually saying there's reason to what I'm telling you. There's, there's evidence to back this up.
