My name is Colson Lettner and in the studio with me today is nobody. That's right because today's episode is not actually an episode. It's just a quick update as you probably saw from today's episode title. It's just an update to let you know that we have not canceled the Reconstructed Faith podcast. No, no, no, never fear. We have just been on a brief hiatus because Chris Legg was on a sabbatical and I was on a paternity leave and so we are all back in the office now and we are actually going to meet today, April 4th, to get back at generating some more episodes. And so we're thankful for your patience, thankful for those of you who reached out to let us know that you were really benefiting from what we were bringing for you guys and we hope that that will continue to be a great ministry and a great way to equip you guys on your journey as you're one, dealing with and wrestling with truth yourself, but also helping others, loved ones and family who are dealing with those things as well. So I'm excited for you guys to hear from the Chris's and from some special guests soon. And yeah, you'll be hearing from us in the coming weeks. All right.
