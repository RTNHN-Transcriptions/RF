We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, and in the studio are some of my regular partners in crime and one new guest. It's a full studio today. Chris Legg is out, but we have Chris Sherrod is in. Hey, Chris. Howdy. We have Bryn Starnes back again. Hello, I'm back. Wonderful. A guest appearance is Laini Buchanan. Hello. Thank you for being here, Laini. So happy to be here. Wonderful. Well, we've talked a little bit kind of referencing a conversation that we've wanted to have with Laini for a while, just about her story and kind of how we reference things, people like Bart Ehrman and facts and truth and whatever. And so I'm going to throw it over to Chris Sherrod first. And can you just kind of kick off the conversation for us today? I'd be happy to. So seven years ago now, what are we saying? Eight years ago, goodness. I was teaching the Forge, which is a one year discipleship program that Pineco does. And I teach apologetics. So do different topics. God, the Bible, Jesus, creation, things like that. And Laini was a student there. This would have been your junior year, right? If you're a junior of college. Yeah, during my junior year. Yeah. So I was just going through my notes as usual, teaching on the reliability of the Bible and how it's not the telephone game and like manuscript evidence is actually really strong in favor of what we have today. And I just remember looking down and seeing Laini crying, like seeing tears coming down her face. And I'm thinking, what did I say? Like, is she having a bad day? Like, I don't know what was going on. But anyways, afterwards, I don't know if I came up to you or called you up or whatever, but I just said, are you OK? Like, what was going on there? So walk us through that. What was, what were you feeling then? And then back up and tell us what led you to that point. Sure. Yeah, what I was feeling then, I remember the timing of your apologetics class was, I think it was a, it was either a Monday or Wednesday in the morning. And a year before that every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, around the same time I had been in Bart Ehrman's New Testament class at UNC. And I remember sitting in your class hearing all of the reasons for the reliability of scripture and just kind of crying and thankfulness that I was getting to hear the opposite side of what I had been hearing the year previously. And also just feeling so deeply for my friends who I knew were in Bart Ehrman's class while I was sitting in a totally different setting, getting to experience good academic truth about the reliability of scripture. OK. So back up, so you, what were you doing? Why were you in his class? That was just a class you had to take or you were? Yes. So, um. Where were you? Yeah, I was in, I was at UNC, I was a sophomore and I had signed up for Bart Ehrman's New Testament class. And I took that class, I think kind of as a challenge. A lot of my friends were taking it and I was a religious studies minor at the time. So I just signed up because a lot of my friends were doing it. And I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Yeah. Yeah, do we want to talk about Bart Ehrman? Yeah. Tell us what he taught. Like, just so people know. Because some people listening will know, Bart Ehrman, some people won't know. Yeah, he is an American scholar in New Testament and he specializes in textual criticism and who Jesus is, the origins of Christianity, all of that. One of the leading scholars, if not the leading scholar. He writes the textbooks for all liberal universities for Old Testament, New Testament. The textbook I was using in his class was written by him. Which one was it, you know? I just remember it being called New Testament, so I don't really know. The reason I say that is ironically he wrote one with Bruce Metzger. The Duke. I'm not sure where he's from, but it's called The Text of the New Testament and it's actually really in favor of reliability. And so it's so ironic that Bruce is very conservative and then Bart co-wrote with him and knows all the facts. It's more how they're presented. The book that got him famous was called Misquoting Jesus. That's kind of kicked off his whole popularity. And is his whole thing that there is no reliability? Or what was that like? I guess what is it and then what was that like being a student under him, being a believer? Yeah. So he actually claimed to walk with Jesus for a long time. I think he came to UNC to teach because it is such a liberal campus and he thought all evangelize here. But through his study of scripture and textual criticism as he applied it to scripture and all of that, he was a very good teacher. But he still teaches. If you want to take New Testament or Old Testament at UNC, he's the professor. And then I imagine most liberal universities are going to be teaching at UNC. Yeah. And then he's the professor. He's the professor. And then he's the professor who's going to be teaching at UNC. If you want to take New Testament or Old Testament at UNC, he's the professor. And then I imagine most liberal universities you're using his... Yeah. He's so brilliant and charismatic and I'm pretty sure... I don't remember when they found the Dead Sea Scrolls. Do you remember what? In the 1940s. Okay. 1948, 1947, 1948. There was something new they found. Oh. I don't remember. It was like around the time that we were at UNC and I remember him talking about getting a phone call about it. So he... Wow. He just is, yeah, really, really brilliant guy. So he... I can just tell you what the beginning of his class is like and how he structured it and all of that. But the first day of his class, there's probably 200 students, 250 students in there. He says, okay, stand up if you're a Christian. So I remember standing up. Wow. Okay. And then he says, okay, stay standing if you think the Bible is the Word of God and is like the authority in your life. And so a lot of people stay standing and then he says, okay, keep standing if you've read all of it. The majority of people sit down. I don't really remember where I was at that point if I remained standing or sat down. But yeah, and then he like thinks it's really comical and then he starts teaching. So he says that his goal in the class, and I don't know if this is still true, but he said, most of you probably believe what you believe because that's what your parents told you. And so I want to make sure you have all of the objective resources and all of that to make a decision for yourself. And that's reasonable and all of that. So he comes at it like, this is going to be really objective. But I would say it was not an objective class at all. I don't know how you take away your preconceived notions when you teach anything. Right. Yeah. Wow. So was it little by little as he presented stuff you felt more and more threatened in your faith or what you believed or how did you feel? Yeah, he definitely, well, I can give you an example of some assignments that we were given. Like even my final exam essays, the prompts were, okay, tell me why the book of acts is historically unreliable or write about why Paul and Jesus advocated fundamentally different religions. So it was kind of like, right. And like, if I don't write what the reasons that he's given me for the book of acts being historically unreliable, then they weren't going to get objective prompts. It's like that trap where you ask someone, do you still beat your wife? Yes. Either way, if you admit it, if you say yes or say no, you admit that you beat your wife at some point. Yeah. On Fridays, we had a recitation, which was just like, I'm sure a lot of you know what that is, but just a smaller class with a TA to do more interactive discussion with like 20 or so students. And one of my assignments was to debate on the affirmative that Paul and Jesus advocated different religions. And I remember one of my friends, her assignment was to talk about the affirmative of why Paul was abusive to women or just like very, it was a weird, and I had no resources to know, do I do this for the grade? What do I, yeah. So even though I knew what I believed, by the end of that year, I could defend the total opposite way better. So that's where I found myself sitting in Chris's class. Yeah. Well, and I think that's, that is such a hard spot to be in. Cause I think a lot for a lot of people, colleges already without somebody, you know, academically challenging your faith, it's already a spot where you're like, Oh, okay. Well, my faith is my own. I'm out from underneath my parents. So a lot of people are already wrestling with that. I can't imagine, like personally, that would be really tough to then walk into a class where you're like, okay, now I'm learning how to, how to defend this other side of things. So I guess from there, then you're at Chris in Chris's class. How did that, I guess, did that cause you to lose any faith or did you have to kind of go back to the drawing board, kind of reconstruct what you believed? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. Um, yeah. One of our, one of our big assignments in the forge was to write our own statement of faith. So what we believe about the Bible, what we believe about who Jesus says, the Trinity, all of those things. And we had to write a paper about each with like reasons why. Um, and so I remember like starting at the first one thinking, I have one book to like look through, but I just, every time I started to write something, I could hear our airmen in my head or just all the things I learned about. I had this mountain of information about the opposite. And so it just felt like this. Yeah. How do I, how do I begin to sift through all of these things that I, I never really, I, I did not feel like I wavered in, I knew the God of the Bible. I had a personal experience with him. I think I was preserved by reading scripture growing up and knowing scripture, but Bart airman attacks the reliability of the Bible. And so I think what I needed answered was how do I, I believe the Bible is true, but how do I know that? Because everything else follows. Um, if the Bible is true, then the God of the Bible is who he says he is. The Bible is, I can, you know, stake my life on that. Um, so I don't really remember the question you originally asked. That was really good. And so I guess, so, I mean, what, my main question was like, okay, kind of where you go from there as you're finding or at least establishing, okay, what is the faith that I believe in light of what I've learned in this class. And then, so that was great kind of going back to the other side of things, Chris, when you, when you have this conversation with Laney and you hear, Oh, I was in Bart airman's class and you have kind of a knowledge or working knowledge of kind of where he's at. What, what steps are you taking to help somebody be like, help them to reconstruct in a way. Are you given the resources? Are you like, I guess what, where do you go next in that conversation? Yep. Well, I always refer to back. I mean, it was maybe 10 years ago when Ben Stewart was leading breakaway down in, at A&M, he did a whole talk called I think it was called has the Bible been corrupted. But if you type that in, you can find that talk given at a church and some other spots. And he talked about Bart airman and, um, the thing that's interesting, and this is where it's disappointing with Bart airman because um, he is telling you the truth in that we don't have the originals and we don't have a copy of the copies, but he kind of, and he, and he claims how many variants we have, how many differences we have, we have more, well, 400,000. We have more variants of texts than we do have words in the new testament. And so if you just leave it hanging at that, everybody panics. It's like, Oh my goodness, I'm going to, I'm going to, but what people don't know is okay, what counts as a variant? And so for example, every time there's a difference between Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus, that counts as a variant every time. And so you start going, is that that big a deal? And we will go, no, that has nothing to do with anything we believe, but he stops and he doesn't tell you all those differences that there's none that are meaningful to any theology that we hold. And the fact that we have so many copies and manuscripts is actually great. If you're a textual critic, the Bible, more than any other book is like this beautiful, huge collection of what anyone would ever want to go back to reconstruct the original. So the more copies we have actually helps us figure out, you know, what the original said. But so that's where I feel it's a little sinister on his part that he knows all this. And now there's, let me just go and pause because there could be people listening that might've already freaked out by me saying, we don't have the originals. We didn't have copies of the copies. We don't have copies of the copies of the copies. And a big reason for that is what the Bible was written on would basically be the consistency of a paper bag, which is going to fade over time. And so that's why you had people whose full time job was to be a scribe. So we can talk more about copies and things later, but that's where it just bothers me with him because he has an agenda. He has a goal to undermine your faith. I am all for what he said at the beginning, Hey, you've just been raised believing this. So we want to give you the objective facts. I'm like, right, but are you really going to give me all of the facts? Right. And you would say every, or all the major scholars for the most part agree with him. Yeah. See, that would be where, and it depends and see, that's almost like, it's like the word evolution. Like, do you believe in evolution? It's like, well, what do you mean? Michael or a macro, like what, when you say scholars agree with you on what part, right? Like they could agree with, Yeah, like, so there's an interesting debate online with Daniel Wallace versus Bart Ehrman. And Daniel Wallace is the foremost expert right now. He's the one, I think I had sent you guys a link for the center for the study of New Testament manuscripts. Like he is an expert and I think Chris Legg had him as a teacher. Oh, wow. It was really cool. Like I was about to teach on reliability and I just emailed him. I said, what's the most up to date number of manuscripts we have? And he replied. It was like, it was like a movie star acknowledging you or calling you by name. I was like, no way. He was like, he righted or his secretary? No, it was from him. He screenshotted it and sent it to all your friends. I'm so cool. But anyways, if you just go to YouTube, there's, what a Bible nerd. Right? Exactly. Yeah. But this is where people geek out. They're really our scholars. Like they get into all the details that most of us, it makes us yawn until we get challenged in our faith. And then you go, okay, we need to listen to these nerds. Do you take time to count all these things and to explain, you know, textual criticism, which, which you have to do for any ancient book. So anything that we have that's ancient like Plato or Aristotle or I mean, about those people or written by them or Homer's Iliad, like all that stuff, you have to go back and say, okay, so what do we have? And the Bible is like far, far ahead of any of those things. Even far surpasses like ancient manuscripts of a very accepted documents like Shakespeare, right? Like anything that no one questions at all. People treat his history. Right. Yeah. The same textual criticism was applied to other books. We wouldn't. Yeah. Yeah. We would discount everything. Yeah. And the main thing with, with textual criticism, the questions that you ask are, um, how many manuscripts do we have, which is a handwritten copy and then how close to the original is that copy that you had? So that's what you ask. And those are the two main questions that if you're a textual critic, that's, that's what you do. Yeah. So that's why they geek out because they're like, does this count? It's just a fraction. Like there's sometimes they're literally have like a corner of a piece of something that they're, I think this is part of whatever, but, um, but they get excited about it. Yeah. So that's what textual criticism is. Okay. That's awesome. So kind of going back to other resources that might've been helpful or things, I mean, cause I know Laney now you, you still attend church. You're still a believer. Um, can you talk about maybe, I see you have a book in front of you, maybe some resources that have helped you or how maybe some of the, even though it was difficult walking through that and go, and having to like deconstruct what you had learned, even just like suppressing Bart Ehrman's voice in your head, maybe how that's helped you in your faith as it's grown or how you've even had conversations with other people who have been feeling with difficulty in their faith. Yeah. Um, I don't remember when you gave me this Chris, but it was soon after that first conversation we had. Well, I gave you that. Well, this is a different copy. I borrowed yours in Reddit and get back to you. But then I bought one. Um, but yeah, I, I read the book truth matters, confident faith in a confusing world. I don't, we can include it, right? Yeah. And we'll, we'll put it in the show notes, but no, that's great. No, yeah. Please do. And who's it by? Oh, you can, I need to listen. One of them is a lot of Andrew costume burger, Darrell Brock, Darrell Bach, and Josh Chateau. I'm sorry. I didn't listen to you. Okay. But truth matters is what you're saying matters. Yeah. And it, I think one of these guys who wrote it had a daughter, somebody who took Ehrman's class. And so I think this book was written and it referenced as Ehrman a lot and a lot of the things he brings up in his class, but written for students who took his class just to kind of go through all the things that he taught and hear all the reasonable reasons that we can believe the Bible is true. So do you have one that stands out to you as like, was a linchpin or like really encouraging to you? I think the number of manuscripts thing, like actually understanding the amount of manuscripts we have of the Bible and what the discrepancies are and how little they have to do with our theology. That was huge. I am trying to think if there are any others. I think, and this, this might be a little unrelated, so you can cut those goals. But I remember, so Ehrman said at the beginning, Hey, I'm going to tell you at the end of class or at the end of the semester, my story of like what it, what really did me and what like made me change my mind on all of this. And what he came to was the problem of suffering. And so that was like, well, I can reconcile that with who I know God to be and what I know of scripture and my own experiences and suffering. And so I thought it was really interesting that it wasn't all of this academic research that was like the last straw for him. It was suffering. And so, yeah, that was really interesting that like, okay, you have all of this, these resources that you're using to back this up, but really it's suffering that, that you can't. It didn't, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Colson, you asked a few more things and I'm trying to. Well, then where, so from Chris's class, then what was your journey like moving forward with that topic specifically or resources? Like you mentioned, truth matters. Yeah, I, I'm not really super skeptical and I'm not a big researcher. So it really just took some, some men in my life, men of authority, great teachers, and then books like truth matters, systematic theology. I watched some debates with Earmen and yeah, I watched those and sat with, with Matt Lance through some of those and talked through. But I'm pretty simplistic just in the way I'm wired and the way that I think not in like a simple minded, I don't think I'm dumb, but I like black and white thinker. So it really just took like, okay, here are the reasons the Bible is true. That's all I need to know. So I know some of my friends journeys might have been a little bit longer and with leaving school to do the forge and then not actually going back to UNC after that. I don't know how a lot of that, I wasn't doing life closely with a lot of those people. So yeah. And then I think what's your other question about like conversations with friends? Like, has this come up? Yeah. And I guess, I guess I'm just curious because I know, I mean, I'm sure this happens everywhere, but you have kind of this strong relationship that you build with people within, you know, you did the forge, which is, you know, an intensive kind of leadership discipleship thing. There are a lot of those kinds of things and a lot of those experiences across the nation. Then I've seen just some people within the, you know, who come off of one of those experiences and they have a big deconstruction to where it's like, okay, I don't believe this anymore. And their life is drastically different. And so I don't know if you have anybody that's like that, but if you've had any conversations with those people, because that can be different or that can be difficult because it's like, okay, but you know the truth. And so I'm, I guess that's, that's where my mind goes in a lot of ways of like, okay, you know, the truth. A lot of, a lot of our listeners, if they're not dealing with deconstruction on their own, are one, they're parents of, you know, people who they're like, okay, what if somebody deconstructs in my life? What if my children, you know, or myself, if I'm coming up with, you know, if I'm, you know, coming up against these difficulties, how am I going to have these conversations? And so I think it's beneficial to hear like, okay, how do, how do, in reality, how are we thinking through this and conversing with people about this? And I think it's important for everyone because just because you have been doubted, assuming you won't, you won't run into it. And as our culture gets increasingly more antagonistic, you're going to hear more of these. The first time I really heard it, I had to deal with it when I was on staff at a church in Georgia was when the Da Vinci code came out. So the book had been out, but then the movie was coming out and it brought to light all this stuff. And I do remember, I remember sitting in a Panera bread restaurant. You call it a restaurant? Sure. Sitting in a Panera bread, listening to these, over here in these ladies next to me at their table, like, did you hear about that new book? I don't want to make fun of their southern action. But it was all like, well, I just don't believe it. I'm just, I just have, and they really said something like, I just have faith. And I was, I wanted to talk to them, but I felt like I'd be coming across as kind of mansplaining. I don't know. I was just like, I don't want to have to, but it really was no, in my brain. I'm like, that's not the right way to face it. It's like, let's listen to what he says. And again, the book itself is fiction, but he claims that it's all in the scholarship and how the Bible was, you know, had an agenda to hide who Mary Magdalene was, all this stuff, which is, it's a fun read as far as action and adventure, but it brought up a whole bunch of issues on can you trust the Bible? And so I think pleading faith, blind faith is not the way to go. Just, you know, the other one is just subjective feelings. I just know, I read it. I just know because, and I was teaching the Forge last week on Mormonism, that that's, that's what good Mormon missionaries will tell you. They'll give you a copy of the book of Mormon and say, hey, James one five says pray for wisdom. And so we invite you to pray and then to read the book of Mormon. And if you're really sincere, you'll know. And it's like, well, well, and the reason that works for them is then if you, you don't know, then they can just say, well, apparently you weren't sincere enough. Yeah. And then we've talked about it before, but arguing the Bible is the Bible is God's word because it says it's God's word that isn't helping either. So yeah. Yeah. I think to you, a lot of you guys have talked about this on previous podcasts, but a lot of the people in my life that I see deconstructing and not trying to reconstruct, well, I guess that's what I'm saying is there's not like a, hey, I want to have intellectual conversations about the reliability of scripture or it's more of like, this is what feels good to me. And this is what I think is good. And so yeah, not attempting to reconcile that with what the Bible says. So I think I'm running into more of, okay, I just want to learn and ask you questions and meet you where you are. Because most of my experiences that the people in my life have not been interested in, that's not the linchpin that's keeping them from following Jesus. It's whatever, yeah, they're walking through and have decided it's true for them. Right. And I think a lot of this goes back to stuff we've covered that it's not intellectual reasons at the end of the day with Bart Ehrman. It's an emotional struggle, which we all can have. But is that your reasoning, is that a good reason to throw everything out? Right. Yeah. Because again, when he doesn't tell you, I'm sorry, I'm still camping on this, but there are differences in how we spell John. There's times when it says the Christ or just Christ. Like all of those small things, you just go, that's the, yeah, that's a difference. It is clearly a difference. There's spelling differences, like the way we spell honor and someone from England spells honor, H-O-N-O-U-R. But you've got that in some of the texts where it's like, okay, but it's the same word. You're making it sound like it's this huge thing. And then there's times when you just know that you can tell which one it is. One time Paul says, one version says, we were gentle among you. We were like, yeah, we were gentle among you. And then one says, we were like horses among you. And it's like, I think that's a typo or a missed copy. And we know that he said we were gentle among you. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And then there's other ones that really are, there are, this is so funny because Ben Sura mentioned this in his talk, that the whole, the number of the beast in the book of Revelation, is it 666, and you've got all these eighties hair bands with, you know, that's like all about their thing. And there are, right. There are copies of some manuscripts that say 616. Right. And you just go, that doesn't affect anything meaningful about our faith. Right. Even the bigger ones. Yeah. There was one that, right. You talked about, I think it's in the gospels and then maybe, yeah, maybe somewhere in the epistles, it's with the feeding of the 5,000, they talk about the priest during the time. And they're like, one of them says, Ananias, one of them says, I'm getting the names wrong, but another, yeah, pre-starting with an A. But to know like, okay, the importance of chronological and time and just the way we look at things is so different now than the way they wrote about things. And those two priests were residing around the same, like pretty contemporary of each other. And, you know, how we talk about like president Bush, we still call him president Bush. He's not the current president. Just even the ones that they would have, you know, think are bigger. Really, they're reasonable answers for why they are the way they are. Right. And when, when you look at the number of them compared to how many manuscripts there are, there really isn't an argument here, I don't think when you know the full picture. Well, with that story, it'd be like me going, are you sure it's exactly 5,000 people? Yeah. Are you positive? Did they count? You know what I'm saying? Like what if it was 5,003? Like it's, that has nothing to do with any of the reliability of the Bible because we ran numbers up all the time. But also the context, it doesn't change who Jesus is, but count it as a variant. Like you can count, but it doesn't change the, so like, it's something like 95 points. Something percent of them have no bearing on anything. And then the other ones are, here's the reasons why we think it's actually more reliable to believe this and stuff, but there's no essential Christian truth that, that's affected by that. Yeah. Which almost sounds like God had a message that he wants to make sure he gets passed on to us. Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess going from, from this conversation, then if we have people who are listening today and who have maybe gone through some academic study, whether it's of their own or for, you know, have gone through something in college and they haven't, they're still in the spot of like, okay, how do I, how do I practically kind of, whether it's reading a book to kind of defeat, not defeat, but like give me reasonable things. You know, we mentioned this book, Chris, do you have any other resources or practical tips of like, Hey, don't live in this. Like it's good to, it's good to challenge things. It's good to think critically of what you believe. But then continue thinking, don't just, don't just live in that. Well, I guess it's wrong. You know, when, when you're, you're met with that. Yep. There are so many Vinnies. So we've already mentioned you can listen to a talk. You can actually watch the talk of Ben Stewart as Bob has been corrupted. If you really want to geek out, you can watch the Bart Ehrman Daniel Wallace debate, which is two hours. I'm looking on here. It's over two hours long. Well, you can just be one hour if you listen to it, listen to it at two times speed. Yeah, that's true. This one says three. I don't know how long it went, but so you can do that. There's the book truth matters that she mentioned. There's an updated version of evidence that demands a verdict by Josh McDowell and his son, Sean McDowell weighs in. Okay. That's all been updated. There is the website that I mentioned that you can go to. It's Daniel Wallace's whole thing. And he's probably one of the best experts today, but it's the center for the study of New Testament manuscripts is really, really good. It's CSNTM. So it's all of those. Yeah. CSNTM.org. And then even I think a really helpful just short article that summarizes this, it gives you a quick snapshot. Standard Reason is one of my favorite apologetics ministries. And if you just go to their search engine and type misquoting Jesus, he has an article that addresses Bart Ehrman and explains even the number of manuscripts gives a really helpful illustration of if you had this old recipe and your family of Aunt Sally's secret sauce and all the children copy it down, but then you lose her original and then they make copies. Like how do you, how would you go back and you just, it's a really practical, easy to grasp article that just gets to the kind of the meat of this is the way you need to think about it. So that's a really helpful one too. So those are all different venues on how you, different learning styles. I think that you've got plenty of resources there. That's great. Wonderful. Is there anything else you want to add to this? My last question, and I think you covered most of this, but just in summary, because as we walk with not only addressing doubt in ourselves, but as we walk with others, what are helpful, what were helpful behaviors, questions, like interactions that people had with you as you were wrestling through doubt, just for parents or friends or as we are acknowledging that we all have doubts, it's good to push into those and not just ignore them. But I know often, even for like parents of or friends of individuals that are wrestling with doubt, it's easy to react and be afraid that they're wrestling with doubt. So what would you say was like helpful or just encouragement? Yeah. Yeah, I think definitely asking good questions and listening and meeting people where they are obviously. But I think the most helpful thing for me was being told there are resources. There are answers to these questions. And yeah, yeah, just knowing that they're, I guess the arguments that are out there for the unreliability of scripture, Jesus doesn't claim to be God, whatever people are saying, there is just as much evidence for the opposite that that even stands up better than what you're being told. And yeah, I think in the midst of walking through this continuing to talk to the Lord, continuing to be in scripture, and just having conversations in general, like not just stewing on my doubts, but talking about them and facing them and remembering that the God of the Bible is not afraid of our doubts and welcomes them. And yeah, yeah, just walking through it with them. Which can be scary because we've said this before, if you come across some teaching or even a part of the scripture that looks like a contradiction or what's scary is you think it's scary for you because it's the first time you've thought about it. For the first time you've heard someone attack scripture if you've been sheltered or haven't even thought about it yourself, but it's not the first time anyone's ever thought about this. And that's where keeping it to yourself can be dangerous versus going like, oh my goodness, I'm not the only one or somebody's already answered this and there's whole books that you can go to. So to not freak out, but still be willing, and I think the big challenge is be willing to get a little nerdy, to get a little geeky and just to go, well let's talk about this stuff because these numbers really do matter and these scholars really know what they're talking about and so we should listen to what they say.
