We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lettner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lettner alongside my partners in crime, Bren Starnes and Chris Legge. We are continuing our conversation with Dan Ray. Dan, thanks again for being here, for traveling the few hours on the interstate to be with us. As we jump into this next portion, I'm going to throw it over to Bren to kick us off on the direction where we're starting off. We were just talking a minute ago over lunch in between recording, and we were talking about you were saying how your story is still unfolding. I think that's a really encouraging thing to hear, and I think it's encouraging for others because often I think we do view deconstruction or reconstruction as a finish line or a goal that is something other than when we die and go to be with the Lord. I think that's encouraging for me and for others to hear, like, this is still unfolding. My story is still continuing. All that to say, some of the things that we keep coming back to are our anchors in our life of what are things specific to you that when you have those seasons of, or that question that comes up, or an event that happens that causes you to doubt or have questions, what are the things that you personally come back to that are encouraging and reassuring to you? Yeah, I'm just curious. I think the biggest thing is, and I know this may seem, it'll be at different points for different people, but I agree that everybody kind of cycles through questions and doubts. But I think one of the things, and some people survive this and some people don't, and I'm not saying I'm anything special because I've survived this far, but God has to, and He'll do it differently for each of us, but God has to bring us to the end of ourselves. We have to be bled and drained of all the swamp of self-sufficiency. And when you survive that process, it reminds me of the Psalm where you lifted me out of the mire and put my feet on solid rock. So the mire, biblically, is self in some sense, and sin. When you have complete failures in your life, and there might be one big one or several little ones, or you're constantly in the swamp and you know you can't save yourself, think of the paralytic at the fountain, Jesus asks him, do you want to be made well? He doesn't say yes. He's just laying there saying, well, I can't get into the water. That's not what I asked you. Or the man-born line, that the disciples, and this is all of us, right? The disciples. Lord, this is the kind of questions that we want to know. Lord, did this man sin or his parents sin? We want the dirt. We want to know why he got canceled. Why did he lose his eyesight? And I think in John 9 is basically a synopsis of the book of Job, because the disciples might be looked at as Job's friends, that certainly somebody must have sinned here. Right, exactly. And Jesus drops the bomb. Nobody sinned. It is so that the glory of God, or the works of God may be displayed in him. And this is exactly what the book of Job is, because what is God's response to Job? But a treatise on the works of what God has made. But Job had to come to the end of himself, because he was righteous. But here's the thing that I think that we mistakenly believe about Job, and this just comes from my own suffering, that it's God's declaration of Job that makes Job righteous. Probably Job's problem was that he did have a good relationship with God, but I'm going to venture a guess and say that Job thought he was righteous because of what Job was doing, not because of what God said of him. So the process was painful for Job, because his friends kept accusing him. Certainly you've done something, buddy. Nobody has this happen to them without there being some sin in their life. And Job's like, look, I didn't do anything. But then God had to set the record straight and show us it's just his declaration. I have declared that you are righteous. You don't earn that. Right. And of course, Job's complaints are that I was this, I was that, I had this great thing, and I did this. And we see all the deeds that Job does, and he prays for his friends. And certainly these are good things. I'm not saying that the works themselves are bad, but I think what we all struggle with is that self-righteousness. The disciples can't imagine that a man would be born blind for the glory of God. Right. I can't imagine that either. Johnny Eric Santata, who had a diving accident, and she's for years pleaded with the Lord that he would restore her. It's tragic to hear her struggle with that. And why, Lord, why do I have depression? Why did my dad die? Why this? Right. We all have our things. Paul had the messenger of Satan. Right? We at least get a reason there. Paul knew that it was to humble him because of the revelation that God was giving him. And to some degree, I empathize with Paul because on my podcast, I've interviewed scholars, and authors, and scientists, and theologians, and I've had a front row seat to some of the best minds and christened him over the last few years at Watchmen. And I'm thinking, why me, God? And so I think the key factor is the anchor for me has always been, I see God take away stuff from my life, and then I see his faithfulness. So I've had these experiences where God has been faithful when I have been emptied of everything. I have nothing. And then, well, I'm taking away... There's nothing on my resume that's gonna make me climb back up. There's nothing on my resume that's gonna make me stand up and take my palate and walk. There's nothing on my resume that's gonna open my eyes. I'm on the ground. I'm in the dust. I can't speak. I don't know what's going on. And God is faithful. So it's his faithfulness. And I love astronomy and cosmology. And in Jeremiah 31, God talks about a new covenant and his faithfulness. And he says, if the fixed order of the heavens departs from me, then so will my faithfulness depart from Israel. So the heavens remind me of God's faithfulness, that they're there always in time in and time out in every season, sunrises and moon times and all this stuff. It's so regular that atheists can't explain, science can't explain the regularity why it's there, but it's there. And that regularity in the cosmos reminds me of God's faithfulness, but it has nothing to do with me. It finally doesn't have... I mean, that's kind of a dangerous thing to say that for some people it might just be licensed to go and do whatever because God's always gonna be faithful. That's not what I'm saying. That's not what Paul's saying. It's that when you experience those times of God's faithfulness in the midst of your own loss, that you don't wanna offend or grieve that God. The more he is gracious to you, it's the goodness of God that leads to repentance. So to me, the greatest... I'd say it's the one thing. It's not friends or family or money or success or my latest podcast. It's God's faithfulness. But I can't see that, and I would never have seen that unless He had taken me through things where I was bereft of all my supports that I would tend to go to. It is interesting to me, so what you just described is the thought that someone could be taken through a time of not having supports, of not having the internal structure to support your own identity that so many people think they have, and yet here you are. Your response to that was not, well, God, if that's what you have for me, then like we hear from so many people who deconstruct, there is no God and I'm really mad at Him. And so it seemed like that would have been a natural place for you to go with that. I mean, you talked about the direct encounter. Is that what you kind of chalked that up to? That's what changed the direction for you was pulling you out of that garage. If God is God, there's just going to be things He does that I can't explain. And it's not an excuse for, I'm not going to look into this. I mean, I've looked into it as far as I can. I've talked to some really brilliant people over the years and for God to be God, it's like Job says, I've heard of you with my ears and I've seen you with my eyes. I repent in sackcloth and ashes, right? And so I want to encourage people that God uses extraordinarily weak people. One of the things that encouraged me on in my faith as I would struggle is I got pointed in the direction of some biographies of some people. And I thought, gosh, God can use these people. I mean, like I highly recommend a biography by a gentleman by who it's a biography of William Cooper. It's spelled C O W P E R. He wrote hymns with Isaac Watts or Isaac Newton. No, wait, no, excuse me. John Newton. Okay. Isaac Watts, Isaac Newton, John Newton. John Newton who wrote Amazing Grace. But John was a companion to William Cooper throughout his whole life and William was constantly struggling from depression. But William has written some of the most beautiful hymns and glorious poetry that have ever come out of Christendom or Martin Luther's struggles or the kind of struggles that people had personally were always just very fascinating to me and very encouraging because it's not that people want to read a biography to see the strengths of other people necessarily. We want to know how these people did what they did knowing what we know about human nature. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The worst thing that we can do is to present people of the faith as superheroes. We're not. I think the greatest thing that I've discovered is to be honest, maybe my boss says I'm too candid about what I struggle with, but I think the greatest thing we can do for people and encouraging people is to say that it doesn't matter how weak you feel right now. Doesn't matter how unbelieving. You might feel it doesn't matter how dark the tunnel is before you. Doesn't matter if you can't speak or if you can't, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. God can do anything with you. You don't have to have a degree. You just have a, let God, Romans 12. You know, I was talking to a gentleman who struggled with suicide several years ago and we were both kind of conversing about what Romans 12 meant. If you want to die, then present your body as a living sacrifice. Just be alive. Stay alive and let God do what He's going to do. Yeah, totally agree with that. I think that's the depths of Romans 12. It's not just going up to the altar on Sunday. It's like, no, remain alive like the Bee Gees. Staying alive. There you go. Right? This is what we need to do because God can do anything. Where there's life, there is hope. And if all you can do is breathe, then just breathe for now. And God will be faithful in the task that He has called you because to me, it just seems like He picks the worst kind of people to represent His kingdom. And I mean that from a personal perspective, you know, there's a lot of other much more nice, more congenial, more gregarious. You know, the problem I used to believe early on in Christendom is that you become a Christian and then you become gregarious. That's right. You become an extroverted, likable, easy to deal with. Everybody has to be. You're going to be the door greeter at church or something. I'm like, this is still horrifying to me. But no, no, God doesn't have to. Some people, He does radically transform. Some people it's a gradual transformation. Some people it's a slow, gradual incline. Some people it's a rocket ship straight up. And you know, we shouldn't compare ourselves to each other. Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 about the body, we all have different parts. But we generally tend to be, I want to be the eye. Look at how glorious His ministry is. No, that's not, you know. And I think that we get discouraged, easily discouraged when we look at ourselves and compare ourselves to other people and what God has done. We end be the wicked, we end be other believers, and we just think, I'm never going to do that. You know, I'm never going to be like that. And that's, you know, that's not the gospel. The gospel, the good news is that God can use you right now, right where you are, and knows where you are. And you know, Psalm 139. Choose you anyway. Yeah. Despite yourself. Right. Which I've been realizing that gives hope to other believers. Like it is a more realistic gospel because we've talked a lot about just how the particularly Southern Christian culture has a lot of appearances that often go with it of having yourself together and all those things. And it's starting to occur to me that having an authentic application of the gospel and being honest about who you are is not only humble and, you know, genuinely talking about the gospel, but it's also encouraging other people because you're not presenting a view of sanctification that is inaccurate and unattainable to other people that you're doing life with. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, you said it earlier. It's not sanctification isn't, we shouldn't think that it has a point of arrival in this life where you've completed the task and now I'm here and now I'm kind of bored, like spiritual retirement, you know, that I've arrived, done all my things. I mean, we talked to Mormons that are this way and with all due respect to our LDS friends, they've done their missionary work. I've done with that. You talked to adult Mormons, they're not evangelical about their faith. They don't go door knocking. They've done that. They've done a list of things that they do, but I think a lot of Christians check out too. I've done all that. Oh yeah. There's not much that I can learn anymore. One of the atheist podcasts that I was on after David's was with a gentleman, Robert Stanley. Great guy. We had a wonderful time. But Robert grew up in Southern evangelical culture and by the time he was 18, he self-admittedly said I was taught that I knew everything. Not like as at an 18 year old, he knows everything about the world, but at 18 he got the distinct, he graduated all the Sunday school, did all the church things, went on Wednesday night, Sunday night pizzas and everything. But by the time he hit a wall in college, because it was clear that nobody had shown him anything about what he said. So it was like, I'm 18 and I know everything there is to know about God. And he's like, that was a huge turning point for him. To be given that, even if it was indirectly, the idea that you've graduated high school, you've been a dutiful church attender, now go out into the world and do great things for Jesus, you're just setting up a deconversion environment by doing that instead of preparing them and being honest with them. Because he's watching the adults in his life, what are they doing? They look like they're on a spiritual cruise. They've gone to a Florida retirement village, theologically speaking, and they're just kind of kick back, relax and making sure that their son or daughter is going to do the same thing. And there's no real world rubber meeting road. And usually when that happens, it's a bloody mess. Some people survive it, some people don't. The thing that I have found most refreshing and sometimes I don't get invited to all the parties because I'm honest sometimes about what I struggle with. So what? I would rather people be encouraged by me being honest than me being fake at rubbing shoulders with people that are not being honest with themselves either. And that's another one of our other things that we keep running into is people whose faith can survive when it's the flesh that hits the road. Because I think that's the part of the lie that we tell unintentionally that we imply to people is that that won't happen to you. If you're a Christ follower, your car is never going off the road. Demons will leave you alone. You'll never have any problems. God will come down, shower you with money whenever you're out of cash. When you're sick, you'll walk out of the hospital. That doesn't fit with the New Testament that I see at all. But I think what sets people up and instead when we... Because we've done it two or three times here at different times, I've asked people to stand if they're on psych... Like, hey, if you're on any psychotropic medications for depression or anxiety or whatever, if you've been a counselor in the last year for emotional issues or relational issues, go to that list. Like, okay, all the people who fit that list stand. Of course, 80% of the people in the church stand. And for some reason, everyone's shocked. And then if I say, and by the way, all of you are depending on sugar or caffeine or nicotine to stay alive, you stand too. And then there's like three guys out there and you're like, and those of you who have a problem with lying, y'all three now stand too. And they don't stand up because they don't have a problem with lying. No problems whatsoever. Exactly. But still, yeah. That's the reality is when you set people up to believe, I actually was... I have now in the last couple of years been uninvited from two different things. One was training counseling students here in a local college because the way the counseling center that I run operates is apparently not woke enough. For 15 years, so we've not changed our views. And by the way, neither has the school in 15 years. But it was okay to present both sides to the students. It was okay with me and apparently it was okay with them. And they actually came and told me, we're no longer okay with our students hearing there's another theory about these things. Wow. And so again, we talked about how free... I'm not sure free thinking means the same thing to me. That's not free thought. But the other one was a Christian organization. It's supposed to be training leaders in ministry at a camp many, many, many, many states from here. And I went and spoke there and they wanted me to teach the second half of Romans. But they uninvited me because I taught that women's role in ministry was a complex conversation as presented at the end of the book of Romans. And that got... Not that I said, this is the right answer, this is the wrong answer, but that I said, this is a very complex conversation. And Paul really throws a monkey into the wrench, so to speak, with Phoebe. And that now changes the conversation. We have to take a whole new tone. And isn't that fascinating? There's one sentence from Paul can have us go, oh, wait a minute, we got to look at this. And that, that I did not teach, women should have no role of leadership in the church. So it's like either end. And I said, so you'll know you're both setting up your students to deconstruct what you're trying to indoctrinate them with. And you bring up a point, Chris, that I think is, I hear all the time in deconstruction stories, is the one Bible verse that triggered something. I had a gentleman who, he was an atheist, we shared astronomy interests together, we had lunch together, and he was telling me what triggered his deconversion was a verse in Galatians about Abraham and the seed of Abraham. And you think it's not, if you're leaving, if you're jettisoning the faith on a verse or two, then really, I think that's indicative of the fact that you're not thinking thoroughly through the process. Whether you're weighing two issues, or whether you are deconstructing, if you're just basing it on a handful of verses from the Bible, that's going to be, that's an indication that we haven't drilled down to the specifics of what's really going on. And I think that's a key issue as well. But like I said, usually in that situation... In both directions. In both directions, right. People don't want to drill down to the foundation, they just want to find a reason not to believe anymore. And I think on the Christian side, we tend to create a theological environment where it's just built on a matter of a handful of Bible verses, and it's not a rich theological exposition of the whole text. That's right. Well, and I've even heard people say before, like, well, you know, theology isn't something that I'm into, or, you know, theology is not interesting to me, or I'm not a professional Christian, I don't need to study theology. And it's like, wait, no, we all have a theology. Like that is not something that you're exempt from. Nobody's not a theologian. Exactly. But it's like, are you willing to do the work of finding out what your theology is? I mean, we can talk about our favorite binge-watching Netflix movies. We know celebrities and their lifestyles, and we know our sports teams like the back of our hand, but we're not professional athletes. Why are we spending so much time on these things? If this is really important to you, no, you don't have to get a degree. But we are traditionally Christianity. Christians have been known as people of the book. People write, people read. Christians are, our God is a word-centered God. He's the logos. He spoke creation into existence. And to me, I think if we don't recognize and recapture the idea that we are a word-centered people, instead of an image-centered people, you know, God forbids idolatry, we need to be readers. That doesn't mean we have to be systematic theologians in a professional sense. If we're going to do a 1 Peter 3.15 and give a defense, it's not just about feelings. It's about theological reasons for why Jesus is Lord and why our lives center upon His. Well, and back to your point about being, I forget the phrase used, but retired. Retired because... Right. In retirement, Christianity in retirement. I think a lot of times it seems like that may be why we are inadvertently passing on a lukewarm or a weak faith to the younger generation. Because when we think that we've learned everything about God, it kind of mutes our relationship with Him. And it just dumbed that down of like, there's no awe. Perfect example. There's no wonder. Proverbs of the prodigal son. So we have this inheritance, our retirement, we're going to hand off to our generation, but we haven't trained our generation to appreciate what this inheritance is. We haven't given them. And so if we hand it to them, they just run away with it. And they end up in the sow pig feeding snows and everything. But yeah, we have a precious inheritance that we've struggled and strived for, and we think we've achieved, and we're not inculcating for these future generations of just how rich and wonderful and awe-inspiring, as you said, this inheritance is and how costly it was to God to provide this for us. And there's just no depth of appreciation that we are demonstrating in our own lives. And you don't have to be... And I feel like as an apologist with a Christian organization, I'm not here saying that you don't have to have this official position in ministry to be effective. You don't. You don't have to have a podcast. You don't have to be flashy. You just read books to your kids, read books to yourself, and no rightly divide the word of truth. And we have to know the word of truth and what it is. And I'm still struggling with that. I have to pray in a journal with my pen because I'm distracted. I can't... Same. I have to write out my prayers because it keeps me focused on what I... My prayers are still anemic and selfish. My knowledge of God is still... It's not arrived. And I don't want anybody to think that... I just have had these experiences that it seems to be that... And God can give each one of us experiences that will help other people. So your experience is just as valuable as somebody else's. You don't have to be a professional with degrees to make a difference for Christ. Yeah, that's really good. And I think it's good for people to hear that, to hear it isn't always going... You're not going to have simple answers for things. That doesn't make any sense. There's gonna be some tough things. There's gonna be ways you have to engage and wrestle. We don't get to be lazy in our faith. And it was something you were saying earlier. I don't know if you remember the old rom-com called IQ that was supposed to be like Einstein and his niece. So it's Tim Robbins, Walter Mathau, who plays Einstein. It's a worthwhile movie. Anyway, probably the classic Tim Robbins is a car mechanic. And Walter Mathau playing Einstein is trying to tell him how to romance his niece, who's played by Meg Ryan, if I remember correctly. There's a great scene where they're walking down the side of the road and suddenly Walter Mathau turns and says, are you sinking what I'm sinking? And Tim Robbins is like, what are the chances of that being true? Not likely. And so I think we would all get that about Einstein. And yet there's something in us that thinks my brain should easily comprehend everything that God would do. And somehow he should agree with me on the way I would do it. And we want God to be God when it comes to responsibility, but we don't want him to be God when it comes to authority or power, which those never are divided. And so I think it's great. And part of why we wanted to create this podcast was when we started it, there was that fad going on of this deconstruction among church people and podcasters. And it was like the new way to get their numbers up on YouTube almost. And so going this, it just felt, and I don't mean this for everyone who does this, but so often they would post, here's why I'm deconstructing. And I would go, that's just not good reasons. I think there are probably some valid reasons I could totally get my head around why someone would walk away from God. And just because you haven't read a book isn't a good reason. Like it's these issues they're bringing to the surface, you know, well, you know, there's multiple versions of how Judas died and you're like, okay, that's it. That was it. And that's because that's not hard. You want a hard one. I can give you some hard ones. That was not one of them. And it just, we thought we need to make sure people have the tools, one, to recognize deconstruction that I'm going, oh man, I don't, my faith is not the same as it was last year. Certain things have been removed or left or decoated, deconstructed, and other things have been constructed and reconstructed. And that's an ongoing, I assume, eternal process. Because if I can't, after 30 years, I don't still know everything about my wife. How will after eternity, I know everything about it. I'm an infinite God, much less another eternal person. And so I just, setting people free to recognize, one, when our instinct, and I know you've seen this many times, Dan, the instinct of people to panic when they hear a question they've not heard. I'm the worst of, I'm the most guilty. So chief among panickers I am. So when you get a question that's new to you and shocking to you, because I was that way for a while and now I just, it like almost makes my mouth water because I know there's going to be something very, very cool on the other side of it. And so I don't remember if I told you this, but I got asked by a Muslim one time, like the fact that Jesus would have spoken in Aramaic, but probably, and what we have is Greek. And there's certain things about the translation in Greek to Aramaic that just don't work very well. Like there's no specific participle, the, in Aramaic. And so how would John know that Jesus was saying, he is the way, the truth, and the lie? And so he threw these at me. And by that time, that was the first one that I remember going like, this is going to be so fun. I can't wait to see what the answers are to this because I doubt if you're first, I just don't think it's likely that you're the first person who ever asked this question. And even if you did, how cool would that be? And I think it's like living in El Paso. People are bilingual. They understood Spanish as well as English and could translate quite easily. Yes. John spoke both and apparently wrote, at least in Greek. And so yeah, John was there. He heard what Jesus said. And John thought the appropriate translation of that was the way, like it's not that hard. It's not a, it's not a good objective. The immediate instinct is to go, Oh my gosh, that's an excellent, I like that. I never thought of that. It's a great point. It's, it's not somehow a defeater. And so, but to go, that's fascinating. I, that man, I'm going to need to study that. I like, I like the objection, inspired airman's objection that the authors, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, not only are they not Matthew, Mark, and Luke and John, according to Bart, but the disciples were idiotes according to the Jewish council. That's the Greek word for basically from where we get idiot. They were unlearned, but they had been with Jesus. But Bart's argument is that whoever wrote the New Testament were not the disciples or in and around associated because, because the literacy rate of these people. So what Bart does is he goes and pulls literacy rates from the first century from the scholar who has written a book on literacy in ancient world. Yeah, I don't know that, but yeah. But the problem is, and I've made this analogy, the problem in saying that the disciples were illiterate and therefore they didn't write the New Testament is like citing the literacy rates from Mesoamerica 1000 AD to the civil war to conclude that Lincoln could not have written the Gettysburg Address. Exactly. For a span of a thousand years, there was all this illiteracy, but this proves somehow that Lincoln could not have written the Gettysburg Address. And these kinds of arguments, again, we're getting back to that idea of distilling down to the concrete specifics. When I have skeptics throw these historical objections at me, I say, well, what are your sources? Where are you getting from this? Because I'm somewhat conversant in the sources, but I want to pin down exactly from where are you getting this information? If you reject the scriptures as historical, fair enough, I'll grant you that. Let's look at your sources now and see if your historical criteria for the sources that you accept is consistent with the way you apply the criticism to the New Testament. And oftentimes it's not. Right. That's exactly right. So anyway, that's another podcast we could talk about. Well, I love this. I think it's great. It's for people to get to hear yet another believer who has wrestled, who's faced challenges, who has anchors that we return to, who's faced these things and who is honestly, Dan, an awesome resource. I love getting your newsletters and your podcasts. Oh yeah, you signed up for my blog. I forgot to mention that. Yes, yes, I did. And especially, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you, actually, I need to remember this from my son, Holland, who's big into, he loves astrophysics type stuff right now. That's a thing he's into. I need to get him connected to you. But if you're into that kind of stuff, Dan has got some great materials and is happy to, it does a great job of coming out and sharing it with churches and studies. Absolutely. And he loves doing that stuff. Does a great job. So Dan, thank you for your time today. Thanks for driving out here. Thank you. I'm sure God owes you a big one now. That's right. If you didn't hear the first hour, you need to go back and listen to that podcast. Okay, God, I need new tires for the car. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
