We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Legge alongside my partners in crime Bryn Starnes in studio and Chris Sherritt is joining us via Zoom in Montana. And you're saying that the weather is really nice up there right now. It's beautiful. Like yesterday, me and a bunch of these students up here that I'm teaching went for a hike and jumped off a cliff and just got in the water. It was very cold, but the weather is like low 80s. That's awesome. Yeah, it's really nice right now. Oh man. Goodness. And you're up there teaching. Good stuff. Well, thank you so much for spending a little bit of time getting with us to talk about, you know, just easy stuff. All the light and fluffy things. Oh yeah. Yeah. Bryn, can I throw it over to you? Sure. To kind of kick off our topic for today. Yeah. So we're still in the kind of the category of, um, is the Bible immoral by today's standards and just talking about different topical things in the Bible that are, are difficult to understand and often are roadblocks to people to trusting the Lord or trusting scripture. And so the next one that we feel like makes a lot of sense to cover is talking about violence in the Bible, specifically genocide or things that seem to be in line with genocide. And a lot of obviously mostly limited to the old Testament, but a lot of those passages that are really difficult to understand when it, when it comes to God calling Israel to wipe out a people or go in and, and kill people. And so, um, yeah, that's what we thought we'd tackle today. And, um, at least start the conversation of does the scripture condone genocide? Does God call for it? Things like that. So before we get into that, can I just jump in with like the definition of genocide? Because I think it's good to understand. Okay. What do we mean when we say when, when we hear the word genocide and then we can say, okay, according to that, is that what the Bible is actually doing? Yeah. Um, or saying, cause I know this is not an easy topic and we're, we, with, we were talking beforehand, the different passages, there are different genres of literature that we're looking at as well, um, within this. So trying to, trying to have the most accurate understanding, but according to Oxford dictionary, genocide means the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group. So that's that. So I guess if we're just opening up the conversation from that point of view, if, if Chris, if you're having that conversation, if somebody is initially saying, Hey, so, you know, you believe that God is this loving God, whatever, what is, how can he, let's cry or how can he just kill all these people? What, what, like, how do you gently have that conversation? What are the responses that you typically, or even like another question on that, that I've heard a lot is, um, that the God of the old Testament, the new Testament aren't the same, you know, like that because of that issue. But yeah. Yep. Yeah. And so I think there's a couple of things that I always try to do if I can, and that is to zoom back a little bit and talk about the whole, um, I think just kind of the bigger picture. And one of them is, um, is, is the God that you believe in, or maybe even the God that you rejected, because a lot of people say, like Bryn said, God's just God of love in the new Testament, God of wrath in the old Testament. Um, it's, it's both God is multifaceted, like a diamond, for example. And I think what a lot of people like to do is just camp on the attributes that they like, or they wish for him to have. And then the ones that they think are weird or yucky, or they don't like then, well, the God I believe in wouldn't do that. And that's nice of you to say, but I always have to go, but what are you basing the God you believe in on? Like if you're basing on scripture, you've got to be fair and not just cherry pick the verses that only talk about him being loving and merciful. You've got to also talk about he's also holy and he's just, and he punishes sin. And, um, sometimes that punishing of sin is death. And so what people get upset about also is then it's sometimes the punishment there is the taking of life and we're not supposed to take life. And so God's a murderer just like us. And I think explaining to someone, if God is the creator of all things, and he really is the sovereign God, it's not murder for him. Anytime he takes anyone home, I feel as the car accident to happen and somebody dies. Um, he decides when and how we get moved from this life to the next. Um, so that's the big issue that I would start off with is, do you believe that God has that right, um, to never cause any pain, to never judge any sin, to never do anything that you wouldn't agree with or approve of. And then when you start saying that sometimes, hopefully that sounds pretty obvious, like, okay, I'm being a little, you know what I mean? For them to see, like, you're just wanting a God that is basically you that he does everything you would do. And that's where you just go, well, then you're just worshiping a deified version of yourself. So I like kind of backing up and talking about what do you actually believe? And if God is all knowing and all wise, then he knows, um, all things and the depths of sin and the effects of sin, if it doesn't get stopped like a cancer, if he's all wise, he knows, um, how to best judge sin and how to do that and what's going to happen. And, um, he's consistent. And so that that's kind of my blanket thing. And in contrary to even that claim you mentioned, Ren, if you read the book of revelation, like literally 90% of the book is God's God judging the world. This is, so when people say the God of the old Testament is this way, the God of the new Testament, my answer would be like, have you read revelation? Like, yeah, it talks about how deep the blood is from this battle. Like it's, there's, there's death all over the place. Um, so I think that people feel like it's got to be either or instead of both and that God is loving, but he's also holy. God is merciful, but he's also just. So I think that's how I would start. And then I would do kind of what you already did there, Colson, I would, I would say define genocide for me because what do you mean when you say genocide? And that comes from the specific command to wipe out these people because that entire people group were doing these things. What a lot of people don't recognize is that God many times rescued people out of that culture. Like Abram was called out of early Calides. A Rahab was rescued out of Jericho before it was destroyed. Ruth, um, through Naomi was brought out of Moab, which is a really pagan country. So many times you see God bringing people out of that, but God's description on why, for example, the Canaanites were destroyed. And that's a very broad term if everybody doesn't know that's a very broad term for just the land. But then you hear about specific people, the all these otherites, being destroyed. But the reason I would say that this isn't genocide, it's judgment is because the exact same warnings are given to Israel and they ended up doing sadly some of the exact same things and they ended up being judged. Like the Canaanites were sacrificing their babies to Molech. Like they'd heat up this idol to, you know, white hot that had where its arms were white hot and then literally lay your live child to be burned to death. And the crazy thing is you read later on in the Old Testament and Israel was doing that. Solomon was doing that. Yeah. And so God punished his people. It's just God doing judgment, not genocide. So I think that's a big one to, um, to distinguish. And genocide is like a specific people group. Like when we think about genocide today, even it's like, right, this ethnic people group is being wiped out by this other. And like you're saying it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't God saying, Hey, this specific people just randomly yeah. So, um, that's, that's how I would start just explaining the difference there that God, God sovereign, God's judge, God can decide. And then God used Israel as his instrument of judgment, but it wasn't like he flew off the handle and was like, you know what, I'm sick of these people this morning. Go out and wipe them out. If you read all the way back in the book of Genesis, God gave Abraham a, a, a, a prediction really of what was going to happen to the people in the land. He basically said in 400 years, I'm going to give them 400 years, the time of their, their full reckoning isn't here yet. Um, because the, he says like the, the height of their evil hasn't reached its something, right? Yeah. Um, they're not evil enough to destroy. Right. Yes. And so, um, that that's an example there where God gave a long time, give them, you know, plenty of time to repent. Um, yeah. So, and then even the book of Jonah, we talked about that earlier. Yeah. But like Jonah, um, was upset that God sent him because he didn't like the people that God was sending him to. They were obviously a ethnic people group or, you know, country that he didn't like. And they were really evil. Like if you go into even the history of Nineveh and all the things that they were doing, it was like pretty gruesome. And Jonah was like upset that God was having compassion on them. And yet, you know, we see God go to these great links to send Jonah. We often focus on Jonah in this story, but it's interesting to turn and look at like, no God, this is also showing God's compassion to Nineveh. It's not just about the fish, you know, and, um, and he's sending them saying like, Hey, or sending Jonah saying, Hey, I want to warn these people before I destroy them and give them a chance to turn. And Jonah's like, Oh, you're just a God of compassion. Like if I go, they'll probably turn and you'll, you know, you'll probably forgive them. Yeah. I hate that. Yeah. You know, see in that story, what you're showing there, this is exactly what we're saying. God is holy and he's going to punish sin, but he's merciful and gives them a chance to repent. And so he's both, he is very serious and he's telling him, I am going to destroy you. And, and he's giving them the warning. In other words, he could have just destroyed him, but he sent Jonah. It's the first time by the way that God ever sends a prophet to another country. And Jonah had, I mean, it's hard to tell all of his motives. They were enemies of Israel. He probably hated them, but also probably feared for his life because of what he knew they did to other people. But still they end up repenting. And you're exactly right that Jonah ends up basically quoting Exodus 34 saying, yep, there you go. Being true to character, God, you're merciful. So he's not, yeah, he's not just one or the other. He's both. Which is also kind of cool that it was understood that God was just, but also compassionate even then like Jonah understood that about like, we all know this is the character of who you are. Yep. Even in the Old Testament. Yeah. I think one of the, one of the times that I know this has come up some is when people have talked, as Christians have condemned Islam and how Muhammad fought in, in Jihad and stuff like that. And a lot of the things that are clear in the Quran. And they've said, well, you Christians, you know, in the Bible, it talks about that as well. And I like to point out the distinction between a blanket allowance that whenever you meet an unbeliever, you can kill them if you want, versus this is a specific instance when I am sending you to be my, my, you know, my instrument of judgment. And I think that's where, I mean, that's a big distinction to make that, that God is in one instance, Allah is just saying, yeah, you can lie and wait for them. You can fool them. You can ambush them if they're unbelievers versus God specifically commanding Joshua. And again, it's a different time, not to say that God has changed, but we just have a hard time understanding war like situations anyways, because we just, it's so far removed from us, but it's, it's a very specific command and God is telling his people to drive them out. Cause you, this is the land I've given you. And, and yet you've got all of these provisions in the old Testament law for, but if a foreigner wants to come and live among you and follow the God of Israel, like that's fine. And so it's a matter of, I am trying to, a lot trying to prevent the land from taking you the people's culture to assimilate you, you can assimilate them. But if you let them assimilate you, and he knew how weak they were. So that's why he told them don't intermarry with them. And if they did, and that led them away. So it was a very like take or be taken, like war like culture, right? Of like, right, push them out, then they will, oh yeah. Yeah. And it's the same thing with God forbidding intermarriage in the old Testament. It was not racial, like the genocide idea. It was religious that he knew these people are going to lead your hearts, you know, astray. But then you've got examples of Boaz marries Ruth. So it's not bad in the sense that she wasn't pulling him down, but God generally was saying, you guys are just really weak, and they're going to lead you to worship their gods. And that's exactly what they did. And then adopt all the evil practices that totally they were saying. And it's cool, because even like Rahab and Ruth, both were non Jews who ended up following the Lord and then end up in Jesus's lineage. Exactly. Love it. Yep. Yeah. So another thing that we've kind of talked about that I would bring up, and that is if someone is a full blown relativist, and they're complaining about this, I would go on, on what moral standard are you saying this is wrong to come in and wipe people out? So you don't know what I'm saying? Like the only way that you would have any moral sense that this shouldn't happen is if you believe in some kind of moral standard, but if there's no God, you've got no moral standard, you know, it's like it's like a common accusation of like, why doesn't God, you know, stop evil in the world, but then you've got God stopping the Canaanites from sacrificing their babies. And now people were complaining. It's like, do you want to stop evil? Or do you not want to go to stop evil? Like, when he does, well, it's how he got how he stopped with him. It's like, okay, then you're trying to play God again. You know, yeah, I think it's like we talked about earlier, some episode that if we have an accurate understanding, so much like you're saying, it's beginning so much of this does go back to having an accurate understanding of God, because if we don't, and we already don't trust God and his character understand it, then a lot of this isn't going to make sense. It may not make sense fully anyway, but we will have trouble trusting that he knows what he's doing. Unless we trust God as a whole. And even in your own life, not just this side, it's like when bad things happen to you, you're going to be mad. Well, God's not supposed to do this. And it's like, well, what God are you believing in? Right. But also like the fact that we pointed out before that the fact that he is just points to the fact that he's loving, because an actual loving God, that didn't care about evil and sin and, and didn't care about injustice, like wouldn't actually be a loving God. So there, they have to be hand in hand. What about, I've heard it said before that some, and I hadn't heard this until recently, but some of the more drastic language is a lot of like war rhetoric or some, I don't know if it would be hyperbole, but what is it? What are your thoughts on that? Cause that's, I hadn't heard that before. And I thought that was interesting of, of like, did he actually mean wipe everyone out or was he, was that a phrase that people used in that timeframe or, you know? Yep. So I think that a lot of times people when they read the Bible don't, don't allow for that when they, when they criticize the Bible, or they don't think that people could talk like that too. Like if you're just saying how many people were at church on Sunday and you're like 300, like exactly 300 people. And it's like, no, but you know what I mean? Or things being an idiom, for example, Jesus being three days and three nights in the tomb. Like he wasn't three days and three nights in the tomb. You know what I mean? But it was, it was a Jewish idiom because any part of a day could count as a whole day. So everybody at the time knew that it just meant on the third day, but they still threw around that same language. And we do this all the time today when we say, you know, they were taking forever. Everybody was, you know, on their phone. It's like, you don't mean that you mean in general, everybody was, you know, there were a lot, there were a lot of people. There are a lot of people on their phone. Yeah. So part of that argument is, I think, seen clearly when God says to drive them out completely, or you've got these, these big blanket commands that sound so, you know, drastic. But then those same people that it says that they wipe them out show up again later in, in, in the story or in the Old Testament, which means they didn't fully annihilate them. They're, I mean, they're still there. So a good example of this, let me just read to you from Deuteronomy seven. Okay. If I could. He mentions, well, just turn to verse one, when the Lord your God brings you into the land that you're entering to take possession of it and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, Gurgishites, the Amorites, Canaanites, and the Parazites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than you. And when the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them. Okay, so devoted to destruction was a common phrase that was basically saying, you're going to do this completely. But this is what's interesting. It's, it's in a weird way, in the same way when God asked for the first fruits of the harvest, those were devoted to him. He was saying this is an act of that you're going to set it apart as an offering to the Lord, in a sense. It was more of that. The command also, and I think this is really significant in light of what we know happened, was to prevent Israel from this judgment being a motivation for personal gain. In other words, we're going to come in and conquer them. And I'm going to pick the best looking woman to be my wife. I'm going to pick, I'm going to take all their gold. I'm going to have the best house. Like, he's like, no, no, I want you to destroy all of this stuff and get rid of all this stuff because it's going to be an, it's going to ensnare you. And sure enough, if, if you read the book of Joshua, God said the same thing about Jericho, and Achan ends up taking some silver and going back to his tent and hiding it in the ground under his tent because he wanted to selfishly do this. So part of God's command mentally, what he was trying to get them to understand is, listen, you, again, I know how weak you guys are. You just see over and over and over again how weak they are, but he's like, just, you have got to get rid of them completely, drive them out completely. Now, here's an example right here where we know that, that could be an expression because literally the next same verse, he says, you shall not intermarry with them. So you're like, okay, you just said totally wipe them out. And now you're telling me not to intermarry with them. How can I intermarry with all these people if they're dead? Right. So even there, that's where some theologians have said, or thinkers have said, devote them to complete destruction just means drive them out completely. It doesn't mean you have to kill them completely. There's other verses that do say that. But in that instance, it's pointing out, the point is there in the very next verse, you've got, don't intermarry with them. Don't make a covenant with them. Like, I just don't want you to do this because here's what's going to happen. And you're going to end up serving other gods, which is the time of the judges, one of the darkest times of Israel's history is when they intermarried with them and didn't drive them out completely. Man. Okay. So I know that there are, you know, we can, we can go to different passages. What are, we kind of reference them as we were preparing for this, maybe some that are cherry picked out of context, specifically thinking about like Psalm 137, nine, or things that like people might pull out and say, Oh, well, the Bible says this kind of gruesome thing about killing people. I don't know what we can read that. Okay. Yeah, here, I'll pull it. I think, yeah, before you read it, I think that's a great example of you have to go back to context and understanding because yeah, some of these passages are really hard, but it's even more difficult if you're just picking it and not reading any of the verses around it. And yeah, I think Psalm 137 nine is one that people just pick and like, make memes about and different things about like, yeah, the Bible says this with no context. Yeah. Cause if you read it completely out of context here, I'll read it. It just says, blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock. And so yeah, clearly, I mean, there is more to this. Yeah, what Chris, you want to unpack briefly what you were just because I think it's a great example of like, people use this verse a lot to say like the Bible is violent and calls for violence without unpacking it more. Yep. So there is a category of Psalms, for example, that are categorized as imprecatory Psalms, where the author, a lot of times David is asking for God to do something on his enemies. And a lot of times it is violence, like he's asking him to do something. And so imprecatory Psalms are a just recording the honest feelings of what David is feeling right there. And he's asking like, Hey, Lord, this is what I would love to happen. Like, and again, with David, it's like, they're literally trying to kill me. Like, again, it's hard for us to relate to, what would it be like to be on the run? And our government has dispatched all of their resources to try to hunt you down and kill you. Like, how would I feel today about that? About these men, bounty hunters, all these other people that are out to kill me that I haven't done anything to these people. What would my in the midst of despair and frustration, what might I ask God to do? You know what I mean? Like, it's been real. Like, do you understand what he was feeling? It wasn't like David was in the middle of his, you know, of his palace playing his harp. And he's like, you know, I feel about my enemies. You know what I mean? Yeah. So in a pregatory Psalm is God is asking God to do that. And again, God's gonna do what God sees as fit to do. So just because we've said this before, the Bible records things it doesn't approve or doesn't just because it's recorded in the Bible doesn't mean like, that's now my, my verse, I need to tattoo on my, you know, arm or go by. So in this Psalm, Psalm 137, it's looking back on their judgment that came on Israel, really specifically Judah, where they're taken off into Babylonian captivity. And it's talking about what were things like when we were captives? And how did we feel? And so again, unless you've been ripped from your homeland and made to live in a country where you can't speak the language in your destitute and exile, it's hard for you to understand. But now it's looking back, okay, this is the way we were when we sat down by the waters of Babylon and we wept and all those things. And the attitude is, I want to go home. I want to see Jerusalem. It's like if I forget you, oh, Jerusalem is in verse five, let my right hand forget it skill. What's that song? Jerusalem, I forget you. What was that guy's name? You know what I'm talking about? It's a, it's a, it's a Jewish rapper type guy. What is it? Anyways, this is what he's quoting. Oh, you don't have to put that on the recording. Do we don't want to? I just thought we all knew this. Do we not all know this song? Matis. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds familiar. I forget how to say his name. Yeah. Anyhoo. You don't want to sing the whole song for us? Yeah. Okay. But he's referencing that. He's referencing that. Yeah. Okay. But he, even in this song, you recognize it's a song and it's a lot of poetic, drastic illusions. Like he says, if I forget you, let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth. If I don't remember you, you know, let my, my right hand forget it skill. Like it's, it's using this grand, exaggerated, like, like I really want this to be true. He doesn't really want his tongue to stick to the roof of his mouth. But then this is where the imprecatory Psalm comes in verses seven, eight and nine. He's asking the Psalmist here. We don't know who it was is asking God to remember what happened. That when Jerusalem was destroyed, the Edomites were excited. Like they rejoiced the Jerusalem's downfall and Babylon is the instrument. Babylon is the one that God used. And so they're just being honest. Like this is what we think. We think that Babylon should, should face what we face, that someone will be blessed if they repay you with what's been done to us. So again, I think I look at that and I just go, yeah, that's extreme. Like blessed, Shelby, he who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock. A that is not a therefore command that I'm supposed to go do. Yeah. And you see God all always, you know, talking about the sanctity of life. But also it's how they were really feeling in light of all that had happened to them where they were taken as slaves and judged and sold as, you know, property. Which is another reason why the Psalms are also powerful because it gives space and, you know, grace for us to be like that honest with what we're praying of like, yeah, whether or not this is right. Like this is how I feel right now, you know. Yeah. And we use phrases like, Oh, they're dead to me. Yeah. I don't know. That just came to my mind. It's like, what do you really mean by that? Like that sounds really harsh, but like, yeah. Okay, here's what I really mean. I'm just not happy with how they've been treating me. And you know what I mean? Like, yeah. So yeah, that's good. Okay. I don't know if I answered that one satisfactory, but there's, I think that's helpful. I think it's just goes back to what we have always talked about of just looking for context and doing sometimes the hard work of digging in. And that doesn't mean any of these things are easy all of a sudden. Right. I think that's one thing that is helpful to note that I think the Old Testament is complex and a lot of what God calls for is still can be confusing to us and still can be hard to understand. But I think if we do the hard work, then we can understand it more and at least understand how God is a consistent, faithful God who his character is consistent and can be the God of the Old Testament and the new, you know. Yep. And I think the problem that we have usually is it still goes back to even with the problem of evil is we just don't like how it happened. Like we just don't like that it happened. So the book of Habakkuk is an interesting example there where Habakkuk once in his name means to wrestle with and he wrestled with this idea that how Israel and Judah are declining, mainly, mainly Judah is declining. And he's wrestling with why isn't God doing anything about it? And then God tells him, I am going to do something and it's going to be Babylon. And then he wrestles with Babylon. How could you use Babylon? They're terrible people. You know what I mean? So it's like he wants got to do something. And then when God decides this is going to be my instrument, he's not happy with it. So it's the same dilemma of God is God and God is all wise. I'm not. And there's a lot of stuff that is going to be confusing to me that I just don't have the answer for and why he does that. So I know we're getting off on just the problem of evil in general, but with the genocide one, I would to sum it up, I would say it's not genocide is judgment. And then it's God being God deciding when people are going to leave this planet. And the ones about destroying some of them and even the children being killed. Some people have argued that is stopping the spread of the decay even further, because all of these kids were then growing up in that exact same climate and culture. And so either they're going to get killed or they're going to become just as bad or worse and carry on this stuff even further and further and further. And so it's an act of mercy to step in and to stop this cancer. And one of the ways is that is the way of the mountain. Now, depending on your theology about age of accountability, this would actually be if you think that God, you know, if a child dies before that particular age, where they fully grasp everything, the age of accountability, then then they're going to go to heaven. This is actually God mercifully stepping in. And instead of these kids being brought up in a horrific culture, like they really were far from innocent. They weren't these innocent people, a horrific culture that was just obsessed with sex and occultic stuff and sacrificing and everything. And even selling their kids for prostitution, for idol worship and crazy things like that. Right. So this would be this could be seen as an act of mercy to their souls for God to take them into his presence rather than have to live in this, you know, wicked, wicked environment. So anyways, those are my thoughts on that one. Yeah. And I think it's Yeah, I think it's one of those things that it's an easy thing to pick if you don't know much about God or don't have a relationship with God. It's an easy one to pick that that is a turnoff and is easy to just shut down saying like, well, I don't that's a, you know, that's like a horrible God or that in my estimation that whatever, but if you step back and study God as a whole, you know, it gives like you're saying, gives you a lot more trust for even the parts that we don't understand. Yeah. So that's why I, I want to sympathize with someone like, man, if you've had pain, I am so sorry. God is not apathetic. The Bible is not silent about that topic.
