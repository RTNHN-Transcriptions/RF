We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. And we think Chris Sherrod may be calling in at some point into this conversation, but we're going to get going anyway. And today we're talking about hermeneutics. Hermeneutics. Right. That's a big Christian word. Society of people named Herman. I don't know if I know anyone named Herman. This should be fascinating. This is going to be great. No, it is not. Bren, will you get us started off by kind of talking through the definition of hermeneutics? Because it's an important thing for us and it's valuable for our listeners to understand what hermeneutics is. Sure. Yeah. I can give a definition and then I think Chris has one also. But yeah, it's another one of those words that's even bigger than archaeology. So, but is very valuable to understanding just a Christian walk. And so we want to dig into it. But before we do that, hermeneutics is basically like the study and establishment of principles by which we interpret the Bible a way that I've heard it put that was helpful to me. We talk about worldview a lot and we explain worldview as like the lens by which we see the world. And then I, and then in my understanding is that hermeneutics is the lens by which we view and interpret scripture. So just like in worldview, if we have a wrong lens, it skews reality. Our view of reality in the same way, if we have the wrong lens by which we're looking at scripture, it skews that truth, our view of that truth. What is your definition, Chris? The one I use is that it is the art and science of studying revelation. Now that doesn't mean the book of revelation, this can all get confusing because the language is used in multiple ways. But the word hermeneutics actually comes from the Greek God Hermes, not Herman, Hermes. And he was the messenger of the gods. And so when we study hermeneutics, it's the techniques by which you would study any revelation that is allegedly from God, especially if it's in the past. And, and though we typically almost always hear about it in Christian circles nowadays, most often that may just be because we are Christians, but, but you would have a hermeneutical process for studying the Quran or the Bhakavad Gita or the Tao Te Ching potentially, if those are considered to the degree, those are considered holy books or holy revelation from a divine being. So, so it's just, it is the art and science of, of how you would properly do that. And that's obviously really important because people talk all the time about, well, when you say it's, you can make it say whatever you want to make it say. And, and, and that's not accurate, not, not, and be proper. That would be similar to saying you can say math, say whatever you want it to say. Well, you can, you just, you just be wrong. Yeah. Would you even say that even though most people may not say that they're aware of hermeneutics or even care about them, but we all are a proponent of like, we still believe something about hermeneutics because it, it reveals itself in the way that we teach or even our practice. And so even if we wouldn't say we're interested in it, we still ascribe to some type of hermeneutic. Yeah. I think it's kind of like theology. You can, everyone is a theologian. You may be a bad theologian or an undertrained theologian or a great theologian, but everyone has thoughts about God. And, and I think if you're at even at the baseline educated, you must have thoughts about holy writing and how you would use it or apply it. And it's all over the map, what people do. So anyway, what were some of the, did you, didn't you, when you were doing the research, you found some of the principles? Well, I was more, um, looking at different, different types, but before we do that, can we talk about why it's important? Like a little bit longer, please. Just because I think this is helpful for me and maybe helpful for some listeners. But, as I was thinking through it, I think one of the things that kept, and we've mentioned this before in the podcast, but I think one of the important things is, um, as humans and even more so as Americans, we come to scripture egocentricly and we come to it of, of like, this was written for me. The author was like me. What does this say about me? And I think hermeneutics is, is one of the important reasons that we need to study it is because, um, I think it, it helps us remember that that's not the case. Like scripture applies to us. It was definitely, um, God's word to us, but it is, it is not primarily about us. It's about God. And I think if we don't study hermeneutics correctly, it's easy for us to, to have a lot of skewed views of that, but that's one personally of like even viewing scripture egocentricly. And then, um, we misinterpret, misunderstand scripture. And then like we've talked about in the past from then, from that, we then start to misunderstand God and what he's promising to us. So I don't know, what would you say is one of the important, well, this is so I think way back, we studied epistemology in one of our reasonable faith, reasonable faith. I wish, uh, that's, that's Dr. Craig's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Go check out reasonable faith by a William Lane Craig. It's fantastic. Um, but reconstructed faith is, um, uh, is that there, there are five basic sources of knowledge of what is knowable or true intuition, authority, empirical evidence, reason, and revelation. Well, in the same way that empirical evidence, the scientific method has very specific rules. And if you break the rules, your results are untrustworthy. Um, and there's, I mean, the reason has very specific rules. And if you break those rules, you're going to end up with a false conclusion. Well, no different than that is revelation. And so we would call the scientific method, the rules by which you discover things through empirical evidence. Hermannewdix is the rules by which you discover truth through revelation. It's that important. And so if you're just, if you're just someone who picks up a holy book and you just start reading it with no concept and throwing truth out of it or throwing truth into it or making it say whichever you want to say, you're no different than someone who has no concept of the scientific method trying to run an experiment. You're just making stuff up is all you're doing. And so we need, we need to have an art and a science for how to understand revelation. It's that important. Otherwise. So we've gone through the limitations. When we did that podcast, we went through the limitations of each of them and human humans are kind of the limitation on each of them. There's nothing wrong with the laws of logic. We're just terrible sometimes at applying them. It's not that signed the scientific, the scientific method is not effective and appropriate. It's that we're not always great at doing it. We already have preconceived notions and when the results of our scientific study doesn't match that we don't like it. So we throw it out and try again. But how much worse when it comes to saying, this is what God says, how much more important, not less important is having an good understanding of the rules and guidelines. And there's some simple ways of coming at it and some really challenging ways you could spend a whole lifetime studying hermeneutics for our sake. Yeah, that's it's that it's that important. And it is scary to think how many people read and study and even teach things from the Bible. And they have no concept of the right guidelines and rules for doing that. And it's how we end up with amazingly bad teaching at times and heretical teaching and all kinds of things. And so what would you tell somebody if it was like that who had kind of the radical autonomy idea of like, well, wait, why, why should somebody tell me how to read this book? Why should somebody question, you know, why? Yeah, who says that these are the rules? Yeah, you know, and yeah, well, how would you address that? This is one of my favorites because one of the guidelines of radical autonomy thinking of expressive individualism thinking and we've talked about those on the podcast and how difficult those are to integrate into any type of rationality, but is everybody gets to define who they are and what they are except God. And that's seems to be one of the principles is, wait a minute, he doesn't get to decide if there's anyone who actually does have radical autonomy, it would be God. If there's anyone who actually has expressive individualism, it would be God. And he's the only person we don't allow that to. I think I think I may have even mentioned, you know, months ago in the podcast. I remember you saying that. Frank Peretti had that he had a talk called God's Way or My Way. I think there's the name of it. Okay. Years ago, like in the 70s. He's the author of the this present darkness, that whole series. And he, he didn't talk. He imagined some of you will be old enough, hopefully out there to remember Shirley Maclean. And she was part of the New Age movement. And she talks about going and standing on a beach and screaming at the top of her lungs. I am God. I am God. I am God. I am God. And Frank Freddie said he imagined God up in heaven going like, Wait, shh, you might hear anything. I think I hear something. What is that? Looking down through the skies and the Archangel Michael's like, Oh yeah, she's out there doing it again. Anyway, but if anyone gets to be, sorry, pretty does it so well. But if anyone gets to have radical autonomy, it would be God. So if you're going to respect other humans and say, listen, you get to define who you are and describe who you are. Wouldn't it be really important that you give God the same courtesy? Now, I don't agree with radical autonomy as a good cultural concept. Wow. But can you imagine how important it is that we follow God's rules for knowing God, that we have good. And if you want to get to know me, you need to follow my boundaries. We've talked about, um, if I asked everybody out there what kind of flowers I should buy, I'm going to buy my wife some flowers. What kind of flowers should I get her? I mean, everybody's opinion is equally worthless to me because I'm not buying them for you. The only value you could bring to me is if you know my wife well enough to know her favorite flowers. And God deserves that same dignity that we would say, okay, God, how would you want to be known? How would you want to be understood? And the principles that we see here actually are the principles for helping us understand what it is that God would want from us. And, and, and we need to have a way of doing that. And so he gets to set up the guidelines and he gets to set up some of these rules. And, and so I think, I think in revealing truth, he wants us to do it in a way that makes sense and that that doesn't put words in his mouth that aren't his words. And so that makes me extra careful with that. I always have to be that. So before we go into the guidelines or rules, can I, and then I'd love to ask another question, just playing devil's advocate. We're not even devil's advocate, but I know a lot of people think along these lines. And if there's someone out there, I would love to hear on their behalf. I have heard and read of people who ascribe to more of the idea that Christians don't need hermeneutics because they have the spirit to reveal God's word to them. So throughout history, I even read someone say specifically, quote, throughout history, Christians have read and understood, understood God's word without hermeneutics. What would you say to that? First, I would say no, they didn't. Or if they did, they risked doing it badly. Now that's a risk. So what I would say is not only did the Holy Spirit inspire the scriptures, but I do believe that he illuminates scripture. So I do agree that the spirit can give us insight and input through scripture that may or may not follow good hermeneutical principles. He's not, he is not restricted by hermeneutical principles. There are a couple of places where, for example, Matthew will quote a passage that as a preacher, I would not be willing to quote the Old Testament passage the same way he does because I don't think it follows great hermeneutical standards. But I'm not being inspired by the Holy Spirit. And I believe Matthew was now that's a, that's not universal. It's not a big problem. But there are a couple of places where Matthew, for example, quotes a prophecy in a place that I would go, huh, I wouldn't have thought to put that there. And even going and looking at it, I don't know that I would feel comfortable putting it there. So certainly the role of the Holy Spirit is real. The warrant of the Holy Spirit is real and isn't to be ignored. There's a wonderful story that Patsy Claremont tells in the book God uses Cracked Pots, in which she had been agoraphobic for years and years and felt like God was leading her to go speak and tell her story. And so agoraphobic meaning fear of open places, but literally, it actually applies as like the fear of fear, the fear of having a panic attack. So that's, you're anxious about being anxious. And so a lot of times those people get stuck in their house and they can't ever get out and because they're locked in. And so, so here she is. And she feels like God has led her to do this. So in with all the courage she can muster, she's actually getting on an airplane. She gets on an airplane to fly to this place where she's supposed to speak. And she's overwhelmed with anxiety, totally overcome. So she randomly picks up her Bible, opens it randomly to a spot in the Bible, points to a random verse. Now that is not good hermeneutics. That is a terrible way to study and look at scripture. And the passage she found was, behold, I will bring you to the earth. She was like, wow, God has just comforted me. Now I'm totally okay with the idea that the Holy Spirit took Patsy Claremont to that specific verse in that moment, even though she was using terrible hermeneutical principles. Now the story goes on. She told the story in the talk and a lady in the talk came up afterwards and said, that was really a beautiful story you took. What verse was that exactly again? And she said it. And the lady said, my translation says, behold, I will plummet you to the surface of the earth. So she had apparently found one of the passages where God is speaking to a prophet to Satan himself. Oh wow. And so, so she just took the verse completely out of context, completely terrible. And yet I'm okay with the thought that the spirit gave her what she needed in that moment through the illuminated word, or she got super lucky with what she pointed. And with the translation, because she had gotten plummeted. It might have been a little different response. So, so it's not that I think that the Holy Spirit is not a significant part of understanding and illuminating scripture. That being said, I don't think that's what we're called to. I don't think we're called to have a more superstitious attitude about it. It isn't that you can't have him reveal stuff to us, but we also know that throughout that same period of time, when some Christians have been illuminated supernaturally to something in scripture, that they even using bad principles, we have hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of examples of people using bad, coming to bad conclusions, because they used bad hermeneutical technique to reach certain conclusions. A lot of the time, the right criticism that Christianity has gotten throughout the years and sometimes gets today comes from bad hermeneutics. We probably would have avoided the crusades, if not for bad hermeneutics. We probably wouldn't have persecuted early science, some of the early scientists, if we had had good hermeneutics. We probably still would not be throwing out certain theories as anti-Christian, if we had good hermeneutics. I mean, there's so many examples of who's been persecuted. I mean, the Spanish Inquisition and the whole concept of witchcraft. I don't know what was going on back then. I wasn't there, but certainly some of it I can read as bad hermeneutics. The mistreatment by Christians of African-American people in America was bad hermeneutics, not pushing back against the Nazis in Germany by the churches, some of the churches. I think I could come up with this. I could sit down with my great-great-great-great-whatever uncle, Wade Hampton, who owned a thousand slaves, and I could sit down with him with his Bible and say, here's where you were wrong, Wade. Here's where you were wrong. I don't know how you felt like you got away with this, but it is clearly here in Scripture that you're not supposed to be doing what you're doing. And I suspect he would spout back to me the answers he was given by a pastor who was using bad hermeneutics. We run into it all the time, all the time. I've been talking a lot, but I know that's going to happen probably today. But it was one of those, I got stopped in the parking lot of Walmart by somebody who, I don't know why he decided I was the guy to have this conversation with, but to convince me that black people weren't human. And he was trying to convince him that. I don't know why he stopped me and decided, hey, this will be a fun conversation using only Scripture. And he went through like 15 scriptures as fast as I could take a breath, quoting stuff. And they were all over. Like he was linking one verse from Jude to a verse in Deuteronomy to another verse in Isaiah. And when he got done with his little monologue and stopped, and I was like, dude, I don't even know where to start with you. Like you have no idea how to read or study Scripture at all. You just broke every rule about this. You're just looking for keywords. You have an opinion and you've now pulled the nine verses in the entire Bible that taken out of context seem to defend your opinion. And I'm curious, like, have you ever read the whole book? You quoted Timothy. You ever read Timothy? Because I don't think it supports your view as a whole. You just randomly grabbed over and it was, it was like, I wish I could, I should have had him, should have recorded like, Hey, could you do that again for me on my phone? Like record what you just said? Because that was maybe one of the most beautiful examples of Isagesis of bad exegesis of bad hermeneutics. I've ever heard my life. It was, it was impressive. I'm trying to find it online and I can't find it. Wow. Man. I really feel like that's, that's one of the most practical, dangerous examples of what we're talking about is, I mean, definitely there's a lot of bad hermeneutics that lead to us being misled or misinformed. But I think probably one of the most dangerous is, is us pulling what we want to believe out of scripture. Yep. And making it say what we want or supporting our own thoughts. Well, what was the analogy you said earlier about the surgeon or something? When you're talking about hermeneutics. I mean, so when someone says, when someone says, well, the Holy Spirit can guide me to anything, I actually would agree with that. The Holy Spirit can guide you with anything. And we have the story of brother Lawrence who, you know, would, would do, he couldn't do math. He probably had a learning disorder. And so he would, but he bought everything for the monastery. So he would go to town with the money the monastery gave him and ask the Holy Spirit to guide him, which store to go to and what to buy and which coins to give. Cause he didn't even understand the denominations of the coins. Of course, this is all according to legend. I don't, I don't know that we know this for sure. And he always got the best deals because the Holy Spirit would guide him. He would literally count out coins until the spirit told him to stop. Not because he had no idea what the numbers meant. Allegedly. Now, so I would say, certainly if the Holy Spirit has the power to do what the Holy Spirit does have the power to do, you could do surgery without ever having been trained in surgery. If the Holy Spirit chose to move you and walk you through that process perfectly. Or land a land, a billion seven, 47 without any training. Which, but why would you, why, where is the difference between that and testing God? We were told very specifically not to test him. And for me to go, Hey, I'm going to go do this spirit. You better lead me. Or I'm going to kill somebody, or I'm going to kill a plane full of people. If you don't guide me, lead me like that's just testing the Lord and wrong. And I don't think that's any different than going to the Bible and going, I got nothing. I'm just going to, now again, I think like Patsy Claremont did that with a good motivation, the Spirit, because the Spirit can do whatever the Spirit wants to do, decided to, to comfort her in that. And I've seen examples, many examples of that in my own life as well. But you just, you don't, why would you depend on that when we have such good principles for how to study scripture and how to dig into it? And, and they're not not positioned. Yeah. Hermeneutics is not denying the work of the Spirit or somehow being like, we need to take this in our own hands. No, not at all. It's, it is complimentary with the Holy Spirit. All sources of truth should be complimentary. All, all efforts to find truth should be complimentary. When they contradict each other, that means you're wrong with at least one of them. Yeah. So he spent a decent amount of time talking about why hermeneutics is important for us, why good hermeneutics is important. And I really love what you were hitting on, like a lot of just these horrible things that have been justified by scripture. It just solidifies in my mind, and I'm sure in our listeners' mind, the necessity for good hermeneutics. Oh yeah. So can we, can we talk through like what those principles are? Yeah, you know, you're going to, okay, so here, let me go with the, there's a lot of ways to come at this. Okay. This is mine. Okay. And I think I'm stealing this from Dr. Howard Hendricks from Dallas Theological Seminary, who probably stole it from somebody else. My guess is something like this is what Christian leaders and teachers have been doing for a long time. It's a three step process. Observation, interpretation, application. So when you're studying holy writing, first thing you do is observe. Observe is done in the present time. It's done by me. So if I'm reading a passage right now, I am looking at what do I see? What am I experiencing? What am I seeing? What's in the passage, et cetera, right? That's observation. And you want to spend a lot of time there. What am I actually seeing? What's really going on? Who is in the, who is in this and who are the characters and what's the experience and that kind of stuff. So I'll tell you what, I'll look up a passage and we will, let's see. So we're going to, we're going to, in a minute, we're going to look at Mark four. Okay. And this is one of my favorite examples of something that many Christians have read, but now you're actually like, Oh, let's, let's look at it at a new level. Okay. And this helps us to see this, so this process, you know, we talk a lot about context. We talk a lot about reading, yeah, reading with the right frame of mind with the right lens. We've talked about that for a long time. This is the process that allows us to do that. So yeah, yes, this is right. In fact, you know, let's Mark four is great, but I'm, I think, well, let's have a little more extra fun and do Mark six just for extra fun. Mark six. So turn, if you're listening, turn your listening, you can turn your Bible to Mark six. We'll read it. I will, if you don't have a Bible, look it up online. Yeah. But yeah, sorry. There are plenty of lots of Bibles online. Okay. So that's observation. We just observe it. We look at it. We see it. We, we can talk about what I'm experiencing in it. It's done in the present time. It's my eyes, my ears, my observation. Then we go into the past and that's what interpretation is. Interpretation is what did Mark mean? What did Mark see? What is Mark experiencing? And what are the people who were there? So Mark wasn't there for this event that I'm about to read that we know of. And so it's going to be about the apostles and Jesus and what did they learn? What did they experience? Who, what were they, what was going on? What's the context they were in? When was this? What languages were they speaking? What did these things mean to them? Two thousand, in this case, this is 2000 years ago, approximately 2000 years. What did these mean to them? And in order to do that, this takes a lot of work. And so we need to know what things mean to them, what things mean versus what things mean to us. What type of language was this? We've talked about observation, for example, and observation interpretation overlap quite a bit. They kind of say a way into each other. So for example, we've talked parts of speech or genre. What genre am I reading? That's an observation question. What is this narrative? Is this poetry? Is this history? Is this revel? Is this like, prophetic? Like all of that, those are not always easily done. But that's an example of one that's super, super important. You have to know what part of speech you're reading and not even just the genre of literature, but even the phrases that are used. What is this? Because Jesus spoke in hyperbole at times. Jesus told jokes. Paul tells jokes. Paul speaks sarcastically. There's multiple places where Paul seems clearly to be speaking sarcastically. Well, that's sometimes hard to read in a document written 2000 years ago in a different language from, you know, five or even in historical books, you know, some narrative is like, there is hyperbole used to illustrate a question that's like, but for us in our mindset, it's like, if we don't put ourselves in their shoes, we don't understand that. And so there's a lot there. Even today, if you're in another culture and you're asking if you have a translator and you're telling a joke or you're being sarcastic, it often doesn't translate at all. Think about it. So we go to the Dominican regularly. Do you remember some of the things that are different between their culture and ours that often catch Americans off guard? I'm trying to think. I mean, like other than like pace of life and they are less sarcastic. Is that right? Like much less sarcastic. Yeah. They'd be much more likely to take something literally. Literally. Yes. At face value. Yeah. There's some funny little ones. Like for example, they point with their lips, not with their finger. And so you've been in a conversation with somebody and they reference the store and they're doing something funky with their lips. And you're like, what, what is what's going on? They literally, it's a little bit rude to them to point with their fingers. So they point with their lips and, and they wrinkled it and see it, but Chris is trying to do it with my lips. And so, uh, they could totally throw it or they wrinkle their nose when they're confused. That one threw me off for a while till I learned that one. They'd be wrinkling. And so I actually made a faux pas down there with them when I was talking to a kid and trying to speak Spanish, which I'm not very good at. And he was wrinkling his nose. And actually in the moment was like, Oh my gosh, you're doing the nose thing. Oh my gosh, you're doing it. I've wanted to see somebody. He's like now, now he's totally awkward. Just four kids. Like now he's watching me do my nose. Like I'm so sorry. That was so, so a noob of me. Um, anyway, so yeah, there's huge differences. And we're dealing with an ancient culture here by our standard. Yes. 2000 years ago. And, and so often they are interpreting a culture from 2000 years in their past, the writing of Moses. Right. And so you literally have Matthew 2000 years ago, often interpreting Moses who was 1500 years to 2000 years before, before, before Matthew. And anyway, this is, this is, that's why you need a science and an art to deal with this. Now some people hear that and like, Oh man, I could never do it. No, no, it's not, it's, it's not everything means it's not possible at all. In fact, it's so much more fun. And so you can read, I'm going to show you how you can read it at one level and get it and love it. And then when you do good hermeneutic, you learn something new that's so cool. So, well, the other, the other thing I wanted to tack onto that Chris, before you jump in is the fact that we have so many resources are at our disposal right now with the internet. It's like, you were just talking about how attainable it is. It's like, man, it really is. It doesn't take that, like you don't have to go to the library to dig deep into things. So yeah, that's, that's great. You do have to be careful that the website you're reading has good hermeneutics. True. True. A lot of trash for that caveat. I'm a big fan of Bible hub, by the way, Bible hub uses, you can type in any passage, like I could type in Mark six 30 commentaries in Google right now. And probably the first link would be Bible hub. And it would have six to 12 commentaries side by side about that verse. Wow. And they're not all going to agree with each other, but they're all going to have good principles. Right. And you're, you're able to kind of compare and contrast right there. Right there. I love it. It helps me. I don't know how people preached before. Yeah. I'm imagining, you know, John Redfern's dad with like nine commentaries on the table. And not commentaries are bigger than Bibles. And so crazy, like I can't imagine you can't, and you can't like search a keyword. Yeah. I cheat in a thousand ways. Okay. But anyway, let's, let's jump, let's jump into what you were saying though. So observation and then interpretation is going into the past and understanding them, what they meant, their context, their truth, the truth that they were trying to reveal in the way they were writing. And so that's key. What, what, what were the truths that they were, the cosmic truths they wanted to reveal in this. And then you come back to the present with application, which is, okay, what do I do with those truths? What do I do with what I've learned? How do I then live? How do I apply that understanding back to me in the present time? So, so for example, one of you guys want to read, um, oh man, it's, it's 14 verses, but I feel like we'd be cheating if we did anything less than that. Um, yeah. When we do those 14 verses, 30 through 44, Brenda has a great, uh, reading voice. You go, Brent. Okay. Mark, what is this? Mark six, 30 through 44, 30 through 44. Mark is a great book for her musical study, by the way, because he's very particular with his words. And it is probably, he is actually using sermons to create this work. So he was probably Peter's note taker. And so Mark wasn't there for most of these events, but he was taking notes on Peter's teaching. Well, Peter is teaching in an effort to reveal certain truth about Jesus. So he's teaching what happened, but he's doing it in such a way to reveal truth. Um, and so a lot of times you can, you can unpack something in Mark and it's just, it's just like we're about to do. And you just go, wow, wow. There's two levels here going on here that being good, having good hermeneutics allows me to experience. That's cool. Okay, go ahead. Okay. Mark six, 30 through 44. The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them, come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while for many were coming and going. And they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. Now many saw them going and recognize them. And they ran there on foot from all the towns and got their head of them. When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, this is a desolate place. And the hour is now late. Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. But he answered them, you give them something to eat. And they said to him, shall we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat? And he said to them, how many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they had found out, they said five and two fish. Then he commanded them all to sit in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups by hundreds and by fifties and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all and they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up 12 baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. And those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men. There you go. Very, very famous, well-known story account of Jesus feeding the 5,000. So let's observe. What do you see? What stands out to you? What seems odd or out of place? What seems specific? So who do we first, who do we have? The apostles or apostles. Good. Probably 12, all 12 of them. Okay, good. Or at least a bunch of them. Apostle means sent by the way. So these are his handshosen who we often call the disciples. Okay. We also have Jesus. They just came back and were reporting to him. Okay. So they've been out ministering, come back to make a report. Good. People are noticing that they're together and a crowd is gathering. Yep. All the people following these apostles from wherever they went, they've now all been drawn back to this central place where they're meeting up with Jesus. It's a pretty visual picture. It paints a really good picture of the setting. Yeah. Especially if you've been there, you can actually picture where this is happening on the north side of the sea of Galilee, probably hillsides going down to the sea. Anyway, good. I love when it says he came ashore and when he saw them, he had compassion on them. So it kind of indicates like this. He maybe he's tired. Maybe he's thought that there were some other plans in in place, but then he had compassion on them. And it seems like he made a decision at that point because he sees that they are like sheep without a shepherd, which is just a cool picture. And which you can imagine because it, I mean, to interpret a little bit, let's just head a little bit. He went across the sea of Galilee to get away from these crowds. Right. He took a direct route straight across. They ran around the whole thing to meet him where he is. And the sea, by the way, a sea just means a body of water you couldn't swim across easily. So it's like a lake. It's like a Texas lake. It's not that huge. But to run around it would still be. Yeah, you're still probably talking eight miles that they just, you know, six to eight miles, they just ran around to go get there. I can look at real quick. Keep going. Good. The slow ones are telling the fast ones, save my spot. I'm going to catch my breath. Good. Yeah. Okay. Keep going. What else do you notice? Well, they're hungry. So it's okay. Good. They just ran eight miles. Yeah, of course. They're hungry and they're not in a spot where they can get food easily. So they, the disciples don't have enough food to feed them. And so they want to send them away to get food. It's interesting. It mentions the color of the grass. Chris shared is wanting to join. Should we, should we add him right now? Let's wait a second and go through, let him know. We'll wait a second and then we'll get him in. Okay. Good. What about the color of the grass? Green grass. Isn't that weird? Yes. I thought that was a good observation. You're like, wait a minute. Green grass. What is that about? I mean, grass is green, right? Is this telling us the season? What's the point of that? Yes. What do you think? Also it's green grass. Yeah. Well, and there's not a ton of grass there, right? Oh, I got to depend on the season. Yeah. It depends on them. Okay. They're in a desolate place. Interesting. They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. Okay. So someone did someone direct them to do that? Is that just cultural? So he has them sit down in groups. Good. And he does what for them? He divides the food. Well, blesses the food. Right. He gives them, he blesses the food and then he feeds them. Good. And they're right by the sea of Galilee. And they're sitting in the green grass. Yes. And what does he say when he gets off the boat? He says you give them something to eat. What does he say that what does he say to himself? This is a desolate place. Good. The hour is now late. Yes. He saw the, what did he see about them? That they were hungry. Okay. Good. That they're like sheep without a, without a shepherd. So he has them lie down in the green grass and he prepares a table for them by the still waters in a desolate place. Wow. So when you observe well, this passage, what you discover is that Peter through Mark's writing is revealing that Jesus is the shepherd of the 23rd song. It's important that the word green is in there. That's probably meant to be the word that makes you go, wait, uh, where have I heard that? Where are green grass and where are they in a desolate place? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths. They just ran all the way around the sea, which by the way is more like, we don't know if it's all the way around. By the way, he just went to it. Anyway. Wow. I actually haven't heard that. Yeah. Um, you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. It's really goodness and goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. I don't dwell on the house Lord do forever. So what's cool is you read this story and it's a beautiful story audience would know that a Jewish audience would pick up probably almost immediately on this lesson that he's teaching. Um, Mark is filled with this kind of stuff and only, but you can only know it. Like you've presented, y'all probably heard me teach to the woman with the issue of blood, this, this cute little story about God, about Jesus healing a woman who's, who's been on her period and it's never stopped probably. But when you hear the whole thing unpacked, you're like, Oh, when you understand the whole Jewish context of that era, you understand what's going on. You see the significance. Why would she sneak up on him? Why the man lowered through the roof, for example, or the one I was going to read about. So one of the ones I love is is the Jesus still in calming the sea. Again, knowing how that works is important, but people read it and the first time ever they realize there's a bunch of boats around and it's at night. Most people don't picture this calming of the sea at night and that there's boats everywhere. And how scary it would be to be in a storm in the dark with boats smacking all around like wooden boats, wouldn't barely wooden boat. We've seen the, it's like glued together pieces of cardboard, how terrible their boats were on the sea of Galilee. But man, all of a sudden, the whole story comes to life for you. And you're able to see it in a way that didn't make sense before because of the good hermeneutics. And you're able to spot the story sometimes that's going on even behind the story. And that's not just Mark is one of the greatest places to do that because it's so it's near the surface for those of us who are pretty new at it. Yeah. But we're talking about the Bible project guys, for example, that's what they they are trying to do that with I mean, they're in the Leviticus now. Right. And so blessings on them. But the for trying to really unpack Leviticus like that, but they do they go into the what they're doing and other speakers and teachers are now doing more and more than ever is diving into the correct observation and then moving into correct interpretation understanding. Yeah. What are we dealing with? What are the genres, etc. And what's the form of speech? What's going on here? And you if you have to observe until you're you're just weary of observing, and then you've got to start the research. And again, you could read that story a thousand times and love it and learn about it and and be blessed by it. And and it's not a bad thing. And then if you take it to the next level, and you do some study and research, then you can discover, wait a minute, there's there's something else going on here. And and it's really cool to get to study deeply into Scripture like that. And and understand that Peter isn't just talking about that that time when Jesus fed all those people. He's also revealing what that says about Jesus, that he's the Good Shepherd. So what an inspiring reason to want to study hermeneutics, right? Just so that my understanding, I mean, my understanding of Scripture and God is enough of a reason. Yeah, right. But also just understand, like my love of Scripture will grow and my understanding of God will grow. And if I don't dig into this, at a minimum, my understanding may be limited. And when it could be so much like understanding Scripture, even deeper and the more beautiful story that it is, it's just really inspiring. Isn't it isn't it? Isn't it so us as Christian as humans, but sometimes as Christian humans, that that our main motivation for not our main motivation for something like hermeneutics is to not do it wrong, right, versus recognizing, no, there's also this great gift waiting for you when you do it right. There's this really cool thing that's going to happen as we get to unpack this in new ways and dive into it and really study it and see the depths of it is why people have spent, I mean, thousands of millions upon millions of hours writing and studying and digging into this. And it's just fascinating. It is such a that's when I see the living value of God's Word is that it is living, it is active. I could teach the same passage 20 times in a lifetime. And it's the same basic truth, I will learn and grow, I may get to go to, you know, 201 and 301 and 401 class level of it, the more I study it. But again, the revealed truth is still there at one level for everybody. And, and you don't want to, yeah, you can make mistakes, you can study it badly or poorly or toss this out or throw it away for whatever reason. But man, I just think I think when we observe and then how do we so the application we say, Hey, what do I do with knowing that Jesus is capable of providing at this level? He doesn't promise he's always going to do this at every he doesn't go around. In fact, the next chapter is him telling people are soon after this is him essentially confronting people like you're just following me around because you want food. Right. And so I'm not going to give you any more food right now. So it's not that he promises, he's not just the master gravy train caterer, it's there's more to it. So what does it mean that he's the shepherd? And then I can begin to study what does it mean to have a shepherd in my life? Yeah. And, and it's a powerful picture. So anyway, I mean, that I'm a sheep. Yeah. And yeah, that too. Exactly. What does it reveal about it? I actually was going to say, what you said earlier, that God's word is about him. And that is true. And what he reveals about us is part of that. And so yeah, that he is a shepherd means we get to be sheep. So yeah, thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
