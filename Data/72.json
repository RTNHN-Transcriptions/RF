We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Legge and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime Bryn Starnes and Chris Legge. Continuing our politics theme and series, we're jumping into the topic of politics as a religion. I know that this can be strongly, I know probably anywhere in the country. I know we live in the South and so you can see this play out in a lot of different ways. But Chris, when we bring that up, what's kind of the first thing that pops in your head? What's on your mind when you hear that politics as a religion? You know, I'm so I'm about 50 and I just don't remember. Give or take. I'm 50. So I'm exactly 50 right now. I'm exactly 50. I'm sorry. I was watching Benedict Cumberbatch in an interview. It was like, I'm somewhere over 30. My problem is I'm actually, I mean, I'd have to sit down and do the math. I think I'm exactly 50. Like I think that's right. Sorry, I could be wrong. I'm 50 ish. I just don't want to be lying if someone's like, wait, you're 53. I'm okay. Fine. I don't know something. Past a certain age, you stop counting. Or you can't count anymore. One of those. So I don't remember ever at a time in my lifetime, politics having a religious edge to it that it does seems to in the last, say two administrations. What do you mean by that? I just, I feel like there is a religious devotion by members of both sides of the political aisle to their political agendas, to their political candidates. They have to deny anything that would be negative about their candidate. It's like it doesn't exist, no matter how obvious it is that this is a huge raging flaming in your face, bright spotlight problem. You go, nope, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. And it makes me feel like people who are involved in a false religion, you bring up certain topics and they scream you down. They don't, they don't debate it. They don't discuss it. They just scream you down. You're just a hater. You gotta, you know, how dare you? You must, and they label you. And, and, you know, maybe, maybe 20 years ago, that would have made sense. I know that in America, this may not be worldwide, but in America, the left side of the aisle has moved more quickly away from Christianity than the right side of the aisle. I don't know that that's authentic or sincere. It's just overt. And by 20 years ago, you mean early 2000s? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As we start, that became more, I mean, it started further back than that, but we started seeing that more clearly. And, and so I'm not surprised. I wasn't surprised when on the left side of things, you started seeing more of a religion of politics, because if you don't have religion to play certain things, a religion is supposed to provide certain things, hope, purpose, relationship to God, deeper meaning. And I mean that as a study right now. Yeah, exactly. Those things. And so, I mean, and, you know, purpose and whatever, doctrine, picket, sacraments, worship, you know. And so, if you veer towards humanism, well, it makes sense that you would then begin to place politics and religion would become hazy. Yeah, that seems like a natural step. It does. Because politics becomes a tool. Right. That makes sense. And those are the men in power. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. The men and women in power are ones you can trust and say, hopefully, you can, you're putting your trust in them to save you. It's a, what's, who's going to save us from now pick the topic, the whatever the, and, and one of the things religion has to do is offer you an answer to what kind of crisis is it a, it's not esoteric crisis, what's the word, existential crisis. So religion, one of the most important things religion does is it gives you solutions to existential crises. What happens when I die? What happens when we die? What happens when everything ends? Like those are questions that religion offers answers for. Well, why am I here? Sure. Yeah, exactly. And so if you don't, if your religion, if you don't have a religion to answer those, then where do you go? Well, it makes sense that you would say humanity is what you're trying to protect and who can protect humanity. Well, since there is no God, it would make natural that you would get lean towards human efforts like politics. That didn't surprise me, of course, according to the, along that transition. And I'm sure there are people on the left, there are many, many, many people, maybe the majority of people, I don't know, on the left who, of course, they're still religious. And of course they believe in a God and they, that still represents, I don't know what the number is, 92, 93, 94% of the population still claim God at some level, or some type of, you know, God. So, so that's that I'm not trying to paint a big lump. It just wasn't surprising me to see that. I was surprised to start seeing on the right side of the aisle, a religious devotion to political candidates and political movements and politics in general, because, so I guess, I guess the idea here is that conservative thought no longer is able to successfully connect people to the faith of their fathers, so to speak. And instead, they've got to create a new religion. And again, it seems like they're looking to political leadership and people on both sides now fight the fight the way religious, religious disagreements used to happen. And it's becoming more and more volatile, more and more even deadly that people disagree on politics and they kill each other. And that's always happened. But anyway, I'm doing a little monologue here, but that just, that just struck me as significant. And how, how offensive to any young person who's especially a young person who's been watching the church. And when a church begins to align itself politically, it feels like, okay, so our faith is in Jesus and fill in the blank. And, and so Jesus can save us, but he's not going to elect the kind of Supreme Court judges that I want. So I want, like I'm putting my faith in Jesus and this political leader and Jesus and this, and you know, who's gonna, who's gonna save my soul? Jesus, who's gonna save my country? Oh, it's going to be president. Whatever. And it's just a huge mistake. It's not biblically sound. Now it doesn't mean there aren't, we shouldn't support certain candidates and that there aren't viewpoints that do matter to the church and that we should, I mean, we're just not talking about that on this podcast. It causes people to deconstruct when they can easily dismantle your religion as a politic and politics are easily dismantled in my opinion. So, and I think it's also just an indictment for Christians of if, if you're primarily known as passionate about politics and your primary, like all of your energy and all of your extra time is going towards politics. And when people think of you, that's what they think of is this or that. Um, instead of a believer, like we've talked about as your primary identity, that's, that's something we need to repent from. And, and also it doesn't, um, further the kingdom when people look at your life and see primarily Republican or primarily Democrat and then Christian when it comes to all that you're pouring your energy. And like, if the only passionate conversations you have with your friends and relatives are about politics and not about what the Lord's doing in your life, like that seems like something we need to confess. Okay, Brandon, you're starting to meddle now. That's enough. Okay. No, but let's move on. Am I getting preachy? I'm sorry. But, but at the same time though, I think it can not, not only be confusing, it can also rob God of glory. Absolutely. So it's like, so, okay. So in order to have a certain political standing or whatever, I'm going to adopt children or foster children or do other things. And it's like, well, I'm, I'm so glad that those things are happening. But at the same time, it's like, okay, if you're doing this X for personal gain or for political recognition, man, what a, what a bummer. Yeah. You know, absolutely. And I think you can pick it. You can pick what, what you fill in that blank with. Absolutely. But yeah, that's all that I had to say. Political points is your, is your main motive. Yeah. In game. That's a good way to say it. If that's your end game is I'm going to get points on the political side of things, then, then you may be a humanist, whether you acknowledge it or not. That's good. And so it's, it's for us as Christians, I talked about, you know, in the last election, I wondered how many people who claim to be Christians voted according to some different aspect of their identity, primarily. Like I'm a Christian, but I voted as a woman, or I'm a Christian, but I voted as a Southerner. I'm a Christian, but I voted as a man or as a Caucasian or as a, and, and all of those don't fit within Christianity. And therefore, of course, are offensive to someone who's trying to build their faith. And they see, they begin to suspect that our faith, that we have an idol. And it's, it's, you know, when, when God says you have no other gods before me and no idols equal to me, you know, no gods equal to me, no gods before me. That's, that's intentional. And, and I just think we're always, it's always scary to say, you know, when we link words to Christian, I'm a Christian blank. Now we're using Christian as a modifier. And I would always rather reverse that around. Like I would, yeah, I would be more comfortable saying I'm a conservative Christian or liberal Christian than to say I'm a Christian conservative or a Christian liberal. Like the descriptive term, we need, because the descriptive term can change because it's not the fundamental part of our identity. I think it's Christian. Like we've talked about, it's not that those other identities aren't important. Like I am a woman. Right. Exactly. That is something that the Lord, the, an identity God has given me is that I'm a woman, but it's not like you're saying it's not our primary identity. Yep. Yeah. Can I also ask, and I know that this is kind of, you might label this as a little late in the game. Let's, if we define the word politics. Yeah. So I actually had written that down. Okay. Because there, there, there can be kind of the ideal or the ideology of here, my political ideologies, right? But then there's also just the idea of politics within a workplace or politics within social settings and stuff like that. Right. That is a little bit different. Yeah. Absolutely. And so it's just a, so, if I remember correctly, I Paulus is a community. Okay. And so this, politics are the rules of a community, how a community crafts, it's standards, it's rules, it's guidelines, it's leadership. How do people achieve decision-making power? That may be the best way of understanding it. And so politics is the process in any given culture or community of how people achieve decision-making power. So you have church politics. How do you become a decision-maker in the church? What are the standards? What are the virtues? What are the, what do we look for in that? And that's going to be true of any given community within the family. How do you achieve decision-making power within, again, a tribe within a government? And so within any given, that's all the politics is. Yeah. And as society, here's what's funny. So you'll have to excuse this. This is too good to not mention it, but, you know, frontiers, frontiersmen, the first cutting edge frontiersmen actually are essentially always men. Not quite probably always, but frontiersmen, the people who were carving a path across America or across Africa or across Australia are usually men. And I had a political science professor say, society begins the first time that man looks around before he urinates. So that's how, you know, society has begun. Until then, it's just him. And the rules are entirely up to him. But the first time that he looks around, he's like, oh, I better see who's watching before I do this. You now have a society. And at that point, you need some rules. And so what are the rules? And one of the rules is who gets to make the rules and politics is who gets to make the rules. Okay. And so when you have a society of politics and politics is who makes the rules. Culture are the non-political rules about a society is culture. The decision-making rules are about politics. And in America, those are now inextricably linked. You can't pull them apart. All of our politicians are celebrities and vice versa. So to say the word cultural politics or something like that, it's just like, wait, what? Exactly. It's kind of the same thing. There's a big debate among people as to whether culture runs down, is downhill of politics or politics is downhill from culture. Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Which one influences the other? There was a great quote years ago by the Quizcrest with media. Frank Peretti asked the question back when TV was the only version of this. He said, does TV affect the culture or does TV reflect the culture? So we could take out media TV today and put in media. Does media affect the culture or does it reflect the culture? And Frank Peretti's answer 25 years ago was TV is the culture. And like now we would say media is the culture. We have no culture in America outside of media. Like it's a, there's nothing else. We don't do any other cultural things that aren't video, some version of video or audio. And so very rarely do we actually go see the thing. We see the thing through to something else. Yeah. Even if we're there. Even if we're there. That's what I don't know if you said, when I was teaching to a private school the other day and showing them pictures of people watching a, watching a concert through their phone, right? Like they're literally at the car, they bought tickets. Now they're looking at watch. So talking about watching fireworks here, our big fireworks show. That's right. And me telling Facetiming my wife and like, she couldn't be there. So I want you to see the finale. And I realized the next thing I'm watching the finale of this fireworks through my phone. Like, wait, there's fireworks right over there. But I'm watching them through this tiny little screen. Like, why am I watching these? These are terrible. Oh wait, they're right there. They're literally blowing in the sky a hundred feet from me. So that means media's culture is politics. That's exactly right. Oh, and there's, man, we're learning truth about that. Aren't we? Yeah. And right now with social media stuff, but that's what politics is. And so who gets to make the rules? And obviously that is greatly influenced by ethical decisions like the Judeo-Christian ethic, et cetera. And all those. And so that's a, those are, those are big issues. I don't think you're late to the game. I think, yeah. Well, and I think it kind of falls into, okay, well, if you don't have something to put your hope in or you're, you're looking for that, I feel like I would probably lean toward, okay, well, who's making those decisions? That's what I'm going to be invested in. Yes. Because that's what affects me and the people that I love. Doesn't that make sense? Yeah. Which is a good kind of next step for what we've been talking about of what do we need to deconstruct when it comes to politics, but then answering the second part of that of how do we reconstruct? You know, because we've talked this whole podcast about you, we don't end with deconstruction. We then put towards reconstruction. So then the next question is how do we reconstruct with all of these things that we've learned? And I think one of them is when it comes to politics of what am I building my hope in? And when it comes to a lot of this is deconstructing the difference between Christianity and politics, but also just the hope that we've placed in politics that it can't provide for us. And so in my mind, reconstructing starts with like you're saying, Colson, what am I putting my hope in? And it doesn't mean we don't be in, you know, or should stay away from politics or not be involved or not care or be informed. It just means we're replacing our hope is the first question that we need to ask. Yeah. And it may mean, it's amazing how often reconstruction starts with repentance. Yeah. The reconstruction starts with, okay, I've been trusting in the wrong things. I've been looking to the wrong things. I need to change that and start looking someplace else. And for all of us, we're going to need that regularly. So first is that. Even recognizing that in others, of like if the way that others have handled this have caused me to deconstruct, even if they are following the Lord or saying they're following the Lord or whatever it is, recognizing where they may have misplaced their hope when it comes to politics, and then even admitting how that's affected us. Yep. Yep. And acknowledging where we may have also lumped things together, where we rejected Christ because of a politician who claimed Him. Or we rejected Christ because of a parent, even, who claimed Him or a pastor who claimed Him or a church who claimed Him and then actually used Him for political means. We get burned by that and our temptation is to want to reject Christ. And instead, what we probably need to do is reject that philosophy, that place, that person's role there, that person's mindset that got us there. Interesting. And remember, like we just talked about that we are ambassadors. We're not of a political party or a kingdom here on earth. We're ambassadors of another kingdom. And I think when it comes to politics, we have to keep that in mind or we stray really quickly. Do you think that, I mean, people who are not associated with Christianity are frustrated with Christians for a similar reason why people might be frustrated with, or historically with Jewish people, of like, well, they're set apart, or they see themselves as set apart. And so, do you think it puts people off? Sure. And that's, I mean, so part of the memory, we have to remember that there is a thing that is called persecution. And there are things that should be. I mean, there are things that should get us persecuted or disagreed with or whatever. And some of those things will be political. I mean, we will be on the wrong, so some of our biblical views will be immoral by today's standards. We should have seized on that. And so that's going to be the case, that there are going to be some. And when those matters become political, and then we're going to be on the quote wrong side of that from our culture, and that's going to be it. And so, I mean, I would love for us to only find ourselves on the wrong side of the ones that actually are biblical, that'd be great, versus just the ones that we prefer, or we like better, or that we are grossed out by or not or something. But I think that's part of it. But I also do think based on this biblical picture, even the biblical picture, I think Jesus was as involved in his political situation as he could be, which was in his case, probably to speak out and eventually be killed for it. And so he was teaching religious truth, but teaching religious truth got him killed by governing authorities. Because he was not trying to overthrow Rome, he was not preaching against Rome, and yet Rome is who executed him for political reasons. And so, because he represented a threat to them in some way, then they decided the easiest way was just crucify him via the religious leaders of the time. So again, hurt his own people. Yeah, right. Yeah. And so I think that's a reminder, I think it's totally appropriate for Christians to run for office for us to vote, for us to protest. I think those are all totally, potentially, totally appropriate things for Christians to do. But they aren't inherently Christian behaviors, you may not get to do any of those things. And right now, if you're a member of the church in China, you probably don't get to do any of those things. You might not. And so if you're a part of the church in Iran, you probably can't do many of those things. Christians don't always get to do those things. When we do, I think it's totally appropriate for us to do those, to be involved politically and to a level that's appropriate, that doesn't cost us our faith or our testimony. But there you go. Okay. There you go. That's tough. Listen, as always, these are sophisticated, tough conversations. Thanks for diving deep with us. Oh, yes. Definitely. And I would actually love if you have a question related to politics, or policy, or something that you've been wrestling with that you'd like to hear us talk about, I can't guarantee that we would, we're going to handle it, but we'll certainly try.
