We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Okay, welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Bryn Starnes, and I'm really excited about today's episode. We are in a series talking about purity culture. And if you missed our last episode, I encourage you to go ahead and listen to that one first. We kind of talked about the definition of purity culture, what it is as a movement, and just kind of how it got started, its foundation, all of that. And then today, I'm really excited. I have two of my long time dear friends on to talk about this and their experiences with it. So I'm going to go ahead and introduce them. And then we'll go ahead and dive in to kind of our experiences with purity culture as a movement. And we don't mean like, just the teaching of purity, we mean like as a movement from the 90s and 2000s. And so yeah, but I'm really excited about this, my two friends that are on today. The first one is Ruth Terry Vilches. And she is a longtime friend since call it well since I was in college, she's a little bit younger than me. And we have been just like deep friends for a long time. And she's been a friend that has always pushed me to see both sides of things and understand the other really well. So whatever we're talking about, she always pushes me to understand before to be understood, which I really appreciate. And she seeks to understand others has a lot of experience with other cultures and subcultures. Yeah, and I just value her ability to think deeply and to have complex conversations and understand others well. And then and I'm gonna let them do a little intro about themselves more personally. But then the other one is Catherine Covington, who's been on before. And if you missed her previous interview, we unpacked kind of her story. And it was awesome. So I encourage you to go back and listen to that. But Catherine has also been a longtime friend. It's just an intellectual, a deep thinker, but also super fun. And I just value the balance of those things. Well, like those the balance of those two things is just like so refreshing, I think. And just as a really loyal friend, and we are, she'll tell you, but we're kind of at different points now and kind of some of our beliefs, but just her ability to still have conversations and understand nuance also and just yeah, have healthy, really, really healthy conversations I value deeply. So I'll let both of you kind of give an intro, brief intro about yourself, whatever you feel like is, yeah, you want to share is relevant. And then we'll jump in Ruth, if you if you want to go first, you go ahead. Sure. I like how you said that I that I always bring the other perspective. That was like a really kind way to say that I argue with you. Yeah, my Hello, this is I would try not to laugh as I was hearing you do your introduction, Bryn, just because it's, it's just really fun to hear you on the podcast. But my name is Ruth. And I am currently living in Basin Austin, Texas. My undergrad is in community development and international studies. And I have my Masters of theological studies from Covenant Seminary. I am currently a mother to two little kiddos, an aunt to many, and a wife and friend and neighbor, and trying to get better at all those things. I previously worked in the nonprofit world and then still do some type of consulting slash independent projects here and there. Yeah, I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, was homeschooled youngest of five kids homeschooled K through 12. purity culture is definitely all around me. I'm thankful my parents were not pushing it as hardcore as like some of the other folks around. Then I should say the negative aspects of it as hardcore. But it was definitely in the environment that I was around and growing up in Birmingham. I have a lot of thoughts, a lot of unprocessed thoughts as well. But I'm excited to dive into it today with both and all of you guys. Awesome. Well, I'm Catherine, like Bryn said, I always love listening to Bryn and her producers, us, because it always just is very complimentary. I'm like, Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, like Bryn said, I did, I grew up in a cult, which is a fun little tidbit we talked about a lot in the podcast I was on previously. I was also homeschooled K through 12. And we, purity culture was very, very heavily preached to me, the toxic aspects of it as well as the biblical ones. And just for a little bit of perspective of where we stand now, I don't identify as a Christian. I'm definitely a little bit more on the agnostic side of things. So I am coming from a different perspective than Bryn and Ruth and Colson. And I am by far the least qualified person to be talking. I do not have any degrees in anything theological. I have a degree in mechanical engineering. I used to work in government contracting, worked with the DOD doing facilities engineering. And now I work in firearms manufacturing. So where can all those females stereotype? Let's go. No one ever said I didn't fight about things. Again, I'm in firearms manufacturing. So not even a little bit of theology or social work or anything, but I always have an opinion. So let's we can chat. That's awesome. I just want to add, oh, sorry, that this is the first time I've seen Catherine in like maybe 15, 16 years. Bringing people back together. I had to add your name in my phone. And I was like, Ruth Terry. I was like, I know it's not her name anymore. But it's Ruth Terry. It technically is still, it's still my last name. So you're good. Great. Great. Yeah. And then Colson's also here because I want him to feel like he can ask questions. I'm just here to listen. And then also when something goes wrong, you can just blame it on me. It's like Colson dead gum. No, all the girls are here to talk about purity and Colson's gonna go have a pizza party. Yeah. Honestly, this is actually great. I have my daughter is six years old. And so also just a really great thing to learn. I feel like I'm I feel like I'm a terrible parent. I just I don't I learn. I'm like, my wife and I are often just looking at each other like, how do we deal with this? I feel like that's great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just like, I don't have this down. And so it's also great to like, yeah, my upbringing was a little as I was a missionary kid. Yeah. And so I was around purity culture. But as a guy, I think it was just a little different. Yeah. And by a little, I mean, it was probably world's different. Yeah. And so and we and we didn't really talk about the other side of things very much. Yeah. And so I'm really, yeah, I'm really grateful to listen. And to lurk behind. Well, no, that's a great point. I'm glad you brought up your daughter. Because I think if you're listening to this podcast, our hope is like there, we have a lot of different hopes that we want to accomplish through this. But I think one is yeah, to hear stories about how purity culture has impacted us kind of unpack that we I've like, posted on social media about it and have had a lot of people reach out and share their stories. We all have friends who we've talked to and have shared their stories. And I think one is just to raise more awareness. But two, I think, yeah, all of us are adults. And it's like, hey, we want to unpack how this has affected us. But also, we may be having, you know, children or have friends who have kids or cousins, you know, I mean, nieces and nephews. And as we're raising the next generation, we want to not repeat the things that have been done poorly. And that's one of our hopes for this. But also, I feel like there's a lot of conversation around purity culture and how it's gone wrong. But from what I have found in my search, some of it is nuanced, but a lot of it is not a lot of it is reactionary or out of anger, which is understandable, as we'll get into. But I think having just a really good conversation that is beneficial is sometimes rare. So that's kind of our hope. But as we start, I would love to just kind of hear what both of your experiences in purity culture are. And then we can kind of unpack. Yeah, how you feel like they affected people, but your experiences are people close to you. So we can kind of bounce around. But if both of you all want to go into that first. Yeah, I'd love to hear your experiences. You want to start? Okay, I'll start. Yeah. The first. Like distinct memory I have of like talking about purity is my mom had me read Elizabeth Elliott's Passion and Purity. And as a text, I really this is coming from me not having read it in probably 17, 18 years, right? But I don't remember it being problematic or overbearing. I remember it being very biblical and just kind of factual and hey, what does the Bible say about this? And but again, this is my memory. No, I haven't reread it anytime in recent history. So endorsement. Yeah, exactly. And don't be like, well, Catherine said this, okay, I'm sorry. I read it when I was like 12. But reading that I remember being, okay, like I'm on board, I can follow this, I understand this. And then the actual experience of talking about purity in the church and by leaders was so aggressively different from being like, Oh, this is what the Bible says about it. And this is what this person's interpretation of what the Bible says about it, to then shifting to all of these crazy metaphors of basically, you are ruined if you touch somebody, you know what I mean? Or are touched by somebody, just the crazy the tape metaphor, you know, the more you stick it, the less sticky it gets. And then it's not useful as tape anymore. And you're like, wait a second, like, am I the tape? And I'm not useful as a human or as a woman, if I get stuck to too many things, hang on, you know, or the poop in the brownies. I don't know if y'all remember that one. That one's insane. What? Yeah, it was this whole. I don't know this one. There's a whole metaphor of like, if you cook a pan of brownies, obviously, you will eat the brownies and they're delicious. But like, if you put like, a teaspoon of like poop in the brownie batter, do you want to eat the brownies anymore? It doesn't matter how little amount of poop is in the brownies. You can't like, it ruins everything regardless of how who is out here coming up with these. I have no idea. Like, it's horrific. And of course, like the rose one is what the rose is most common. That one's really common. The more petals you lose, the less pretty your roses and just all these crazy metaphors that just was like every time someone handles the rose, it gets damaged. Yeah. And like the more people that handle it, there's like nothing left. Right. Yeah. And then you end up with a thorny stem and no flower. And it's just gosh, so aggressively dehumanizing to women, in my opinion. And that was kind of just the perspective that we were taught, you know. And I feel like with a lot of things in Christian culture is if it's true in small measure, then it is also true. It's more true in a larger measure. Right. So yes, we don't want to have sex before marriage. But now that that's true, you also shouldn't kiss anybody that you're not going to get married to or even until your marriage. And then even more true than that, you shouldn't have any physical contact. Like we don't even want you holding hands before marriage. And then even more true to that, you shouldn't even date anybody. You know, you should only be speaking to somebody of the opposite sex if it's with the intention of marriage. You know, it's just like, yeah, this this tiny thing that could be psychologically very healthy, like, hey, let's not sleep around a lot, right? Let's try and preserve ourselves for our spouse. And I can get on board with that. I'm like, okay, yeah, I respect that perspective. But then just this thought of, Oh, well, if it's true in this tiny measure, then even more so more and more and more. And it's like, okay, but is that actually the list just goes on infinitely, right? And it just gets more and more exaggerated. As as time goes on, and it's like, is this even even close to biblically accurate anymore? Like, I can't wait, we can't hold hands anymore. Oh, wait, you know, I can't date somebody. It's just, you know, I felt was really, really aggressive. Yeah. And some of the like, takeaways that I see now looking back, one, I feel like purity culture was really heavily taught by people that didn't abide by it. As adolescents, right? It was people that became Christians in adulthood and said, Oh, man, I wish I would have XYZ. So I'm going to teach my kids to do this. And so these standards and things that they were trying to enforce and let you know was the gold standard of living, they never actually had to abide by. So it's like, how realistic is this? And then two, the other thing that was really difficult for me to balance with purity culture, was growing up in the cold, it was very patriarchal as well. And everything was so concentrated on, you know, you need to defer to the teaching and the leadership of the man in your life, right? Be it your father or your future partner or whatever, like they need to be leading you spiritually. And so a lot of the women that I spoke to their experiences in mind as well, is, you know, I was dating somebody that I thought I was going to marry. And, you know, then that person pressured you into sex. And it's like, okay, well, I know I'm not supposed to be doing I'm not supposed to be having sex with this person. I know that that's not what God wants me to do. But also, I'm supposed to be following the spiritual lead of this person that's going to be like my husband. So what is like, where does the breakdown switch? Like, okay, which one do I need to prioritize more than the other? And yeah, and I think that that ended up being a very difficult situation to navigate that I know, dozens of women that are in, you know what I mean? Like, okay, I'm supposed to follow their lead, but also, I'm a horrible person if I do so. Yeah, you know, I'm not worthless as a woman if I do so. Just, yeah, very, very toxic. Like not even a nuanced conversation about authority or like, what do you do when the authority that you're under is not following or not treating you well, you know, like all those conversations. Yeah, correct. Man. Yeah. And it seems like we talked about this during your interview, but a lot of it going back to parents who meant well, it's like, Hey, I wish I'd done some things differently. There's not really a like rubric or you know, there's not really a formula for this. And so it inadvertently seems like it came from like a good intention, but then became parenting out of fear. Oh, I want to avoid all the XYZ. I want my children to avoid this. Therefore, I'm going to resort to fear, which means like lots and lots of rules. Yeah, lots of rules and lots of control. That's where I was going with that. Yeah. And it's just like you and Colson were talking about, like, we don't know what we're doing. We're parents for the first time and everybody is parents for the first time. So you're just out here doing your best. And sometimes that's not always ideal. Yeah, yeah. That's thanks for sharing. That's that's really insightful. Ruth, you want to share some of your experience? Yeah. It's interesting, because I've like thought, you know, a lot about purity culture off and on. And I know, Brandon, I've had conversations about it. But just to have the concentrated time to actually really dive into I'm thankful for because I mean, it just seeped into a lot, a lot of things. And I guess in the previous episode, y'all actually defined like what pretty culture is because I feel like we're throwing this term around. But yeah, I mean, you can you can define again, if you want, though, if you want to. Yeah, I like what you mean by it. Yeah, I think when I think about purity culture, I think about a people sort of narrowing what purity meant into this sort of into a narrow definition, as it related to sexuality. So purity became conflated with virginity, essentially. And and even though I think some of the verses that were used, right, like, you know, having an undivided heart towards the Lord, it was like those were applied towards like sexuality and proverbs was used a lot, right to justify things and and like just kind of versus picked and chosen, you know, the adulterous woman, which you did not want to be right. And then like the wise woman and I think that for me personally, that wasn't like a complete definition. But what I think of it as is like the yeah, a conflation of purity with virginity. So rather than purity being like a focused heart on God, it would just became about kind of sex. So ironically, it was like this hyper sexualization. But at the same time, trying to emphasize an under sexualization, right? Like, we are like hyper sexualizing what purity means. But then we actually don't want you to be a sexual being at all. Exactly. Which is like, I mean, it's like, it's simple, it's simple, guys. You know, we're like these like hormonal teenagers and are like, what's going on? For me personally, I think what that looks like, I definitely identified and totally bought into the slippery slope, right? Because I tend to be a more analytical person. So I'm like, okay, well, if, you know, if sex and sexuality is just for marriage, then there's no reason that we should be dating, definitely not dating, definitely not even having sex, but definitely not dating. And then if we're not going to be dating, then why should we even try to be attracted to other people? So if there is attraction, like I should squelch that because that's not gonna lead to anything good. Definitely not, you know, kissing because that's something physical. Holding hands is, I don't know, like, and so it's a toehold. Yeah, watch out. Right. And I think, you know, it's interesting, because I had to take like a logic, of course, on and that's just a classic slippery slope logical fallacy. But, but for my like analytical teenage brain, which developmentally, we know that brains, like, don't actually get the capacity to think nuance as nuance until you're older anyways, you know, I mean, I'm not saying that about all teenagers, but that's just, you know, brain science. Some of the synthesis and other things that happen later in life. So, you know, I think for me, that really looked like and I look back, it was so unhealthy, I was so unaware of my own sexuality, and my own just, I think attraction in general to when I got to the point in college, where I liked my husband, I spent eight months trying to figure out if I actually like was attracted to him. It's like, no. Sorry, you can't. I'm my bad. I'm not gonna I'm gonna not say that. But you can't be like, no, like, yes, I am. Of course, I'm attracted to this man. But I just literally had so suppressed that part of him. Because of the super stuff, I didn't want to, you know, and so I look back now and I'm like, oh, yeah, I think I probably was attracted to that guy. But I didn't even want to allow myself to like, feel an attraction, because that just seemed like, well, why should I even be attracted to somebody? If I'm not at a point where I could date them or marry them, you know, it was like, it's like all lumped together, like Catherine was saying of like, which is dragging more and more into like, wrong. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I know not to interrupt you, Ruth, but I know so many couples that had a really difficult time, especially the women having sex after they were married, like they waited till marriage to have sex. Yeah. And then they've associated so much guilt and shame and evil with the concept of sex that they were just like, this feels so wrong. And I shouldn't want to do this. And I shouldn't do this, because I'm a good girl. And I haven't done this. And I like, it's just so wrong, even though that's what it's intended for. You know what I mean? Like, that they had such a difficult time removing that shame and guilt and evil from their psyche, because it had just been entirely ingrained with sex. Yeah. Yeah. And I think like going back to kind of what I mentioned, this conflation of purity with sexuality. So then like, well, what does it look like if you're married, to not just like, be able to like, have sex and really view it as something that's beautiful and enjoyable, but actually, like, see that as part of your purity, like in a way, right? Like you're, you know, I think sometimes we make two mistakes. We either call something that's bad good, or we call something that's good, bad. And, and so when you have grown up in a culture that, you know, was looking, and again, I don't think that the people that were necessarily teaching it meant to do this, although I do wonder, I would love to like go back and talk with them about their sex lives and their marriage and be like, what was going on? But maybe that would be TMI. Um, well, I mean, especially with like, IBLP, Bill Gothard wasn't married. Yeah. And he's out here telling us how to build our marriages and raise our children and think, well, you're not married and you don't have kids. And I'm not saying you can't have an opinion on it. I'm married and I don't have children. I'm out here, you know, giving my opinion about it. But it's like these leaders that are just making blanket authoritarian rules for everyone, you know, based on their interpretation of the based on their interpretation. And that's law now. Yeah. Yeah. So I think like when I like what you were, yeah, like you're saying good, like good, calling good and bad. Yeah. And so, so as a kid, right, like I essentially started calling attraction bad. I didn't say that verbally. I didn't. But that was the logical conclusion. I think I reached is like, why would I try to like, think about or dwell on or like, acknowledge, like any sort of attraction? Because if I'm not going to do anything with it right now, then it doesn't matter. Rather than like acknowledging like, this is like part of what God called good when he made the world. And so essentially kind of doing that. And then having to undo that, you know, when I did actually finally acknowledge that I was really attracted to someone and really liked them and then had to work through that. So I think that's the first thing is kind of like, I totally saw it's the first of my own life. And I think I caused a lot of hurt to a lot of people to myself, but also to other people, when I just was an unintentionally aware of my own self and other people's, you know, feelings in that regard. And then of course, you know, promulgating and I don't even I think that's that word, but like propagating that to other people like, like, why would you, why would you date right now? Why would you do this instead of seeing it as something that was a process rather than just like, you know, final thing. But the second thing, I don't know if that makes sense. But the second thing that I wrote down was, I think, periodical culture also really, so the specific aspects I'm thinking about are like purity ceremonies, where you like, and I totally participated in one of these, where you like bought a purity ring. And maybe one of your parents gave it to you, but you're like making a promise to them and to God and it was a ceremony and their parts of it that were beautiful. It was kind of like a dedication, you know, ceremony to the Lord. But it was like a rite of passage. Yeah, a rite of passage. Yeah. But then also, you know, I can remember like buying a journal and being excited to like write letters to my future husband. And the thing that I feel like because it's so emphasized like this aspect of you is only for one person, it kind of also was almost like this Disney tale of like there's only one person out there for you and you're saving yourself for them. And so I think it also created this kind of like, yeah, like, there's one person out there for you and you're saving yourself for them, and you should only be thinking about them. And you're doing all these things for them. And I think that led to a lot of like disappointment for a lot of people. And also, this idolization of marriage as the ultimate goal rather than like, really healthy friendships, or really healthy community, or, you know, things like that. Yeah. Yeah. So that was kind of the other thing is sort of this like idolization of like the one or just marriage and family. Yeah. And God forbid you get it wrong. Because you shouldn't be dating and you should only be courting if your intention is marriage. But then they don't talk about like, hey, well, what if I started courting this person and I don't want to marry them? You know what I mean? It's like, nope, you picked. You picked the one too bad. Yeah. And of course it wasn't actually verbalized, but that was the. But when it's all together, it's like, Oh, basically, if you have already started giving quote unquote, giving your heart to this person, even though you're not in a covenant of any kind. Yeah. Like, yeah, it's like somehow you still had that. Like if your courtship failed, yeah, you know, it still felt like you were tainted somehow. Absolutely. Like you're saying, yeah, yeah. And it feels like the only thing that as a church or as a community that we just agreed, like, if you do this, you failed, right? No other commandment that God gives of like, hey, don't lie. Don't steal. Don't lust. Don't like all of those things were like, Hey, we're going to fail. It's like, oh, well, if you, if you've done this, you're ruined. And, you know, not that they specifically say that, but it's pretty heavily implied, you know? And, and so, you know, it's like, Hey, don't lie. Don't steal. Don't lust. Don't like all of those things were like, hey, we're going to fail at this. And, and we just gotta keep trying to be our best person. As we had times where when we were doing viewed the same way, it was, it was, well, if you've lost it, you never get enough back. Right. You know, and now you're ruined for whoever you're supposed to marry. And feel bad for that guy. Okay. So I do want to unpack kind of like what, how you feel like it. Yeah, go ahead, Ruth. Sorry. Could I add one more thing? Um, yeah, totally. This is just as Catherine was talking, I think going back to again, like this idea that like there's the one person that you're saving yourself for. And, um, it was like kind of Disney meets like IBLP. But, um, I think one of the, the things I remember having like a really sad conversation with one of my friends, um, is, which I think this is appropriate to say. I've just realized like who listens to this podcast? Cause I'm like going into other deeper things, but usually not children, if that's what you're worried about. Yeah. Okay. So I was having my children with my friends. If you are listening to this with your children, just put your AirPods in really fast. Yeah. Go ahead. Um, so like so much of, of sexuality again was like, uh, equated with, you know, purity, um, it equals, you know, virginity or equals sexual purity kind of. Um, and I remember having a conversation, a really sad conversation with my friends in college who, um, also like grew up in this culture. Um, and was, uh, anyways, was having sex. Um, at that point with his girlfriend and I remember they, I think anyways, I had a conversation and I was like, why don't, why don't you buy condoms? Like you need to be buying condoms. And his comment to me was, well, I feel like if I'm doing that, then I'm acknowledging that I'm going to be having sex. And it was this like, it was this like inner turmoil that he felt right. And my point is not like, do you buy condoms? I do not buy condoms. But my point was that there wasn't, um, like it was, there was just this, um, in a, in a way he had grown up in this culture and didn't have a way to be able to have conversations about like what healthy sex looked like. And that's like one example, but what's interesting, and maybe this is like cycling into something else, but we know of so many cases of abuse that have happened in some of these cultures. And I think in some ways there was so much conversation of don't, don't do this, don't have sex, that there weren't positive conversations about what does healthy sex look like? What does a healthy sexuality look like? Um, you know, what does it mean that like when you're married, it doesn't just mean that anything goes, you know, it means that you'd be having conversations with. And, but so much of purity culture was just pushing back against, you know, sex and sexuality in general, I think that it didn't allow for the nuanced conversation of, of them diving into like, what, what does a healthy sexuality look like? At least for me, it was like, no sexuality equals healthy sexuality, you know? And I, so, I so get exactly what you mean. Like when I started having sex, it was the same thing. I was like, Oh, I need to get on birth control, but it felt so wrong. Cause it was like, okay, now it's like premeditated instead of crime of passion. I mean, it's like, Oh, if I, if it just happened, then somehow it's better than if I've prepared for it. Yeah, totally. Which I think, I think y'all are hitting on so many good things, but I think you're right that there are so many things that in all of this teaching, a, it took something that God himself created. Um, you know, like we joke about this around the church, the church, a lot of like, it's not like humans, humans invented sex and God's like, what are you, what are you doing over there? You know, it's like, anyway, so we, but we took this thing that God created and God called good and we, in an effort to, you know, shame or scare people into following his ethic, we turned it into something bad. Um, and, and so all of sexuality became bad, like you're saying, but then also, yeah, it, it kind of minimized. And I've seen a lot of people say this, um, that it, it even minimized sexuality. Intercoi, inter, well, intercourse alone. And so it, like you're saying it, it limited all of these conversations about like, what is purity actually? Like, what does it mean to protect your body? Like, what does it mean to, you know, to treat someone with dignity? What does it mean to, you know, like all of these conversations and then Ruth, like you're saying the extreme of that being, um, yeah, the only goal that was taught was, you know, don't have intercourse before marriage and then no other conversations. And so there have been so many situations that I've read about where, um, because that's the only thing that was talked about. There's a lot of abuse and miss, um, misapplied scriptures once people are in marriage and A, they have all this trauma because they haven't been taught, um, the beauty and the dignity and like all of these things that God intended from the front end. And then they get married and they're told, okay, go have sex now. And that's all that they're told. And so you're trying to have a healthy sexuality and sexual relationship with your husband. But then also it, I've heard of a lot of people who, you know, men also haven't been taught a healthy sexuality and a biblical sexuality. And so then marriages, um, are broken. And even in extreme cases, abuse is enabled because women are taught that sexuality is for your husband. And you know, all these, I mean, we could just list out all of the unhealthy wrong, um, teachings under that heading. But yeah, just like such a sad progression of this where if I don't know if I'm describing that well, I'm kind of all over the place, but like a sad progression of like, we started calling what God calls good, um, evil and an attempt to actually avoid what God calls sin. And then the impact just carried over into, um, yeah, into marriages and, um, left a lot of people just really broken with no way of putting those pieces back together and no realistic way of having a healthy relationship once they were married. Um, and even a healthy relationship with themselves, like understanding their own physicality, their own body and sexuality. Um, but yeah, so, and then even, oh, I mean, this, like, a whole different thing that we could talk about for awhile, but even the conversations around women being responsible for men sin and the amount of like, I was, um, I've heard so many women say that the, when they were raped, the first thing they were asked by Christians in their life was what were you wearing? That whole conversation of like, instead of responding out of compassion for a traumatic event that had happened to their sister, their, their daughter, whatever, it was immediately assuming that it was their fault. Um, as if that would ever be your fault. And so just like became twisted over time of like this thing grew and grew and grew. And depending on the situation that you were in kind of morphed into really ugly things. But, um, but yeah, I don't know. Do y'all have any thoughts on any of that? I kind of just, well, back onto what you were saying about the clothing. I feel like in the culture I was in at least that anytime like a girl was dressing in like a rebellious manner, which let's be honest, an IVLP rebellious manner meant that like their denim skirt had a slip that went above the knee or something, you know, showing their ankles, like truly like their white polo was a little too tight, you know, but it almost was like, Wait, you were allowed to wear white though? I didn't think you'd be allowed to wear white. That's too secret. Oh no, that was, that was the uniform actually for white, um, white shirts and denim or navy skirts was the uniform for conferences. If you were wearing like a tank under your white shirt, it can't be having see-through. Yeah. Um, but like a woman wearing dressing in a way that was deemed rebellious or edgy or something like that, provocative, almost gave people permission to treat them sexually. Like, you know, you would, you would see a girl walking by dressed like that. And they'd be like, Oh, you know, she's blah, blah, blah. You know what I mean? And it's like, well, I'm sorry. Why are we now allowed to sexualize this person? Or why is it like seen as almost more virtuous that we're acknowledging that they're a sexual person just because of the clothes that they've put on? Yeah. You know, and I feel like that is really similar to the concept of, you know, well, what were you wearing? Yeah. Yeah. And it goes back to what Ruth was saying about de-sexualizing people, meaning like, like basically, God is expecting you to be sexually sexual. God is expecting you to be sexless until you get married. Like that's kind of the conversation of like, there's no conversation about like, what is beauty? Like, what does it mean to, you know, honor the way that, you know, like honor beauty and other people without objectifying them, like all of those conversations. So it's like you had to be a sexless, attractiveness lump or people were justified in their sin. Correct. And it was your fault. Correct. Right. Yeah. So the modesty piece, I mean, I, you can't have a conversation about some of this culture without talking about like how, how central the modesty conversation was. I mean, I had so many conversations around modesty and I, and I bought into most of them. I was, you know, allowed to wear pants and shorts and, you know, tankinis. Oh my God. Thank goodness, since you were a soccer player. So why weren't you playing soccer in a full length? And I'm scared. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. I mean, I think you can't really, and to be fair, it wasn't just towards women. I remember having conversations where like guys should be wearing shirts at the pool because if they were shirtless, then that was also in modest and at its best. I think that's rare though. Side note, I haven't heard a lot of people that included men in that conversation. So interesting. Okay. Yeah. But so, so I think, you know, at its best, there was this desire and I think I could still onboard like, is what you're wearing. Are you wearing it solely for the purpose of drawing attention to yourself, whatever that looks like? Or is what you're wearing like, are you wearing it to glorify God? That is a very broad category, by the way, because I don't think it's wrong to call attention to your own beauty. I don't think that there's anything inherently wrong with that. But I think that was sometimes what was taught is like, if you are in any way drawing attention, whether it's wearing too much makeup or wearing too much jewelry or wearing too much, you know, clothing that's drawing attention to yourself as a beautiful person, then it must be from a standpoint of pride and something else. And I think, again, like going back to sort of what I see as undergirding a lot of this is this like separation between the physical and the spiritual, where the physical was deemed as less holy and less good. And the spiritual is what you should be trying to cultivate. So, you know, you shouldn't be focusing on your outward appearance because God looks at the heart. And, you know, we shouldn't and these are verses that are like in the Bible, but then we twisted them to kind of do what we wanted. And so we decided, oh, well, the outward appearance doesn't matter at all. And yet Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us. And like, you know, the physical really mattered in the incarnation because otherwise God could have just come, you know, as any form, but he took human form. And so the physical really matters, but in this, a lot of these conversations, physical equals sexual equals bad. And so it was sort of like this, I would say, you know, Gnostic heresy in some ways, maybe didn't start out as that way. But, you know, Gnosis isn't being sort of like this elevation of the spiritual and devaluation of the physical and material. And so when it came to modesty, you should cultivate your heart. Like you should focus on your heart. Like what is your heart? But you just focus on the beauty of your heart, you know, and then I'm like, then you're having conversations with people who are going like, well, like, I'm, I'm not really attracted to this person physically, but either like a really good, you know, they seem to have all the other and I'm like, no, it matters that you're attracted to them. Like that actually matters. Like if you're going to marry them. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You know, but that was seen as like, oh, you know, but it's like that was kind of seen like shallow because of some of the conversations I think around physical appearance and modesty. And so that that needed to be secondary to all these other qualities. So that, yeah, I don't know. That's just something that I think about a lot is, and I'm still trying to undo a lot of those thoughts. And yeah, just like naturally valuing more, like my intellect and, you know, my like, thinking of myself as being either primary thinking being, or like someone who has a heart, but not actually thinking of myself as embodied as an embodied person, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's so good. I'm glad you brought that up. We have had a lot of conversations about embodiment and yeah. So before we have to wrap up, what are, what are some other things we've talked about a lot of them, but what do you feel like are some effects of it now and like things that are kind of residually in Christian culture from this movement? You know, just like kind of naming some of those, if someone's listening and are like, what are ways that this has affected me trying to process through that? Yeah. What are you, what are some thoughts that you have? I'm really glad Ruth mentioned the like purity ceremony because I feel like that one was really impactful for me because I'm the youngest of, I have three older brothers. I'm the youngest of four. And when my brothers reached, you know, what you would consider like a manhood in Christian culture or whatever, you know, they were like 13, right? But they, I remember each one of them had like this birthday party that was like, imparting like, oh, you like they had, they, you know, of course it was just really birthday. We had cake and everything, but there was this moment with each of them where, you know, dad sit over them with a Bible and spoke blessings and spoke prayers upon their life and said, you know, this is your, from this point forward, you need to be responsible for your actions and you need to be going forward and, you know, leading your community and your family in truth and God, you know, all of these things, like imparting, like you are now a leader, you are now expected to be a man of faith, like all these really cool things, in my opinion, you know, it's like, hey, we're speaking blessings over this person. Speaking identity into them. Right. Speaking identity into them and like imparting that, you know, as an adult, these are your responsibilities. And then when I turned 12, I had my purity ceremony and it was like, that's it? Like, that's all, that's all I get. Like, I'm not, I'm not a leader. I'm not supposed to be involved in the progression of our culture or my family or anything. It's just, okay, I'm not gonna have sex till I get married. Here's my ring. I promise God, I promise my dad. And now I'm just waiting for a dude to come that I hopefully respect and like, and am appreciated by, you know, like, I feel like that really imparted a lot of self. I feel like that told me a lot about what my culture believed in, in my worth of subconsciously, consciously, whichever way of like, yeah, they matter as humans and you matter for whatever human you're meant for. And, and that's it. Assuming you will be married, not having any messages for, yeah, singleness. Even now, of course not. No, almost like making it where you are for someone else. Yeah. Alone. Yeah. Like, you don't, you don't matter as your own. And I don't think that that's exactly what my parents were trying to impart to me. Right. Sure. But that was what was imparted, you know, of like, okay, this is, this is your send off into adulthood. And it's just promised to stay clean for whoever God has intended for you. And there's so many women that I knew that one didn't end up married and still are involved in this culture. And they are completely, I mean, I don't want to pretend to know I know what's happening in their brain from the outside. They seem to be completely lost and listless, you know, in their late thirties and have no prospects for marriage. And it sounds like I'm going into it Jane Austen novel. I'm already a burden to my parents. But like, this concept of like, oh, well, I've prepared my entire life to be a wife and mother. And now I'm not a wife and mother. And my window for achieving that is rapidly closing. Right. And that's what my identity is. And that's all that my identity ever was. And that's all I was ever prepared to be. And now I'm worthless as a human because I couldn't achieve that thing. Yeah. Yeah. And even like a prosperity gospel of like, if you save yourself, God will reward you with a marriage, be great sex. Yeah. Like all these things. And it's like almost a prosperity gospel of like, yeah, not only the deep, deep identity messages, but also prosperity gospel of like, well, this is your purpose. And there's a way to do it. This is your purpose. And therefore if you stay pure, then God will reward you with like, yeah. 100%. I think the formula, what you just mentioned, Brynn is so important because I do think that a lot of the teachings were, were pretty formulaic. Like if you do X, Y, and Z, then you will, you know, get married or at least have a happy marriage and your sex life is going to be great. And there's not going to be any, you know, any problems. And, and I think, and again, and this means that you are like, following God like that, you know, and you know, the irony of like the story of the prodigal son is that both of the sons missed out on relationship with the father. But the son who came back, that relationship was restored. And meanwhile, the older brother still was like actually missing, you know, like true intimacy with his father. And so, and he was doing all the right things and equating that with being connected with his father and he actually wasn't, you know. And so like, when you had these sort of formulas that was like, if you do this and you do this, then you will this. And so like, there's two things. One is like, there are a lot of people that probably were following all of these things and really, you know, from a biblical standpoint, did not have pure hearts, quote unquote, you know. And then, and then the secondary thing is that they may have been like following all of these things and still didn't have actual intimacy with their spouse, you know. Because maybe they didn't ever learn how to cultivate a healthy sexuality or maybe, you know, and then there are people that are still in this world now that again, it's like you might miss out on intimacy on both sides, like both with God and with others. And so, yeah, I don't know where I was going with that, but just kind of thinking through that of like going back to like, what does it mean to be pure and have an undivided heart towards the Lord? But still, when you equate that just with like one thing, you might miss the actual intimacy with the father or one day with your spouse. I had a friend who similarly was at one time had a man kind of start to assault her, verbally assault her and came back to her friend group and just, as she was processing the event, the first thing she said was, I was just wearing sweatpants. And it's just so ingrained. Like it was it was me. Yeah. And like, no, the other person clearly did not know how to respect boundaries. Yeah. And I don't think you can have this conversation. Oh, sorry. I just kind of like a caveat, which we've mentioned, but I really think it's hard to have this conversation about kind of the emphasis on period towards women without talking about like what Catherine already mentioned. The unhealthy patriarchal systems. And what I mean by that is like where men were not also called to accountability in the same way and or like misuse some of that to just to create harmful systems maybe for some women. But also having that abuse conversation has to be right next to it because it was again, I mean, it was just so prevalent. I don't think that was the intention, but I do think that was one of the outcomes is that women took responsibility for the actions of others rather than maybe in some situations recognizing as abuse because they've been in this culture that was saying, you know, if you're doing this, then you're being... Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think we have time this episode, but even like reading so much about, you know, even the messages that carried over into marriage of like, you're still responsible for your husband's purity. Like now that you're married, you are, you know, required to give him sex, you know, however often so that he can remain pure and like all those unhealthy, unbiblical conversations. Yeah, like didn't stop at marriage. I think you're right. It continued. But yeah, I know we need to wrap up for this one, but yeah. I want to hear Colson's thoughts. Well, can I say one thing and then we can throw it over to Colson. I know y'all need to go soon, but I think Ruth, you hit on such a valuable point that I like want to end on for like, at least my part of this. The conversation of behavior modification and missing the bigger picture, I think is the most detrimental part of this movement. There's so many like side effects that we've like listed some of them and there's even more, but like so many unhealthy things that came from this. But I think, yeah, the biggest part of that is like just missing the whole point altogether of like, yeah, what is instead of just a single behavior modification, like the relationship and what is purity and what does it mean to live for the Lord? What is forgiveness? Like what is restoration? Like all these biblical concepts just completely were tainted or destroyed in the misuse of scripture and kind of humans taking this on their own. And I think, yeah, I just, I thought that was really insightful Ruth of just like, man, one of the biggest overarching side effects in the list of many is, yeah, just missing the whole point of this and taking the beauty out of the conversation altogether and the dignity and the all of those messages that could have been really beautiful and instead were just really tainted. And I think that's why I'm so passionate about having these conversations because I think it's really important for as women particularly, but as a culture because you know, men were a part of teaching this as well. It has impacted them as well of kind of a deconstructing like we've talked about and talking about like, where did this go wrong? What, what were the effects of all of this? And then kind of starting back of like, okay, we're not, this is nuance. We're not going to say that just because something's been done poorly that all of it was wrong. Like, you know, that's just a reactionary response. Right. That would be understandable. And a lot of people have taken that path of, of just like, we're throwing every concept that was ever related out. Instead of it becoming like a snowball effect of like, okay, now we're not even going to touch anybody. It's just become like a hard line of like, okay, well, we're not gonna have sex. Right. We can do anything else. Yeah, but we're not gonna do this one thing, you know, and that's still pure, quote unquote. Right. Well, is it, you know, yeah. And just like having these nuanced conversations and kind of rebuilding and, and even like going to the other extreme of like, well, this was all taught poorly. Therefore we're just going to go the other extreme and do all of it. Like, you know what I mean? Like, whatever it is, having a healthy conversation, kind of going back to rebuilding this in a healthy way for women that have, and men that have been affected. So yeah, that's kind of my hope. I know we're kind of out of time, but Colson, did you have any thoughts? I'll be really brief. I think there was a lot that was like, I just found myself like, oh man, I hadn't really thought of that in this way. But like, man, I really like, for instance, like, we, I want to believe that that people wanted the value of like women to be in the right spot. But coming from at least, I can think back to like, being a teenager. And I'm like, it didn't accomplish what I wanted, what they wanted to for us. And it was just like, because where did what, what were a lot of our conversations as teenage boys? And I'm like, even as guys who were within the church, or whatever, it was like, it was just, it was purely on the physical side of things. So it's like, one, there was that side of things. It was, I feel like the attraction side of what you were talking about, Ruth, just hearing, especially for my wife, when we were either newly married or engaged and hearing that, that just, that really difficult thing of, am I attracted to them? Is that important? And then now on this side of things, like, it just, it breaks my heart really for like, I just, I'm like, not a great understanding of what that means. That then can carry over into marriage. I think consent is something that, that it's like, I, trying to teach that to, so I have a two year old son and a four year old son. And so it's like, I think that concept wasn't really taught very much at all. And I think, especially for young men. And I'm like, so I think that side of things then goes into, you know, what you were even talking about in marriage of, you know, it's not just this, well, all bets are off. And, and then you need to serve, you need to serve me kind of a thing. And it's like, I think also to what you were saying, Catherine is talking about, like, if we devalue somebody and their perspective and their voice, then how are we going to, like for years and years? And then it's like, then marriage happens. It's foolish to think that, well, now we're going to have these really healthy, you know, that's going to be entirely raised from your psyche. Yeah. I mean, completely. And so that with the level of like authority. And I think too, was interesting. I just remember like, feeling this burden of like, oh my gosh, I need to be a spiritual leader. But like, as a boyfriend, and it's like, I remember somebody saying, dude, you're not their spiritual leader. As like, as a teenager or like in dating. And I was just like, man, how much I had bought into this idea of like, well, but that's not my place until, you know, it's like, until you're married. Right. That or even just the biblical side of things, it's like, if we're not going to look at these things, if I'm going to take on a level of authority with a young woman when I was dating. And I'm like, this is messed up for me. And what's it messing up for her? Right. So I think there's that also the idea of like one person made for you. I, when you say that Ruth, I think I was like, dang, I, I really struggle with that and had a lot of people also struggle with that. But is this God's best for me? Yeah. And it's like, and well, and then it's like, oh, totally. And well, and then I think there was a level of like, after I got married. And I was like, oh, shoot, we're not perfect. And like, we didn't get along in some ways. And I'm like, so I'm like, then I'm, then I'm, I find myself like, okay, doubting like, is this, is this right? And I think that like the first year of marriage for me, because we've been married about almost 10 years, we got married the same year as Brynne and Mason. And so I think the big thing was like, man, marriage made me a horrible person. I just remember thinking that like, I used to be patient. I used to be like really sweet. And now like I'm married to you. And I think, and I had somebody tell me like, oh, yeah. I think what really, what really got me was we had somebody who was kind of counseling us early on. And I didn't take their counsel until after we were married as seriously. But it was like, maybe I've always been this selfish and maybe I've always been this impatient. And maybe it's not that marriage did this to me, but marriage is exposing this to me. And so that, that was a hard pill to swallow. And I will say this one, the one last thing is like, I was really, I think in, in the grand scheme of things of like, I grew up with around a lot of what you guys are talking about. And I've had to wrestle with a lot of that as in a, in a different way. I am really grateful that I had parents that truly loved each other and we're like, we're physical around us in a, in a healthy way to be like to as a model. So it's like, even with whatever baggage I took from them or took from my culture, I was very privileged to have parents that modeled things in a certain way. And so I think, which is so rare. Yeah. Which, and I'm like, but I didn't, I didn't realize that. And so anyway, I think overall, I'm really glad that y'all are willing to be vulnerable and have these tough conversations because I think it's just, it's really illuminating to like, because it, because it goes far beyond just your relationship with your spouse or significant other. It's like, how do I interact with people from, and I think that was another thing is like, okay, now for, if, if, if it's like, well, I'm going to push you back because I don't want to be attracted to you and then want to have sex with you and then have sex with you, you know, whatever. And it's like, okay, but I kind of damages all your relationships. So it's like, can you even have friendships after you're married with other people of the opposite gender? And it's like, if you haven't wrestled with that, it's like, I don't know. I think it deep down. Yeah, it does. Yeah. So anyway, I, yeah, I, I don't have anything to add. I'm just, I'm just like, I really, I really love that y'all's, y'all willing to have these conversations. One more thing I'd like to throw in. Sorry. I know we're trying to wrap up, but for me, I feel like this, this, this, well, we have a hurricane coming in and we're trying to get everything shuts down. Excuses, Catherine, excuse this concept of purity being equated with virginity, making it like a pass fail thing. I feel like really, really heavily impacted my relationship with God and was a huge part of my reason for leaving the church, because we talk about like all of this, you know, is intellectual in my head now. High and size 2020, but looking back and thinking, okay, you know, God values purity of heart, right? And, and purity of heart is equated with communion with God. And that means confession of, of sins and, you know, getting right with God. And that equates even to the non-religious side of things of like, oh, if I think I've done something wrong, I need to acknowledge it and I need to ask for forgiveness for it, right? To my husband or to my friends or whoever I've wronged. So this concept within women of, okay, you failed now, you are no longer pure. You are no longer a virgin. And like that shame and guilt being so tied in and that being a thing that now keeps you from your goal, because I don't want to confess that. I don't want to tell anybody that because now I'm going to be viewed totally different. And I'm going to be, and I'm living in shame and guilt with the way I've lived and the decisions I've made, you know, like, sure, I got pressured into it. I didn't get raped. So it's different now. It's definitely my fault because I didn't get raped, you know? And so now it's a choice I've made, but I feel so much shame over it and I can't go back and undo it. So why bother, you know, confessing this and trying getting right with God and trying to do X, Y, Z? And it just ends up alienating you from your entire community and from God because it's past fail. Like, it's like, okay, like I know, yeah, quote unquote, you can get born again and whatever, but now I'm tainted goods because of this perspective that was given. And so it's like all this shame just fully, I feel like does the opposite of like, you're the hardest community with God, which is acknowledgement of wrongs. Or at least that's my opinion, the Bible version of it. And it's like how damaging that is, you know, to someone who wants to be a Christian. Totally. I'm so glad you brought that up. That was actually a question I had written down to ask you that I hadn't gotten to. Yeah. But when it's like tied so closely with your identity and then is pass or fail and leaves out the rest of the gospel and God's like heart for love and forgiveness. And then it's like, oh, this is now my identity. Yeah. Like my pass or fail is now who I am. Like you're saying. Yeah. Every other sin feels like it's like a scale, you know, except for maybe murder, but like everything's like, okay, you know, well, I did this bad thing and why I confess it and God forgave me for it. And now we're okay again. And everything just feels like a tug of rope almost, which I know is not quite right. But you know, back good and evil back and forth. Well, it's like, this is just the rope got cut. You're done. Yeah. And then it's like how all these other people view me. That must be how God views me or how I think myself is obviously how God views me. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up. Yeah. And I think, I think even on the other side of that of like Ruth was saying for girls who like followed the rules all the way until marriage and then somehow was like, okay, God, like somehow I've earned your approval now of like, oh, somehow I have earned like salvation. I even heard some girls say, which is like a whole different thing. But, but like I've, you know, I've earned your approval. I've earned your, you know, and now it's almost like, look at me, God, like I've done this. I followed all your, you know, your rules. And then your relationship is then based on that, which is also like, yeah, I anyway, I'm really thankful you brought that up. But Ruth, were you saying something? Yeah. I just, this is like, I just am thinking about this because I'm going back to what I really feel like is at fault is, you know, this Gnostic heresy that seeped in. And, and I just want to, to reemphasize that Jesus became like, God became blessed, like Jesus was a man. And you have to read the gospels through this lens, because it helps make sense that part of the reason why the Samaritan woman in John four was so scandalous is because Jesus was talking with a woman who had been divorced five times. And he's just having a conversation with her because he sees her, he acknowledges her, he loves her, he invites her in a conversation and his disciples are like, Jesus, do you know who she like, what are you doing talking to a woman by yourself? Like, don't you know the Billy Graham rule? Like, hello. And, and Jesus is like, Hey, I have living water, you know, and then in the gospels and I get excited about this, right? But like a woman comes in, maybe a prostitute, and the Pharisees are like, does he know who she is? And Jesus is like, looking at her and seeing her and loving her and not going, Hey, your dress is too short. And hey, like your skirt is you need to you need to fix that. And like Jesus just looks at her. And like, that's what I want to follow. And it's not because Jesus was an asexual being, you know, like, not to get too explicit here, but like Jesus had all of the male genitalia. He was a man. And he, and he experienced the fullness of what it means to be a man, a human being. And I think it's much easier for us to not think about that side because it's uncomfortable. And it kind of brings up a lot of questions. But like the physical really matters. Now, did Jesus remain sinless? Absolutely. Was he perfect? Yes. And yet in his perfection, he chose to engage with people who broke the definition of modesty in that culture and who, and who broke the definition of what it meant to be pure. And in interacting with them, he was redefining again, what people had called evil and what people had called good. And he's just setting a new standard. And, and I think that's what a lot of some of his culture missed is like, first of all, the physical. Has it been tainted by the full? Yes. But you got to read Genesis one and two before you get to three and Genesis one and two is God books at male and female. And he says you both are made in my image, male and female. I created them our image made in God's image declared good. Then the fall happened, right? Sex existed before the fall. Sexuality existed before the fall. God called the good. Jesus came as a man. You know, like, those are just all things that, you know, if we don't really stop being a man. If we don't really stop to think about them. It's just easy to kind of fall into this pattern of calling with God called good evil and, and then just making rules that that break us from relationship but that's so good. I'm done. No, that's such a perfect way to end. And I just want to say if you're listening and you still are wanting more, still feel like discouraged in some way, like we are going to continue having this conversation just because that's our goal for this podcast is not to just deconstruct, but also say like, can we reconstruct? What are things that are actually healthy? What does the Bible actually say? Like, what can we even have these conversations in a dignifying? Yeah, encouraging way. So we are going to continue this conversation. But I'm just so thankful for both of you and your vulnerability and your ability to be articulate and gracious and dig into hard conversations. I value both a lot as friends and also as just our guests today. So thanks for being here. But yeah, thanks for listening. I know. I feel like we could have just kept going. I know. I know. It's like Catherine and I probably need to get back. Well, I got to work. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Well, yeah, sorry. No, it's fine. Wonderful. That was good. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. Man, it just opened so many doors. I'm like, I know we could go there. We can just dive right in. I know. I almost am like, should we do another one? I don't know if we covered every. Yeah. Okay. I love it. I think it'd be worth. I think it'd be worth doing another one. I totally do. Okay, cool. I also, I just want to add this, but I don't know if you can put like something at the beginning of the podcast of like some sort of apology or just trigger warning because of like the topics that are being talked about. And then also just, yeah, just maybe an apology of like, Hey, I'm sorry for those of you who are still working through because I think we all are in that working through phase. But yeah, that's a good thought. I can't even remember. My male genetic comment. Is that too explicit? I'm always looking forward to it. Do you know who is normally on this podcast? Chris, I'm telling you. Chris Legg says that from the stage. Oh, he says, wave works. Great. I knew I liked it. Yeah. I really feel like, like I would, I didn't get as explosive as I could, but like Jesus probably had erections. How do we feel about that? Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Well, and I, but I liked what you said, what you said of like, that brings up a whole lot of other things. Cause I was like, oh yeah, if you haven't thought of that, then when you think of it, it's like, oh shoot. Well, what is that? What all is that? Who all is that? Jesus. My white Jesus. My white Jesus. Yeah. I love my white Jesus with his blonde hair and blue eyes. Surely he, his perfectly white clothes without dirt or sweat. Yeah. But like you can't read the gospels well, unless you are placing him as a man in the first context and seeing why some of his conversations were so scandalous. Like he really, he would have been outcast by, you know, by everyone. And that was my other thing is I don't know how much of this is limited to like a lot of the mostly Anglo evangelical subculture. And I, I didn't feel like we necessarily hit that nuance, but I will say that I totally ran into purity culture in Peru when I was there my senior year. And I was like, that was actually, okay, this is crazy because Catherine hit on the question that I had written down for her. And that was my question for you of like, have you seen this in other subcultures cultures other than just like white evangelicalism? Oh my goodness. Okay. Maybe we can hit that. Maybe we can do it. Maybe we can do number two in a couple weeks. What kind of Peru were you in? Because I spent a lot of time in Peru too. I was in, it was called Pachacamoc. It was like Southern Lima. Yeah. Were you in Peru? No, yeah, I spent a lot of time in Peru. Also, I was in Monaco, which is like north east of Lima, quite a bit. And it's really, really poor. Still has pretty heavy catch you in influences as well. And I was working at a school for girls actually. And the sexual assault is just horrifically. It's horrific. It's horrific in Peru. Yep. Like every, I, I, most of Latin America. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it was so crazy. Like listening to them talk and like one of the girls, I remember like her grabbing me and she'd be like, literally asked me, she's like, are you a virgin? And I was like, yes, I'm 17 at the time. I was like, yes. And she was just like, so like, jealous and like upset. Because she's just like, oh my goodness, what a gift, you know, what a gift. And, you know, because like most of these girls had been abused their entire life or, you know, couple of them came from a drug cartel that they had been kept as slaves in the basement, you know, from the time they were like nine, like horrible, horrible stories, you know, and it's just like this concept that it's just this gift. And man, I just wish I could have that, you know, and it's just so heartbreaking. I was like, well, you didn't give that up. That was pretty aggressively stolen from you. And the fact that you're taking on any guilt of any kind for that, like, oh, awful. Well, and that I think that's part of like, what's complicated, and we didn't even get into this is like, this is a subset of the US culture to an extent. But when you look at modesty standards worldwide, we are actually more liberal than most places. And so, yeah, there is this sort of complicated nuanced conversation about like, growing up, you know, in the homeschool community, where we were all wearing skirts, like, actually, is maybe more common and like, you know, certain and usually, yeah, or in, in more conservative places in the majority world. And so, there is this kind of push and pull of like, we're having this conversation in like the United States context. But like, if I'm a Muslim woman living in the majority world, I'm probably going to be way more covered and actually not even on Muslim, a lot of Christians were head coverings in other countries, too, you know. So, it's also interesting, because it's like, we're pushing back against like part of this culture, but then how much of our pushback is also culturally informed? Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And that's how you search for answers.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.48, "text": " Welcome to Reconstructed Faith, a podcast where we talk about truth you can build your", "tokens": [50363, 19134, 284, 23419, 16242, 16463, 11, 257, 9905, 810, 356, 1561, 546, 3872, 345, 460, 1382, 534, 50837], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19700809671908995, "compression_ratio": 1.4759615384615385, "no_speech_prob": 0.1546456664800644}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 9.48, "end": 15.280000000000001, "text": " life on.
