We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes here in studio and Chris Sherrod joining us in Dallas. I did want to just say that with our continuing struggle of making sure that we can get the best audio possible, there might be a little bit of just some kind of robotic sounding in Chris Sherrod's voice, but no worries. Thank you for thinking. He hasn't actually become a robot. He's not a robot. He's still just a connection issue. Dallas hasn't changed in that much. So thank you for bearing with us as we figure that out. We are grateful and we are jumping back in to conversation about sexism in the Bible. So we talked some... This is like our fourth or fifth episode. This has been great. This is really awesome. We thought it was going to be two episodes. Here we are. But no, it's awesome. A quick recap. We've talked a little bit about an overview, then we've hit things in the Old Testament, like as far as rape laws and other things like that. And then we transitioned to what does Jesus say about this? Yeah, but Jesus taught directly. And so do we have more? Is that kind of what we're continuing to talk about now? Or what are we talking about now? I think we wrapped up the conversation on Jesus pretty well as to kind of his treatment of and that he would have been considered progressive and even he clearly was offensive to some of the established people at the time with how he treated women with gentleness and kindness and dignity in a way that was not culturally demanded or probably normative. And given the way some of the religious leaders replied to him, he apparently just defensive. Now, much less offensive to us in 2022 because it's how we would hope people would treat each other. But anyway, but at its time, he was kind of head of the curve when it came to that. Yes. But he's not the only person in the New Testament and certainly not the only person who referenced or talked about women. Right. So now we're moving into more of the letters and the early church. That's right. And some fun, hot topics. Yeah. So yeah. Just moving into that. I mean, yeah, they all they all connect to each other so we can start whichever you want to start where you guys want to start. I mean, I think it's it's cool to start with. We can break into the specific passages, but some things that I think it's important to remember when talking about the coming of the church is just some generalities of even the the beginning of the new church. So whether it's acts or recorded in the letters, but like men and women both received the Holy Spirit at the beginning. Paul mentions women as partners in the faith and deaconesses and highly speaks of them as people who are partners in the faith and even outworking in this is is actually probably a twist on the language. It's just Deacon Deacon. Yeah. The Greek word is Deaconess. And so it sounds like Deaconess, which sounds like Deaconess, but that's male and female. Right. And so it's a Phoebe from Roman 16 is a Deacon. In fact, the Deacon of a specific church. Yeah. And then Priscilla and Aquila. She's always mentioned first, I think, which is weird. Yeah, that's weird. But I don't know that that means anything. Yeah. That's how you do people's names. You've done that wrong. It's clearly brand new. I've done it is not Mason and Bryn. Most people sound more right. I mean, they sound better with one name first for whatever reason. Not that. Yeah. Not that I'm one of those. There's a book I recently in the author. Probably it's pronounced Aquila, Aquila and Priscilla. And so that is you would never say it that way. You don't say Priscilla and Aquila. You would never say it the other way. Anyway, just having fun with it. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. But I think that's helpful to just as an overview. Yeah. In fact, I'll just comment in the early, some of the early translators because of their culture had a problem with this. Some of the ways that women were so highly regarded scripturally. The passage you were referencing, Romans 16 also mentions Junia. And it says the passage says she was well known among the apostles. And no one knows exactly how to translate that. Like, man, you asked the apostles about Junia and they all knew who she was. Or she was well known as one of the apostles. Yeah. And so apostle just means sent. It doesn't have to mean anything beyond that. Yeah. The sent ones. But that would be obviously a pretty high significant position of some kind recognition. But many early church translators changed her name to the masculine. Interesting. Because they were kind of uncomfortable with the thought of a feminine, a person with a female name being connected so closely to apostleship. So we can see humans do sometimes mess this stuff up. But yeah, we we've learned to wrestle through it here. We yes, that's one of our favorite things. So those things that you just mentioned to me, or to us, they don't sound very, you know, controversial or anything. But there are some of the some interpretations or things that are said that are hard to understand. Yeah, yeah. It was a very sexist. Yeah, they're controversial, but not in the way you're thinking. Okay. Not for people deconstructing their faith. Yes. Sometimes for people within the faith, they can be controversial. Okay. Right. Gotcha. Right. So what do you so then what do we want to dive into right now? Well, I want to dive into a couple of passages. Yeah, exactly. There's there's two or three main ones. What do you think are from the standpoint of it would be from a standpoint of deconstruction. So it would be hard for this may be a roadblock for someone in their faith. Yeah. What you got, Chris? What's movie if we just go off? I mean, alphabetically, in order isn't the first Corinthians first Corinthians? Yeah, that's kind of the first one reading. Yep. First Corinthians 11 would be a good place to start. First Corinthians 11. We're going to be what about verse six ish? No, back further about head coverings. Starting in 11 to I'll start this one. Now I commend you because you remember me and everything and to maintain their traditions, even as I delivered them to you. But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ and the head of a wife is her husband. And the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. But every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. For a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. This is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels or messengers. Nevertheless, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man nor man of woman. For as woman was made from man, man is born of woman. And all things are from God. Judge for yourselves the proper for a wife to pray with God with her head uncovered. Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair, it is disgraceful for him. But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory. For her hair is given to her for a covering. If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God. There you go. Good. All right. We're good. Yeah. In quote. Okay. I see, I see here how this might be a stumbling block for people who don't understand. Yeah. It does feel weird and strange and counter cultural or, or something and, and sexist because of men and women. Yes. Or even from a different perspective, like, well, it may seem like some believers are being hypocritical because it's like, Oh, well you don't follow these things. So yeah, you grow your hair out. Right. Right. Yeah. Okay. So one, we're not going to get into it because it's very in depth and not entirely family friendly, probably. But I want to ref recommend the naked Bible podcast episode 86 in which those guys really unpack the question of what Paul says down here that we have that would leave us totally scratching our heads when he says, does not nature even teach that men should have short hair and women should have long hair. That means nothing to us. Like, no, that's not that there's nothing about nature with that. Men can have long hair. Women can have short hair. There's nothing in the length of your hair has to do with when you cut it, not nature. Right. Right. All of us grow long hair if we don't cut it. And so you said episode 86. Episode 86 and the naked Bible podcast. They really, they really work hard and dig into this and do a lot of good historical medical work to uncover how, how at the time people understood hair. And I'll just leave it there. So you can, we're not going to unpack that piece of it here, but that really isn't a sexist thing. That's just an odd thing. That's a cultural thing. We're like, what does that have to do with medical understanding at the time? Yes, exactly. So we can unwrap that. But what about this idea? I mean, what, okay. So, uh, what feels sexist within that passage? I mean, I feel like there are a few things that the man is the glory of God and the woman is the glory of man. That seems yeah. Yeah. Um, women need their head covered before the Lord, but men don't right. Feels subordinate, subordinate, or even like they don't have the same access to God. Maybe. Right. Okay. Good thought. What were you going to comment about? There's a feels like there's someone between the woman and God, like in order for her to go to God, she's got to go through her husband. Yeah. Okay. Or she has to be more respectful in front of God than men do or something. Okay. Yeah. So it's, it's good to know. And, and I know Chris will comment on this, if not here in other places as well, that this is, this is in particular, not about men and women. This is about husbands and wives. So first let's set aside the idea that this is fundamentally sexist. This doesn't mean that, you know, Colson has some kind of authority over Bren. Right. So even if you understood this in its most literal traditional way, this doesn't put men in authority over women. It just puts a specific man in authority over his wife. Go ahead, Chris, what are we going to add to that? Well, I, I know we've talked many times before about context. This is, this is kind of Paul. It seems like the Corinthian church had a lot of problems and they were tolerating stuff. They shouldn't have tolerated and we're proud of it. And we're confused some on people being offended with food sacrifice to idols versus not. And he's going to talk in just a little bit about even the Lord's supper and how, yeah, speaking of weird things, Christians believe in God. Yeah. I mean, just how they're not, they were not functioning like a normal church. You think of with order and you got people showing up drunk for the Lord's supper or I mean, they're, they're already doing that or they're, they're not waiting for everyone to show up. And this is another thing I think where he's trying to explain people from a pagan background and the way the world naturally thinks to, okay, but here's how things need to function here. And whenever you see stuff, and whenever you see stuff, and this is true of reading, even in Ephesians five about marriage is, it's describing different roles, but it's your role, not your rank. And so when you read for, when we read, for example, he says that the head of every man is Christ and that of a wife is her husband and that of Christ is God. This goes back to theology that theologically Christ is not inferior. He's equal. And yet in his role and coming into the earth, the father sends the son, the son sends the Holy Spirit, the son submits to the will of the father. So in their roles and how things are playing out, submission is part of that, but it has nothing to do with their value or equality in any form. So when you read there that the husband's head of the wife, it just means, hey, he's the leader, he's responsible and he's going to be leading. But then if you couple that with, okay, Ephesians five tells you how to do that. Right. He's literally laying down his life, putting his wife first, loving her like Christ. It's not a domineering thing at all. And so that's where probably a lot of women in particular, but people don't like that word, submit wife, submit, or the husband is the head because you have seen bad examples. You have seen terrible examples of men who think the way the world naturally thinks that, well, that means I'm telling you what to do and you're my servant versus what Jesus had to explain to the disciples was now it's totally the upside down to the world. I'm not here to be served, but to serve and to give my life. And that's how we'd all live it out. So even on an initial reading there, if we're trying to figure out what does it mean, the head of husband is Christ and the head of whatever right away, just going, okay, we need to clear your thinking on what does it mean to be the head? It is, has nothing to do with your value or worth or anything like that. And here's like to point out, Paul's not making a competition necessarily here with these things. Look at look at seven and eight for a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image of glory of God or the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. Now look at that and you go, oh, so men are created in the image of God. Yeah. Well, what we just looked at that passage, which Paul was obviously very aware of last two weeks. What does that passage actually say? Genesis one 27, that men and women, male and female were created in his image. Well, Paul's not ignorant of that. Paul hasn't like, right. Oh, I forgot that's in there. That both of them are. I've not looked at that one in a while. He's not saying, same when he says, man is the image and glory of God. He's not saying in this passage that women aren't the image and glory of God. He's saying there's a sign that when women is all women are also the glory of man in addition to that because of the creation from man. And again, you're dealing with the apostle Paul, who obviously has a very traditional understanding of the creation story from Genesis. He's going to take it as an absolutely, probably absolutely literal, which again is totally appropriate. But he's, when he's doing this, just recognize he is retelling essentially the creation story here. And it's not that women are inferior anymore than as Chris share just said, that Christ is inferior to God, the Father, even though there's an authority structure given in this passage for them. I think that's important. He I think he summarizes it when he says in verse nine, man was not created for a woman, but woman for man. That is quite literally the order of creation. It wasn't woman walking around and God's like, man, she needs some help. That chick, that chick, she needs some help. It was Adam walking around the God's like, wow, man, the boy needs some help. Yeah. And so that's that is nothing. That passage is clearly literally woman was created to help man who apparently needed help. It wasn't that man was created to help woman who needed help. And, and that's that I don't think he's making any statement there other than no, I mean that literally man was woman was created to help the boy who needed some help. So, and that's why the woman needs this symbol. By the way, you got to love that's a symbol of authority on her head. And he goes to this whole thing about long hair, which is very Jewish and very Greek. And he goes into that. We don't know exactly the, you know, she needs the symbol of authority on her head because of the angels or maybe the messengers like, but that's clearly for outside of meaning for outside observers that that they can see that she sees herself as humble, that she's not trying to, and that may be connected. You talked yesterday off air when you're talking about Corinth and most of the ancient Greek cities had a God and a goddess. So in Corinth, you had Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sex and fertilization and all that kind of stuff. And I mean, fertility, fertility, fertility. And, and so, and so that there was a big cult of worship of Aphrodite, of feminine power. Female led. Yeah. Yeah. And so part of this probably also connects the fact that Paul's saying, listen, when people look in on you, they need to tell that you don't see yourself in that same light. Yeah. Like brazen. And yeah, yeah, that's interesting. It's like a pagan power woman or something. It isn't interesting that in today's world, the Wicca movement, the witchcraft movement has, has so embraced the women power movement, because paganism is about power and witchcraft is about female pagan power. And, you know, if you're looking for personal power, God's not where you go. If you're looking to submit to power, those are some good, I'm curious, Chris made some good points there as well. Jesus is my head and he suffered and died for me. That's apparently what it means. Shepherding is the right mindset. When we think of leadership in the West, we think of people driving cattle with whips and guns. Right. In the Middle East, when they're talking about leading, they're thinking about shepherding, someone who is tending to flock at their own expense, possibly. So. Which I think was just as a side note on submission. I know we can talk about that for a long time, but we've talked about this on the podcast before, but I'm like not, I, I enjoy talking about this because I'm not a personality who comes across as I'm not a very mild personality. I'm not like submission. I think before I learned the real true biblical version of what submission is, it does put a bad taste in your mouth. Like I'm feisty. I don't like the idea of what the world has presented. What the, I think what the world views as biblical submission. I'll put it that way. Kind of pathetic capitulation. Yeah. And, and so I think that was transformational for me understanding a lot of these passages, even like you're saying the ones that, that do speak to submission and some of them we'll talk about word cultural or whatever, but, but I think, you know, even in Philippians too, where we are all called to like mutual submission, right? To follow Christ's footsteps of, we're all called to submit as Jesus submitted and it's not presented as something that is weakness. It's more of a heart posture before the Lord. What's the verse we're all called to submit to one another Ephesians five, five 20. Yeah. What'd you say about five 20? Yeah. Submitting to one another. So mutual submission. And, and so I think just as a, as a feisty woman, I think that was really helpful for my understanding of the gospel and even biblical marriage of how it can be beautiful. Because I think the world's view of biblical submission is very distorted. And even like we've talked about before, the ways that the word submission has been misused in the church and in Christian communities or abuses that have happened in families or whatever under the auspice of quote unquote submission, taints our taste of that word. And we have to go back to, to that. But you've heard me teach about it and I often will use the word devote instead of submit. Right. Because again, we've talked about how, you know, the other, many of the other religious writings, I think we talked about this a few episodes ago from this time period, women were not, were not treated as moral free agents. It was husbands submit your wives, husbands force your wives into submission. And what makes Paul a revolutionary when it comes to this is that Paul's family code says, women, you have a responsibility. Like I would, I would literally say, I don't know that it could ever be appropriate for a husband to tell his wife to submit. It's her job to submit to her husband's leadership in Christ, not in her husband's leadership. Like that's his, he's, unless he's somehow perfected sacrificing for her and serving her, I don't know where he would get a get off saying, telling his wife, Hey, here's how you need to apply scripture. I guess God is, can speak directly to her and does. And anyway, it just, it just strikes me as such a dangerous mindset that when, and it's why, how it's been abused is by people throwing around, I'm bigger and stronger. So I'm going to use this Bible verse and hit you over the head with it in an abusive way. And, you know, I guess wives could have done the same thing. If maybe that's the issue is the wives could have said, well, I don't see you sacrificing for me, like Jesus sacrifices for the church. So, you know, let me know when you got that down and then we'll talk. But when we focus on somebody else's behavior, it's always going to be bad. But the idea of submission biblically is, I mean, you know, you've got family member in the military. My best friend was a Navy SEAL. And when we watch Navy SEAL movies together, he'd always joke when Navy SEALs ignored orders. Like when they would get an order, you know, you stay here and you're here's your sniper position. And then they would decide partway through like, no, I've got a better idea with how to use my time. And he would just start laughing. Like, you know, you're right. Like, that's gonna, that would never, ever, ever, ever, ever. He's like, I don't know enough ever. It's never going to happen. He is given an order. You stay here. This is your job. Well, I've made a different decision. I didn't ask you to think. I didn't ask for you. Navy SEALs are not passive. They're not weak. They're not pathetic, but they are submissive. Which is under, you've taught on that before. Both of you. I've heard both Chris's teach on sub meaning under mission, you're just under the mission. You're making the mission of another happen. That's right. Which is very empowering to me. That's right. It doesn't, I get that it gets been abused. And we've talked about that before. Nothing of what we're saying here means you've never been abused with this. You've not heard this taught badly. You've not had been married to somebody who was a narcissistic or abusive or terrible person who abuses these things. That just, I don't believe in any way was Paul's intent. I think, I don't think it was Paul's intent. So we've looked at the, some of this one, I don't know if we've unpacked this one enough or not the first Corinthians one. And so when it comes to like head coverings, so would you say, and maybe this is complicated. Did you want to say something else real quick shared about that? Is that where you were saying? Well, no, I was going to say again, Paul, Paul equals a playing field when he says one was made from man, but then he says some man is now born a woman. Right. Like now it's, we're just as dependent. It's not like anyone is more, it's just the first time the chicken or the egg thing, but the first time, yeah, came out of the man. But then after every time after that, every man in existence came from a woman. So it's right. And everything came from God, which is really what it comes down to. Right. Right. As far as the head covering. So I think, I think what we have to do, we talked about hermeneutics, you look for the principle here. And what is the principle? And the principle is, is it does the wife want to display to the world that she respects her husband's leadership? Mm hmm. And, and in their day, a head covering was the proper way to show that, apparently. Which is why it says judge for yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray with her head uncovered? And actually, we're going to come back to that. Verse five says every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered. We're going back to the fact that Paul is assuming women pray and prophesy, by the way. Yeah, publicly in charge. Yeah, publicly. So I also heard that like, if you're like a lot of times back then, like a prostitute, they would have short hair or their heads are shaved. And so even his argument there, he's like, how are you trying to look? Are you trying to, you know, what, what like the, are you wanting to show the world that you're submitting your husband and that you're, even that you're taken, but also what message are you sending if your head's all short and shaved, which obviously today short hair wouldn't say that, but in their culture. It is different than that. That's connected to the, some of the pagan worship too. Temple prostitution was a huge issue in Athens, whose God was Athena, not surprising. Ephesus, whose God was Artemis, goddess, these are our goddesses, goddess was Artemis and Corinth, whose goddess was Aphrodite. And so temple prostitution was a common issue. Women or boys or men who worked in the temple and you would go and pay for their prostitution services to the temple. And they were usually slaves and probably pretty horribly treated, probably the ancient version of sex slavery. And so one of the things that, that certainly there are times when it seems like what Paul is saying is make sure that you don't look like somebody who practices this pagan practice, that you're not part of this pagan practice. Yeah. Because hair was considered more sexual back then, I think. That's part of it. And again, that Naked Bible podcast unpacks that idea of its role in regards to sexuality. So I think, I think there's, I can understand why it feels weird here, but I think in the same way that a husband should go out of his way to show that he loves and sacrifices for his wife publicly. What Paul is instructing is that the women understand you have a responsibility to show your love and respect for your husband. And he is saying head covering is a good way to do it. What's wild about this is, and I don't know what it was then, but today, Jewish men are what who wear head coverings in order to acknowledge the authority of God over them. And so it's intriguing that at some point, either this switched or traded or Paul was making it different. We really don't know why exactly he chose this the way he did or why modern day Judaism men were the Yarmulke thing on their heads that is meant to imply and meant to indicate that the authority of God over them. But what I would say is I don't know that that would be a wrong application of this principle, even if it is, okay, men start wearing head coverings and women don't wear head coverings as long as the purpose of it is to show, listen, we're under the authority of God and we're under earthly authorities as well. And we want to respect that and acknowledge that. We do have a woman in our church who wears a head covering because of this passage. She doesn't ask anybody else to do it. She just says, I feel like it's important for her. It's kind of like, you know, Paul McKenzie calling me boss. He doesn't do that because he's like, doesn't know me or we're not good friends because we are. Or that you demand that. No, certainly not. And I called a former boss of mine, Captain, every time I saw him, I was like, Hey, Captain, how do I, and it was to remind me and him, Hey, I defer to you. You're leading here. When we start this conversation, let's both of us keep in mind you're leading the conversation. And, and that's just a, it's just a sign of respect. And it's not a bad thing. It's like saying yes, sir, or no ma'am or whatever. It's still, I really think that's what Paul's trying to accomplish here is to say, don't be afraid to show respect. Don't be afraid to show this difference. So this is 1 Corinthians. What did it come up? 11. Yeah. 11. And we read kind of verse one through 11. Can we unpack another passage in the next, oh yeah, we can go to 14 next. Yeah. 1 Corinthians 14. So 14 is probably even more challenging in some ways. 14 verse, uh, what is it? 34. Yeah. 33, 34. Yeah. This is fun. So let me, let me, yeah, I'm going to pre, yeah, start with 33. I think that's a good place to start. And we'll talk about this and the Timothy passage to here. Yeah. Sharon, if I could just say again, this is all context. The flow of the thought really starts in verse 26 about how in the church services, people are speaking out and blurting out and other languages. And there's no interpretation. It's tongues gone awry. It's like chaos. And it's a disorderly service that he's trying to calm down. So just like a lot of these things we're dealing with, if you're just going to lift that one verse out and just go, women must be silent. You're missing what's going on here. Is he's trying to help you understand your attitude, your reverence and everything that's been going on there. So again, we don't have to read it, but I just want to make sure people understand we're going to pick up right in the middle of him saying things have got to be done in an orderly way. It is out of control. Yeah. The church is out of control. Break like, yeah, right. It's just all the way through. Yeah, that's good. Um, so that being said, you want me to start reading in 33 33 is probably pretty good as long as people through 35. Okay. Yeah. So picking the verse right out of the middle of the paragraph, right in the middle. Um, start with 33 though. What did it say? For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. Wait, let me see which I was checking my which version. Okay. Um, for God is not, oh, where did he go? So hold on. Okay. For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace as in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silent in the churches for they are not permitted to speak, but they should be in submission. As the law also says, if there's anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. And I think that's all the time. Was that a mistake? Bring was just speaking and we're in church. Uh, oh. Oh, no. It doesn't say in the podcast. Does it not say that either? Okay. So clearly, what's that? Should be parallel to go ahead and bring in the other, the verse and Timothy just to show. Yeah. Yeah. If you want to do the first Timothy two. Um, yeah, if you want to jump over to it, or I've got it pulled up and it's first Timothy two, I would start in verse eight, but so again, keep in mind. So this is Paul's letter to a young pastor in Ephesus. Um, Ephesus is a, is a deeply devoted city to Artemis. Um, they're goddess. Um, and so again, you might, there might be some very special things going in here, but the message of Timothy is Paul telling Timothy, um, do not let the message get disrupted. Do not let it happen. And everything that is to older men, younger men, older women, younger women, everything in Timothy essentially is summarized as don't get distracted from the message. And he does it over and over again. Do not get distracted. This young pastor in this very difficult place, probably to be a pastor. If you want to read about it, by the way, acts 19, the whole chapter is all about Paul getting there and a riot that was started all because of this worship of Artemis. That was the center of their whole, their whole commerce really was centered around. So it's a good one to refer back to. You want to Colson, are you there? I'm here. Okay. One first, first. I mean, now you got the pass. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I'm tracking. Uh, first. Yeah. Start in verse eight, first, Timothy two starting in eight. Okay, great. And go to the end. Cause I mean, it's yeah. Okay, great. I desire that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling. Likewise, also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, but with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works. Let a, let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I did not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man. Rather she is to remain quiet for Adam was former was formed first, excuse me, then Eve and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith and 11 holiness with self-control. There you go. So again, it's a pretty similar in some ways. Yeah. So, so Chris, do you want to go back first and reference? So the first Corinthians 14 in this first Timothy two pass about women not speaking up so much in church, but we just read in first Corinthians 11 about in an orderly service, how women are supposed to pray and prophesy. How do you, how do you integrate those? Well, so I think in particular, it's just talking about when someone is teaching, I mean, in the end during the service and it, what, from what it sounds like in first Corinthians, because he just got done saying things are sending confusing and out of order that possibly women were blurting out stuff interrupting, like talking out loud and it was just becoming probably more of a distraction. Interestingly, I, I think this goes back to a lot of the way you, you read stuff when it says, if she has a question, she should talk to her husband about it. Again, I think it's helping remind them, like he said earlier, like, I need you to let, let your husband lead, like, let the guy tread a lead. Like, there's so many times as, as the husbands feel like, okay, but my wife, she's way better at praying than me, or she's way more knowledgeable of scripture, but I can't use that as an excuse to go. So therefore I don't need a lead. And I think a lot of times women that are like, Bren is, and like my wife is more feisty and controlling. They're perfectly fine with, I didn't say controlling earlier. I'm just kidding. I noticed that too, the land tutorial thrown in there. Y'all may need to talk later. It can be intimidating for husbands who feel like I'm not as deep or spiritual and therefore I'm not qualified. And God's like, I didn't pick you to lead because of your moral superiority or because of your, you know, perfect record. I'm asking you to lead in a servant leadership type way. And so, and I've actually read the first Corinthians 14 passage as one way that Paul is trying to empower the husbands and say, listen, if you've got questions, wait until you get home and let your husband try to unpack this with you and let him lead a little bit rather than keep asking every time. And I think I see it as a way of him trying to encourage the husbands sometimes rather than we're just trying to get women to stop talking. Yeah. Chris, I'm even curious. Have you ever thought about this? That he's telling the women they need to go home and ask their husbands instead of who? I don't know. You mean him? Himself. Instead of Paul? Himself or Timothy. Paul would rather the women have this conversation with their husbands than with an apostle of Jesus Christ. Paul, I think, is purely trying to empower the marriage here and trying to empower the husbands and the wives and saying, listen, don't ask me first. First, you talk to him about it. The two of you talk about it. And she's going, well, he's an idiot and you're an apostle. And he's like, I hear you talk to him first. And I think if you come back to Paul, now again, this isn't in the Bible, but this is my tendency. So I led a ministry for a long time, taught in the ministry for a long time called Womenary. So yeah, that's kind of a great name. And so it was seminary level training for women only. And so I was supposed to teach these 20 hour classes on like soteriology or pneumatology or whatever. And about how I'd been teaching it two or three years when I realized, I mean, half the class is questions. And I realized I really enjoyed the attention and the admiration and the respect of all these women in the room who are asking me the expert questions. And I realized I was not following Paul's example here of saying, you know what? Here's what we're going to do. It's totally okay for you to ask me a question, but I want you to ask your husband the same question also. I can't want you just to do that. I think it'd be healthier on your marriages, rather than you're going home and like, well, Chris said, or will Paul said, will Timothy's and instead saying, what do you think about this? Here's what I think about this. And what a great intimate conversation for a spiritually intimate conversation for a couple to have. So again, the practicality of it is this Paul saying, you know, I just think women don't ask good questions. They're just not as smart as men. And so I just don't want to hear their thoughts. I mean, it's possible, but I don't, I don't, that doesn't seem to fit with the big picture. Is it also possible that this is Paul saying, listen, culturally speaking, it's rude for a woman to speak up in front of a group of men. Obviously that is also possible. Now, here's what strikes me though about that. So I wanted to, I wanted to reference something because someone threw this out recently. So I'm going to, I want to jump over. I'm going to take a point. I'm going to make a point with something. I'm going to look at 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10. This is Paul writing again to Corinthians. Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, no men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. Now that's a list that he puts together of, of these specific sins that if people are living in these sins, embracing these sins, identified by these sins, it's going to cost them knowing God. You notice with that list, I can't go in and just pull one thing out of that list and go, you know what? Homosexuality must have been cultural. So I'm going to pull that out because that was just cultural and drunkenness. That was cultural. I want to pull that out. The rest of them still apply, but I'm going to pull these two out of the list. You would say, that's not good hermeneutic. You can't do that. You either have to say the whole list is like a list put together like this by Paul. Okay. You know what? None of this really applies to us. Or it all applies to us. Like you can't, you see what I'm saying? It's a bad idea. Now jump back to the passage we were just looking at. I know we're running out of time here, but for today. Yeah. And I will say if Bryn and Chris need to leave for their meeting, I still want to see you. Yeah, I can close out. Yeah. I want to hear that. So I noticed back where we were in Timothy, I desired in every place, the men should pray lifting holy hands. Okay. Do we command that? Do we come, do we prescribe the men lift hands in church? No, we don't. No, we don't. Modesty that women should adorn themselves with respectful peril, modesty and self-control. Yep. Those are good principles, but the application not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly attire. No, we decided these are principles that we need to apply, but not prescriptive behaviorally. Yeah. Right. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to then go down to verse 11 and say, this isn't principle. This is behavioral prescription. Right. Because either the list applies or the list doesn't. And in this situation, I think as, and by the way, I think rightly most churches have said, yes, these are vital principles, modesty, humility, non-competition with each other, not quarreling, not angry, authentic worship, recognizing authority, being submissive and humble. These are all vital principles, but the direct applications at some point, we've apparently decided not to make them prescriptive, or we've decided Paul didn't really mean them to be like, okay, I don't literally mean every man has to raise his hands all the time. In service, I don't literally mean no woman can ever wear gold or pearls again, or braided hair again. I don't literally mean that. I mean the principle. I think that's what we've done with these rightly, is we said these are vital principles and they're very important. That doesn't mean there aren't people who have abused them. Right. And so anyway, I just wanted to compare that to say, just because we look at one list and say, this list seems culturally contextual, and we need to figure out how to apply its context to our culture. And then there's other lists that we go, no, this is a specific list of moral behaviors. And unless we're willing to lose all of them, we really can't just lose any of them. It's a sophisticated, can be complicated understanding. Anyway, I know we're there running out of time today. Wonderful. And there'll be other passages correct that we're going to unpack, probably. Okay, that's great. Go ahead, Chris. Well, do we want to end with a thought on a woman we saved through childbearing? Yeah. Why don't you close that out that way? And if somebody needs to bail, they can't. So the context, again, appears that Paul and his brain is thinking back to the fall and the curses that were pronounced on women because of that, which is the effect of the fall is going to be, he says to Eve, your desire will be for your husband. And that word desire is not a positive one because it's used in the next chapter to talk about sin desires to master you. But the other consequences are going to be pain and childbirth, childbearing. And so when it talks about the Adam is formed first and even he was deceived again, he's just saying the facts. He's not giving value to women are worse off because she's the one that Satan specifically addressed and deceived because we know Adam is deceived apparently, but he also sinned. But also, in other places, Paul only talks about it's Adam's, you're in Adam, it's Adam's responsibility. Adam is the one who, and so he didn't even mention. So again, we know that he's not blaming women in general, but the one interpretation of the first Corinthians 15 is, first Corinthians 15 is when he says it's the man. Yeah. The next part. Yeah. Yeah. It says that a woman will be saved through childbearing. That sounds confusing. Like, so I'm not saved until I have a baby or what if I can't have children? What does that mean? Right. And again, he's been talking about the effect of the curse that that because of that now, childbearing is going to be painful and things like that. But the word through doesn't always mean by like you're saved through something you're saved by it. It doesn't always mean that it can be to be brought through something to be brought safely through something. So again, using Paul's own words in first Corinthians three, when he's talking about what you build your life on and some men will be, will be, you know, their, their works are rewarded because they built their life on worthy things. Some men aren't. You're still saved, he says, but it's only as one escaping through the flames. Right. So he uses the word through there to talk about you're delivered through something to rescue through something, not by those things. And so in the same way, what one commentator was saying is the interpretation there is that women will be saved through that curse, through that consequence, they're saved out of it because of Jesus, not you're saved by having babies. Yeah. Yep. If that helps, just think that that's an that can be really confusing one if you stick with it means buy something. So this is this is I think like we talked about with the Genesis passages, or the Deuteronomy passages, it's great to remember, yes, you can interpret some of these through the worst possible light and try to make them say the worst possible things. And, but it's not one, it's not necessary. And two, it's a there's a very good possibility that those worst understandings, listen, Paul just thinks women are inferior. And therefore, God does because he inspired Paul with those thoughts. That's that's, it's not necessary to believe that's what's going on here. It's not even particularly likely that that's the intention of what's going on here. I don't, I don't think it's the best way to understand these passages. Obviously, I don't. But if you're out there, and it's causing you to these passages are causing you to struggle to recognize, you know, you don't have to see these, you can faithfully, rightfully biblically in a biblically sound way, understand these as not some type of minimization of women in church in creation in any of that kind of stuff. So we'll probably need to kind of our next one, we'll probably need to start a little bit and kind of wrap up a little bit. Especially about like, you know, maybe women in leadership or something in the church and how we discuss that stuff just a tiny bit. But then we can move into some of the other social issues that yes. And and that was another thing that I obviously we didn't get to get to today. But something that you mentioned, kind of in passing that the Jewish world saw baby as a blessing for the community and for the family, and what we can learn from the Jewish tendency to surround a family, who's in trouble, take care of them. I think as we continue to see abortion to be an, you know, a hot topic, even with sexism and with other things in our culture, I think it's good for us to also take a look back at those things. So you mentioned that offhand, I want to keep that in the hopper as well for something we can talk about. But yes, thank you guys for listening and bearing with us in our technical difficulties. We are really, really grateful for you.
