We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime today, Chris Sheridan and Chris Legge. Today we're talking about something that I don't enjoy talking about, but I think it's worth talking about because these types of things that we're going to discuss on a podcast today can cause deconstruction and people to think pretty critically. And this revolves around the idea of church leaders falling or making decisions that disqualify them from ministry. And so this is kind of, there's a guy in Texas named Aaron Ivey. He was a worship pastor. And so I'll just read kind of the lead line and then we can talk more about this. But it was just saying on Monday, February 5th, Aaron Ivey was fired from staff after it came to light that he engaged in inappropriate and explicit ongoing text messages with an adult male. So it's always, I mean, it's heavy to hear about that because he, I mean, I think he's been an elder and a pastor for years in Austin, Texas. And we were talking before he recorded, you know, as a worship leader. Yeah. So anyway, I know Chris Legge, you were saying, you know, it might be worth us talking about this. Why do you think it's worth us spending a little bit of time talking about something like this? Well, I think there's a lot of different ways or at least several different ways that this could feed into people deconstructing in their own faith. And I even, you know, wonder, you know, I haven't heard, he has not, I don't think put out any type of statement or comment personally, but even is this, does this in any way represent him deconstructing his faith or or something like that? And if that's the case, when that, when and if that comes out, maybe we can talk about that or discuss that. But, but you're dealing with certainly, you know, one, you have had now a leader, essentially what we would say is, you know, two different headings. Again, this is the kind of my brain is going all over the place. But one is, uh, is he, you know, the church has decided he's been doing something morally wrong. I think there might be some debate and this might even go back to our, you know, is the Bible, whatever is the Bible, what did we end up using sinful or whatever is the Bible immoral by today's standards. Yeah. Um, and so that's one that I would say that's a, that's an issue for sure is, you know, what was, did the Bible push him, did church push him into pretending to not be something that he was, um, that, that in the end it turns out, you know, he was gay and he should have just lived that life. And that this is what I would expect a secular message to be. He should have just lived out that life. And only because of the, you know, the failings of the church being bigoted or, uh, homophobic or something like that is why that's the case. I, I don't love that argument for a couple of reasons. One, he's, he's an adult human being who made his own decisions. And I think that's patronized patronizing to, you know, to say, you know, he was, he was just fooled or whatever, but, but, but I still can hear, I can still understand why that case gets made. Um, I think, I think there's an issue of, you know, he's a leader and he's been living out what apparently sounds like a hypocritical existence, claiming one thing and doing another. And apparently this has been ongoing for over a decade, right? Um, that he's been confronted on it and has, you know, allegedly worked on it and made promises. And so you, you definitely have that side of it regardless, even if, even if someone was to say, you know, that they didn't have a moral problem with him engaging in sexual conversations with people or whatever it was. Um, he still was married and that's still unfaithful. Right. And it is also wrong to promise your employer that you're going to change your behavior in some way and then not, not do something and then hide it instead. And again, I don't know his story. Maybe he's just fighting this tooth and nail and fell into it. In which case, you know, welcome to all the rest of us. That's, I can have a whole lot of sympathy for that kind of thing. And I think we all should. Um, I'm uncomfortable with that. It sounds like he was making claiming that he has, was not having issues with it and that it even included maybe some minors and some stuff like that. And anyway, I, so I think there's more to this than just, you know, whatever. I think there's some clearly some exploitation going on here, some power structure, dynamic issues. Um, but man, what have you been following and, and this person has inspired you or led you or, or whatever. What does that mean about your faith when the human who helped speak into your faith turns out to be, I mean, a human at least, at least, yeah, at least a human in the fallen sense and maybe a con. I mean, what if it turns out he's just a flat con artist? So anyway, I think all of these speak into it. All of them do. So I'd love to hear some thoughts there too. Yeah. Chris, what do you, what do you think when, cause I mean, this is not a new thing. Unfortunately, you know, this, this continues to happen, especially in our culture. Yeah. Well, I think that's, that's the sad part is like we, we have plenty of examples unfortunately, cause I think we had this like a year ago or something. We talked about Ravi Zacharias and stuff, um, or maybe longer. I don't know. But so the, the big thing that, that what we've talked about on here before many times is the deconstructing our faith in people, that we're not, we're not perfect and we're not going to be perfect. And I think when, when people think of when we sin, we're being hypocrites. That's, I'd have to define what, what do you mean by hypocrite? Cause hypocrite means play acting. But I think always saying that I am always, you know, going to be a struggling, you know, on my way still, you know, so I, I think of it as people are allowing their view of a perfect savior to be, pardon. Hold on one. No, no, no. Here say that, say that people are allowing it just, the, it just like briefly cut out. Okay. I think people are allowing their view of our perfect savior to be dictated by the imperfect people that he came to save. Um, if that makes sense. Exactly. In other words, this is exactly why we need a savior. I mean, he, I, I give empirical evidence every day that I need a savior. Um, just hopefully not as drastic as something like this, but, um, man, from a sin perspective, it's equivalent, right? Right. When people say, yeah, right, right, right. When people think that Christian sinning contradicts the gospel, it's actually no work confirming the gospel. Um, this is exactly why we need a savior. Um, right. But I mean, I understand that people being, you know, frustrated or saddened or feeling, um, you know, cheated or fake, you know, this was always this all fake anyways. Um, do we have to throw out every song that he wrote? And now there's no truth in any of the songs, you know, kind of a thing. And I think that's, that's also where we don't need to go that far. I heard, we might've talked about this when we were talking about this before, but, um, the idea that Judas was a part of the disciples being sent out with the 70 and a lot of stuff happened. And were there people that came to faith in Jesus because of Judas's testimony or words that he said or something like that? I think that's very likely. I mean, it sounds like a lot of amazing stuff happened. Um, and it's the same thing where Jesus was asked people were like, you know, people were doing things in your name and he's like, no, don't, don't stop them. Just cause they didn't know who they were. Or, um, you hear stories of people coming to faith after watching some big, you know, prosperity gospel preacher, even like the, somehow they heard the gospel. So it doesn't mean that everything they said was there for a lie. It means that the messenger is imperfect. Um, and it's a whole other issue of like, how do we deal with personal sin and, um, accountability and, you know, things like that. And what do we do when people do mess up and, um, things like that. But I just think it doesn't disqualify Christianity. Right. And I, and I love that, you know, that's something that we'll probably continue to hit on is that what we've talked about in the beginning, deconstructing your faith in humanity, like you were saying, right of if, if you find that this is a check in yourself of like, Oh my goodness. You know, I mean, cause I, cause I think there's a level of, you know, it, it, it is shocking and saddening to hear of somebody, uh, struggling in that way. Um, and then obviously, you know, what the implications are for that body of believers and what the implications are for their family. You know, I think there's, there's those, but then there's also, yeah, it's like, w if it's, if this is causing you to feel like, okay, dude, should I believe in God anymore? I feel like that's a good indication. Like maybe you need to check where, yeah, what God are you believing in and how are you elevating a man or a person or human being to the place where we should only be believing in Christ in the Messiah who, who can fulfill that, who can, who can actually, um, we can actually put our faith in. Yes. I was thinking this is kind of a silly example, but well, for one thing, I'll also reminding us that Aaron Ivy's life is an over his journey is still ongoing. Totally. Yeah. We're right now reading a headline. And so my thought was you could have written a headline in the middle of, you know, man after God's own heart caught in scandal of, you know, another man's wife with David or well, you know, well respected prophet, angry enough to die that God won't judge people or, you know, Jonah or, or Peter like, you know, prominent disciple denies it even new G it's like, we are all, we should have this big sign up over our heads. It says work in progress. Cause we're all a work in progress. And, um, at any given point, you know, I'm just, I'm still on this side of heaven. What makes me, what makes me sad for a situation like this. And again, I don't know the details. So please, you know, as more details come out, some of this may be wrong, but, um, but man, what makes me so sad with this story as, as with Robbie's story is that it seems like he was just hiding it or, or denying it or making all kinds of promises. And I just, I just, it breaks my heart that he didn't, I mean, again, I know, I don't know this. Maybe there's going to be 20, maybe there's 20 people at that church or like, no, we were praying with him. We were talking with him. We were working with him. This was just his struggle. This is where he struggled. This was his temptation. This was his addiction. This was his whatever. And man, we were walking with him the whole time. Then I, if I hear that, I, my, my attitude on this will change a lot. It sounds like from what got reported that, that he has been called on this, he's been offered help and he has chosen to not do what he needed to do to deal with this issue. And instead just continued to try to hide it now for, you know, over a decade. It looked like from the, from the articles that the first conversation about this happened like in 2011. But it's, it's hard to know whether they're saying, no, we've gone back and discovered it that the 2011, or if it was, you know, whatever. And, you know, I also, I also, you know, it really, it really is sad that it's, you know, I know there's not a difference probably in the kingdom ledger for some of this, but, but man, it just, it does certainly feel like a difference when you're talking about, I blew it, I messed up. And I've been manipulating minors into sexual conduct because I, you know, I feel like somewhere in there, there probably is a line to say, I, there were plenty of opportunities to avoid this step along the way. And I chose not to do it. So again, I'm not, I'm not drawing some theological distinction there, more of a behavioral and even consequential distinction. And, and I do think it's appropriate for the church to say, hey, based on what we've discovered, you know, we're, we're coming alongside him. We want to love him. And we have reported his behavior to the proper authorities. And we have, you know, released him from his contract here at the church. Again, all of those things are true, can be true simultaneously. And it doesn't mean we hate him. Like we love him. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And I suspect there will be plenty of people, and it doesn't mean this is one of those tough ones. People really wrestle with this. I know they do when someone deconstructs or whatever, or in this case kind of falls in their faith. It's, it's the same thing. Like, dude, does that mean I need to not sing their music? Does that mean I need to not, you know, listen to their stuff or, or sing their stuff or listen to their, and, and I for one believe that that is not a necessary consequence. I get it. I certainly get it. At the same time, I'm like, man, I, I would hate for someone to say, because of sin in someone's life, we can no longer listen to them proclaim truth because the early, the early church thought about that and came to the conclusion that the message is what is important about the Christian faith, not the messenger outside of Jesus, that our faith, like you were saying, our faith is never in the messenger. It is in the message. But man, is that easier said than done for us as humans. Right. I think when I heard for the first time years ago that Jonathan Edwards owned slaves, right? That really bothered me. Like, Oh man, really? Or that Martin Luther King Jr. had an affair. Like those things. Like I just go, ah, that really, it doesn't, it doesn't, like you said, take away what they said, but it complicates it as far as like, this would be so much easier and believable if you weren't, you know, also, or like the founding fathers owning slaves. Right. And that doesn't take away the truth that. Toil, concubines. Yeah. Yeah. The other one I think I read, oh, it was a Martin Luther had a lot of anti-Semitic views. Yes. Yep. So anyways, but that doesn't change what they said, what they said can still be true. Right. I think my response to when all of this, when anything like this happens as a, as a man, as a Christian, as a husband, as a dad is to, to always let it put a little more fear of God in me. I'm like, man, Lord, I, it doesn't, it makes me more scared. Like, Oh my goodness. I remember when I was confronting a dad at family camp who was planning on leaving his family to pursue this woman and how just the mess it was going to make of his family. I was obviously upset by it and angered by kind of his obstinate attitude, but I went home and I think a couple of my sons were at home and I just gathered them up. I said, you guys, can we just pray? I've just, this really just scared me that this guy who knows all of this truth can still be doing this stubbornly. And I don't want to ever get to that point where I could do that. Cause I just want to be scared that I could fall too, but by the grace of God, um, for any of us. Right. Yeah. Right. That's, that's I, I, yeah, I, I know how flawed I am. Right. Um, I know how sinful I can be. And yet I teach on Sunday mornings, preach from the Bible on Sunday mornings, and I'm counting on God's word and his spirit to be what speaks to people. Um, cause even if other people don't know what I wrestle with or struggle with, although I'm not very secretive about it, but you know, I don't, you know, if someone saw me scarfing that third or fourth, uh, by the way, did you know, you'll know that them, they now make zebra cake rolls. Sorry, I shouldn't have told you then not just zebra cake cakes now, but they make rolls speaking, speaking of scarfing three, three of something at a sitting. And so I could imagine somebody seeing me scarf down that third one and go like, I don't know if I should listen to him talk about self-control like him teaching about what the Bible says about self-control. I don't know that he's the expert. I'm not, uh, Bible, however, is God's word speaks about those things expertly and into our lives. I just, I'm not always the best at following them either. And so we even talked, I even talked about how on Sunday, the issue of prayer, like it's not surprising to me that our churches, you know, kind of in one of the places where we struggle sometimes is in regards to prayer corporately, because that's not one of my strong suits in the faith. And I need to be led in that. And so, you know, we got to continue to work on those things. I'm, I'm, anyway, I'm just, that's my concern. I don't want people to fall away because Christians fall away. And, and again, I don't know if he's struggling and that's the only issue here and he's fallen. Okay. Well, we can love him through that. Or if he's been a con artist, using his position at the church as an opportunity to hurt people, which means he's a sinner and I can love him and would like for that to change for him. Um, either way, um, I, I agree. I want to encourage people to turn to Christ, um, when our heroes fall, not, not, not to just other heroes. Anyway, if I can add to two related, uh, John Piper quotes, because I think they're both so good. One of them was sparked in my mind. Chris, when you mentioned prayer, he says, if prayer doesn't come easily for you, consider yourself normally fallen and sinful, like the rest of us, and then fight. Um, like that's just it. And then another one that he said is being born again, doesn't mean that you have no bad desires. It means that you're at war with them. That's exactly. Just to be reminded, like, of course I have these desires. Of course, it's going to be a battle on this side of heaven. But if I could do a plug for this again, and I did this last time we talked for both of our churches, the region program, the regeneration program is specifically there to help you learn how to bring your sin to the light and be accountable and find your identity in Christ. And it's not just for major addictions that we think of it. Literally is for everyone that we all need to be confessing our sin and keeping it in the light there. And so both of those programs are available at South spring and at watermark and they're just so helpful. They absolutely are. Yeah. And then last thing I was going to say is Chris, uh, shared the, I was thinking about this driving into work today and I, and I, I feel like every time this happens or this type of thing comes to light, what, what you have said for years is a secret life of sin or sorry, a secret life of prayer will protect you from a secret life of sin. And so I feel like, vice versa. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And so that, that was even more just like convicting to me of like, okay, the Lord can use this even to, yeah, even to convict me and, and like spark that fear of like, okay, remembering who I am, that I am just a human and that I need him all the more. Yep. So true. Very cool. Well, thank you guys for the time. That's, you know, if you don't mind, I'd love to pray for real quickly. Let's say a quick prayer for Aaron and, and for his family, I know his, I think his wife is also pretty well known in the community, Jamie, Ivy, and for Austin stone. So if we could, let's, let's pray for them. And, and, uh, and then we can be done with this, but man, just encourage people don't, don't lose heart because humans, it turns out need a savior. Father, we're so grateful for this time. Thanks for Chris being available to hang out today. Pre-continued bless all that he's doing over there at watermark and Lord, as these churches, um, man, these churches, uh, grow and have further influence. There's going to be issues like this that happen because we are failed and flawed humans. And that's not an excuse. We're not saying, um, so we're not going to have to try or, you know, when we blow it, don't hold us accountable. We warned you, we were messed up. That's, that's not what we're talking about. We're, Lord, I pray that you would hold us fast, that you would help us to be faithful, that we would stick and stand. Um, as we talked about this weekend at our D now, Lord, that we would be standing and that when the battle has, has raged and there are corpses laying all around, we're still standing. Um, in all regards to the faith you've called us to, um, I want to lift up in particular, um, Aaron and his wife, Jamie, and I don't know if they've got kids. I think they probably do. And I, I pray your faithfulness that you would speak comfort into them somehow, Lord, that what would happen is what would need to happen, that justice would be done and mercy would be lived out and grace would be poured onto all, um, in a way that, Lord, I know that they just cannot imagine the way their lives have changed now. And so, um, Lord, I, I know the churches are going to mess up stuff like this and humans are and pastors are and so many are. And so I'll, I, Lord, I pray for your faithfulness as we unpack all of this in our own lives. When we see those who we love and appreciate, when we see them fall or when we see them fail, or sometimes when they turn out not to be at all who or whether we thought they were, Lord, I pray that our eyes would be come back to you, not to the storms, um, or even to the water that we're walking on Lord, but on always back to you. And so we trust in you, the author and finisher of our faith and is in the name of your perfect son that we pray. Amen. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
