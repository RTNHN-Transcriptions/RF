We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. Alongside me today are Chris Legg and Chris Sherrod. Today we are talking about weariness and tiredness when it comes to your faith. Are you yawning over there, Chris Legg? You yawned all through that last episode. I did not. Hey, everybody go back and listen to the theories of truth and see if you can hear Colson yawning. You didn't make me tired. You guys didn't make me tired. I wasn't taking any responsibility. Okay, good. I just wanted to make that clear. That was a little pot calling the kettle black. Sorry, that was the... No, you're totally fine. Weariness and tiredness. Wait, speaking of, why are we talking about this? All right, so man, it came up in one of our last conversations, this idea that people are kind of worn out. What were you, Chris, you were saying something about that. What do you think about that? For some of the people that you're hearing are deconstructing their faith more, what we would call celebrity Christians, like I was talking about Kevin Mac Smith of DC Talk fame. I was just asking what were his reasons. Colson and I have a gal that we know who wrote a book on her faith being deconstructed. It was mainly, I felt like her being immersed in an environment that was very much the opposite of what she'd been raised. But I just wonder, I guess my thought was how many Christians their deconstruction is either them just feeling overwhelmed like the pressure is so hard to always all the time take a stand or resist compromise. Kind of being on the defensive. Yeah, and is it just because we're getting tired? It's just like, oh, it's easier just to give in and to go with it and just in my mind just go, but I know in my heart, I believe that I believe something different. Or is it, I don't know. That's just what I was talking about because it is tiring, especially to feel like you're going uphill all the time. Or I don't want to be the martyr or like we're not always under attack. But yeah, no, certainly not. But it is something where I feel more and more like the basic assumptions that we all held were like, wait, wait, we're jettisoning that one now too. Like we don't believe that anymore. Right. So I just wonder how many people just either are fearful or just the price tag is too high. I was just thrown at her. What are the options? Yeah. And I think that's maybe it's not something that at least I fully realize in my community because of where I live. But there are probably people even within our country who are experiencing lack of social capital or whatever, or just like being kicked out of friend groups. And that can be, that can just be taxing and tiring too of like, I feel lonely. I feel disconnected. And I think that can make people tired too. And just resisting sin in your own life. True that. True that. You're trying to stand for these values, but at the same time you're like, but I struggle too. Like I'm, I'm pressured to give in. And I think that's what's happened to a lot of young people that I know. I just feel like they, they're, they're just tired of having to, I don't know, always fight it or I don't know. So yeah, there's a, when we talked about, and we talked about a few weeks ago, our definitions of faith and how mine is psychologically rooted. And we talked about even afterwards, how probably our definitions actually aren't really different. As far as, you know, me describing what the psychological state of faith or belief or conviction or whatever, being convinced of something. But, but if it's especially, if it is a psychological state to the degree that that's our role in it, it, you can get tired of that. I mean, you get exhausted of having to defend something or stand by something or I think weariness. When I do marriage counseling, I will, I run into the difference between someone who's angry or hurt or betrayed. And I always feel like, okay, we can, we can make headway with this. But if what they seem to be feeling is weariness, I get very worried very quickly. If someone's just, they're just tired of fighting. It's just, I mean, is that what your definition of weariness is? It's just like spent or spent. I'm just done. I'm just done. I just don't, I don't have anything left to invest in weariness often comes just from being hassled. And so very often when we're weary, we either felt like we need to lash out or we feel like we need to lash out to protect ourselves. But as Christians, we're not supposed to lash out. And so it's like, this person is telling me I'm not loving them because I don't agree with them on something. And I'm tired of trying to defend that I love them in a definition they just are unwilling to accept. It kind of reminds me of if you if you ever listened to William Lane Craig's defenders podcast or reasonable faith podcast, both excellent podcasts. And, and they keep coming back to these the atheist arguments that they have in conversations with people about the question, why is there something rather than nothing? And every time they do, the other person comes out and says, well, I mean, when you're talking about nothing, after talking about our tiny particles and energy sources get gathering around the universe, and you can just see Dr. Craig putting his head in his hands every time like, well, that, then that that would not be nothing. I mean, that would be something. Now, why is there? Why is there something rather than nothing? This is a philosophical question. It's a thought experiment. Why is there something rather than not seems like statistically speaking, what there should be is nothing. Where did something come from? Why does it exist? Why would it like, and I'm telling you, time after time, people will say, well, depends kind of how you define nothing. And you just you can hear him now even on the podcast slapping his forehead going, what do you mean how you define nothing? Like if I say I'm walking down the hall, how many people did you see? No one. So how many people did I see? Well, one exactly. Well, a little one. Did you see a little person? Like, I saw no one, it is a complete negation to hear the poor man try to define this is is even humorous. Like, um, yeah, I mean, I mean, there's no things, no, no things, not not anything. So, so will these these, you know, pre existent light like, Nope, no, see, that would be something. And I get that you eventually just got weary. Okay, listen, I give, I'm just not gonna talk with you about it anymore. Fine, you win. Now, Dr. Craig will never, never, never do that on this topic. But, but that's I think people are experiencing that emotion. It's costing me and we talked about social capital, it's costing me capital, it's costing me literal money, it's costing me, you know, a friend who published a paper at a seminary and got a failing grade on it. Because in his very honest, I read it very honest, very appropriate explanation of a Hebrew word. It's applied in the Old Testament homosexuality. And so as Professor said, your paper is unnecessarily bigoted. So F and it's all he did was a word study and there's nothing, I mean, there's absolutely nothing biblically unsound about his argument. If, if the professor was to say, well, I really think the Bible is bigoted. Fine. I mean, don't fail him. That's not his fault. He's so it. And so I feel like this kind of stuff is happening. And at what point do you go, do people say, Oh my gosh, I'm just tired of talking about, I'm tired of hearing about it. I'm tired of, so I give up. And I think a lot of Christians are dealing with that because they're hearing about it at every turn. You turn on the turn on something. And I don't, you know, issues of transgender issues are not one of my main areas of focus. It's not one of my main concerns in regards to stuff. I don't know where I stand on some of those issues morally or from an application perspective. Um, uh, that's a whole different complex conversation for a therapist, especially, but I mean, this morning my kids watching a cartoon and, uh, and it's, it's a group of, you know, little animated little baby figures and they're going to have a Cinderella party. And so they're going to have a, a, a ball. And the, one of the little boys is all bummed because all the little girls are going to wear dresses and all the boys are going to wear suits. And this one little boy wants to wear a dress. So they, that his very, his fairy godmother father, I don't know if you can fairy god, whatever makes him a dress and then hides him. And at the end of the cartoon, they realize we should throw away that rule book. There should be no rule book about what people wear when they, and I'm like, Oh my gosh. I mean, it, it, no matter how I feel about it, I'm just like, what do I do with this again? How do I talk about this again? It's, it's just a constant messaging that gets, I think people get weary about. Yeah. But again, I think what, what can encourage you is if you do reconstruct your faith or if we are helpful in that, yeah, giving you tools to respond or to think even to talk yourself back into things. Yes. Right. Okay. So why do I believe there is a God or what, why, why did I disagree with that? Or what is my basis of truth or whatever it is that can be encouraging. And I think it's amazing the number of people who actually don't think very deeply, right? Right. Like you ask, what's the best, what do you think is the best explanation for the universe coming into existence from nothing? Right. And there's like, ah, I mean, I don't know. It could, or is it really that important? Like, no, it's really important. Like how do you answer it? But they just don't see it. Cause I think we're so caught up in, um, I just want to live my life or I just want to be happy or I just want, and it's that radical autonomy that I just want. It's like we said before that I feel like in the eighties and nineties, people really dealt with, I want to know evidence for God, Jesus, the Bible creation. And now it's the kind of God I don't like, or I don't like the Bible isn't agreeing with what I want or it might be, but it's, it's like we're, we're, we're not seeing that the, um, what am I thinking of? The, uh, you believe you're two different people or you go back and forth and multiple personality or bipolar or yeah, multiple personality. What's it just called though? Dissociative identity disorder. There's a simpler word dichotomy. No, that's even too complex. Anyways that people want to live as if there's purpose, as if there's meaning as if, uh, I have, you know, something that there's a reason to live, but then at the same time I want to reject the basis of there being a meaning. And I want to say that everyone decides from themselves, but you have to agree with me. It's like, everything is just so, they're just not thinking clearly and it just gets muddled. Um, in, uh, and they're thinking, I just, I don't know. I just feel like people aren't, I don't know. They're just not thinking. They don't want to think because it leads to bigger questions that they might have to then be accountable or they might have to. Yeah. I don't want to get overly spiritual so, so quickly in all this, cause I'm sure at some point we'll talk about the invisible creation, but, um, CS Lewis's book, Screwtape Letters revealed a lot of these for me, a lot of these internal processes that I had that I didn't realize I was having. And he, you know, he puts them in the mouth of a demon, Screwtape and he re- well, you thought of the word? Schizophrenic. That's so hard. Sorry. It just came to my brain all of a sudden. Sorry. That's the therapist in me. So schizophrenia is not technically sorry. It's just what came to my head. Like where you're, you're, you're back and forth. You're right. We'll wait till the schizophrenia episode. That's exactly where we get to the schizophrenia. So in Screwtape Letters, he, he talks, there's a great, I think it may be letter one or letter two in it, but the, the older demon Screwtape references that, that there's like an old college professor or something who's sitting outside of the garden and he's looking and he's, you know, Screwtape says, I noticed that his thoughts were starting to run in a strange direction. Now keep in mind, CS Lewis is not trying to write a theology book in Screwtape Letters. It's fiction. It's way more, it's, it's way more psychology than it is religion in a lot of places. And this is one of them I think, but he says, he says, so I see his thoughts kind of running in an unsafe direction and he's starting to ask the big questions and he says, you know, Screwtape is like the big questions are always on God's side. They're never on our side. Anytime somebody's even thinking about what's the purpose of life and why am I here and what's the nature of truth? He's like Screwtape says those never serve us being a demon. He says they always serve the enemy. And so he said, I could have tried to jump in and argue with him, but as a demon, I never want to argue with him because argument always works towards God's perspective. And I even wonder if that's why they moved away from the, I need evidence because then they got it and it's like, Oh, well then I don't need evidence. I don't want evidence. I don't need. He said, so the demon says that the man was thinking, man, these are such important questions, such important questions. He said, rather than argue with him, what I put, the thought I put in his head was yes, much too important to think about on an empty stomach. And so, so brilliant. So he thought that's a good point. I need to, you know, yeah, much too important to have on an empty stomach. I need to go get lunch and then I'll come back and ponder these things. And while at lunch, he notices the absurdity of the woman sitting next to him here and the reality of the, by the time he came back, he wasn't thinking about that anymore. And, and I think that's it. I think, I think there is a, you remember, um, isn't it brave new world that there's constant noise and constant sound? Is that brave new world out of sexually? There's always piped in, piped in music and piped in sound and piped in news. There's always so much. And the guy says, uh, the guy says, how do you, how do you ever think about God? And, and cause if you don't ever think about if you, as I see, if you can't stop and think in silence, you probably never think about death. And if you don't ever think about death, how do you think about God? And it's like, there's this, there's this line of thinking of, man, if we're just a distracted all the time and we never stop and think, we never stop and ponder, we're just onto the new thing. And that does seem to certainly be true of our culture. I don't, I don't, again, I'm not saying I'm trying to place that on some kind of demonic power, but it certainly works against us that we're always jumping and jumping. We skip across the top, like a rock on water rather than diving deep. And well, we literally have so many things that can distract us. Anybody like trying to get to my, um, it's like, I'm going to look something up on YouTube related to like a talk or something. And by the time I'm there, I watched all these things, I'm like, why was I even here? But even like, you know, open up my phone in the morning to go to this Devo thing that I clicked. There's, there's, let me just see if anybody posted on our family group, me or if anyone, and I'm immediately not with bad things, but there's so many more things out there. Like we're going through, like I said before, Ecclesiastes with the young professionals and, um, there's just so many things that you can try. Yes. And then it didn't work. I'll try this. And it's like, there's nothing new into the sun, but there's so many other options or ways that to end up with his same conclusion of that was meaningless or a breath or a vapor is going to take you a whole lot longer. I feel like because you really can just get busy. And yeah, very true. Well, I guess my, my question then is if any of our listeners are feeling weary or tired or know someone who is feeling weary and tired in their faith because of X, Y, or Z, what would be your encouragement for them or here practically? I mean, man, from pure practicality, I would give a couple of things. One is, um, find a way to get together with some like-minded people and enjoy that time. Have some fun with some people who are staying, are part of your Christian community. And I mean that purely practical. It's just as humans, we're also pack animals and we, we are so refreshed by one another. And when we get to discuss these things among other believers and that's certainly now I'm a, I'm a very relational person. And so that's a big one for me that I have, uh, you know, as crazy as it sounds, it's like something to something that helps feed my faith is a monthly poker night with guys. Like that doesn't sound like the kind of thing you would think some people go, that's, that's what feeds your faith. Like it's, it's one of them. It is just a great relieving, what our good friend, John Redfern calls me meaningless time with meaningful people. And that is a great encouragement. And I think that's very biblical by the way, that we're, one of the main places we find encouragement is from one another. Um, and related to that too, if you're not surrounding yourself with truth, in other words, if you, if I only read articles about the dangers of driving a car and all I did all day long is see videos of car accidents and I listened in on the police, you know, whatever. And, and I just, I only started myself with people who had been in terrible accidents. I of course would be afraid of driving. And I would think it's terrible because that's all I'm surrounded myself with. And it's the same thing if people, if you're surrounding yourself with this view of, um, sex or marriage or what gives you meaning. Like if, if you're only surrounded and that this goes back to even our conversation on truth, Paul said in singing Timothy four, that the time will come and people won't put up with sound doctrine, healthy doctrine instead to suit their own desires. They will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. And so it's what I want to hear. I'm just surrounded myself with that. And so even this girl that we've talked about that, that walked away from her deconstructor of faith, I just wonder what was that environment that you were in feeding your faith or was it always, always, always questioning your faith. And if you weren't strong enough, if it was a straw man, faith that we've been talking about, right? Of course it collapsed, but what collapsed was your, your false view of what Christianity is. And I think related to this too, even going back to this gal in her, um, there's so much related to what we've talked about. What she talked about there is that really resonated with me when somebody would say something like that was her standard, like, that made it really deep, deep down inside that resonated. So is that your standard of truth? But also, um, I just wonder, have you experienced a real relationship with the creator of the universe that gives you purpose and hope and meaning and, and deliverance and salvation from my sins and, um, you know, this hope that goes beyond that, that I'm like, I want you to have that too, rather than, but are you happy right now in your little lifestyle? And I think that's where I just go, but what do you think you have? Cause in it, she was saying like, I was the one who was blind. I was the one who was dead. I was the one who needed their eyes open. And it was like, that, that means you didn't, I don't think you really knew. I would never describe that as my relationship with the creator of the universe as dead, you know, blind, whatever. It's like, I have something that's amazing. And because I love you, I don't want you to just settle for this stuff. I want you to experience even more, know this hope or this purpose that goes beyond the little stuff that you're falling for. So part of it just goes back to being excited about something energizes you and gives you perseverance. You know what I mean? Like, I think it's, it makes you want to go on. Cause you're like, I really am excited about this. Whereas if it's not that exciting, it's like, what's, what's the point? I heard this from someone else on another podcast talking about pilgrims progress. And it's interesting. So every, and what you have to remember is pilgrims progress. The whole thing is this big allegory. So everything that he wrote stands for something that symbolizes something. So this guy pointed out that along the journey that Christian makes, and I forget exactly whose companion was at this point, they met atheist. So what I love it is when it helps you know exactly who this person is, their name is atheist worldly wise men. But yeah, atheist actually didn't cause their faith to waver at all. Like it wasn't, they weren't like, Oh my goodness, let me stop and listen to everything you have to say. And now I'm not sure. Right. What, what got them into trouble was at some point along the journey, they, the road was seeming to wind really long. And, and I think it was actually Christian said, I, I think this is a shortcut. Let's cut through this field. So they, they climbed a fence and they were cutting through a field and it led to, I think there's a storm and they had to take shelter and they fell asleep. But what they had done is they had wandered onto the land of the property owned by the giant named despair. Yep. And despair took them captive and despair then took them and imprisoned them in doubting castle. Yeah. And it's while they were there that all of these things come out, like all of these woes and like, we should just die now. Cause he gives them the option. Like you guys, if you want to just finish yourself off, you can. And they're going through all of these was, was this whole journey in vain, you know, all of these things. So the interesting thing is what is we're talking about people giving up or people wanting to just not keep trying. It really is true that life, and again, this is what the Bible promises that you will have trouble in this world and we are in need of perseverance and it uses that word, run the race with endurance and you need steadfastness. And there's a reason for that. And what gets us a lot of times is not outright atheism. Cause like, no, no, no, I don't, I know that there's a God, but it's, I just despair right now. That was a rough day or a year or years. Yeah. And I want to give in. And so then you get caught up in doubting castle where you're like, is this even worth it? And of course, Satan loves despair. And yes. Cause remember what we've talked about is doubt itself is not the enemy. No, it's great. Being feeling hopeless in the midst of it is what gets, is what gets so tough. Yeah. Feeling hopeless in the midst of it. And weariness is, I think is connected to that when people feel the despair and the weariness. And actually I would say the other one, the other thing practically that helps me is, is getting time away from distractions. And, and that may not be the best thing for someone who's in the midst of depression that they, they need to be around people first. But when I, when I get off by myself, just me and God, and we're just sitting and hanging out and doing whatever, sipping coffee or whatever, I just sitting and listening is to him and hearing what just, just listening and talking about what's on my heart. Those are the things that really build a sense for me of confidence as well. That builds back into me a sense of strength. I also don't think, so I will tell you, I don't, I don't think it's wrong to ask God to help you in a time like that. I don't, I don't think that's like putting God to some kind of weird test to say, you know, God, I'm pretty worn out here. If you could send something or someone, dude, you know what I need to encourage me. Could you send me that, send that my way? And that may be, who knows what that is. Only God knows what that is. And God knows you best. But that's what so many of the Psalms are about. They're so great where he's not afraid to say why, where are you, and in most of the Psalms that are like that, it's a very honest raw, almost make you uncomfortable raw. Like, oh my goodness, David's asking, he's, you know, claiming this isn't fair. And so there's an honest expression of feelings. But what I like is for the most part, all of the Psalms land back on truth somewhere. Like, but this is what I know. Like I've gotten done expressing how I feel, but then they're going to land on, but here's what I know either about God or I'm thinking back to what God has done. And it's like they're reminding themselves. And I would even say, you see Jesus doing what you just said, Chris, of solitude. And I heard a guy explain one time the difference between isolation versus solitude. And he said, isolation is putting yourself in a box where solitude is putting your distractions in a box. I thought that was helpful, at least to think like, I'm not going to be distracted. I'm not just going to put myself in a box and have no other outside, but I'm going to purposely get rid of the things that are distracting me. And that's right. Even with Jesus' ministry, he would tell his disciples like, let's, we need to get away and like, come away with me to a desolate place. And then his ministry flowed out of his time of solitude. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. I would say those are the kind of things that help you, help encourage you. Remember that um, uh, religious things aren't, aren't the only things that come from God. So what encourages you a good book, a great song, um, a beautiful sunset, a walk in the park, playing with your puppies, like those are all from God, all those things that lift us up are from God. And so, um, you know, being with your friends, loving your spouse, serving somebody, going and exercising and sweating hard, like those are, those are all good things. God has given those things to us. I think in the church world, sometimes we accidentally communicate. If, if you're not, if it's not a church done, you know, in the name of a church event, then it must not be from God. And all things are bad. If you're having fun, you're probably in the middle of sin is I think too often the idea that's taught instead of man, we have a God who loves us and wants us to have an abundant life and has an abundant life for us, even that may involve hardships and suffering. And so it's not a, that's not, that's not one thing. So listening to, for me, also another one is listening to a great, uh, either a great speech or a great sermon or a great comedian or great, great music or that kind of stuff. Those, the power of words to encourage me and uplift me is a huge one for me. So a great podcast. If you know any of any of those, yeah, sorry. No, comment. If you know a great podcast, please put the link. We'll listen to it. You mentioned being religious. I think that is part of the problem is that we think that, if we're being good Christians, we can't be depressed or sad or question things. So we got to put on this front, like we're, I'm good. I'm okay. I'm really okay. And the most helpful thing you can do is actually say, Hey, I'm struggling. Yep. Like to be honest with someone to say, I really need this or to, can we together talk about, and again, I love, I think that this church is one of the, you know, leaders in the area of like your, your, your wins in that life group of come ask questions. Yes. Please come and ask questions. Like, let's talk this through. Don't feel like you have to hide them or pretend that they're not there because they're there. So you can either address them or not address them, but let's talk about it right there with you. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructive faith.
