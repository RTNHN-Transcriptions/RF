We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner and I am not alongside Chris Legg in person. He is actually out at a camp out enjoying the outdoors. I would say, would you call this morning brisk where you are, Chris? Brisk is fair. Brisk is fair. It rained all day yesterday and it's in the 40s this morning. So yeah. Man. Brisk. But the sun has come up, which we didn't think was going to happen and that's going to be awesome. Well, Chris is out there camping, but he is willing to call in and have a conversation with me. And today's one I'm really excited about, not that I'm not excited about other ones, but because it tends to be a hot button topic for people. The concept of pastors falling or failing in their roles as pastors and kind of having moral failure. And so I would love to hear the thoughts because you brought this up of kind of why we see this trend and then along with our themes, what can or how can this, I guess not how, but what can we do that will allow us to not let this be an issue that causes us to deconstruct our faith? Yeah, this is an intriguing conversation and I'm sure, I mean, I actually don't know that I know anyone personally who has completely deconstructed their faith or completely walked away. Oh, like walking away from it completely. Okay. Gotcha. Because of a falling pastor, although I'm sure I'm just saying I'm sure that happens. I am sure there are plenty of people and listening to the, for example, the Rise and Fall of Mars Hill podcast, it sounded like there were several people under those settings that had fully deconstructed their faith after the fall of the lead pastor. So I would say I'm sure it happens for completely happens for people. I have known of several situations where people's faith has been challenged and really shaken because of the fall of a pastor. My own wife, her student minister fell morally not long after she left student minister being a student and it really shook her. And then years later, a gentleman who did actually performed, he was one of the two men who performed our wedding, Ginger Minds wedding, he fell, it turned out he had been having an affair the whole time he was doing all of that. And that also shook us. But in the end, it's kind of what we talked about on the podcast several times that what I've ended up doing is deconstructing my faith in humans, not deconstructing my faith in God. And I don't know if being a therapist helps me delineate that, but I know all humans are messed up and have issues and all that kind of stuff. And so just because someone's a pastor or lead pastor or seminary professor or youth minister, that doesn't somehow mean they don't have issues, addictions, problems, stuff like that. But it's been intriguing to see when it feels like it does feel like in the last few years. And I don't know if it's a true trend as in that it's getting worse or it's just better publicized like if it's more in the open when these lead pastors fall or and they seem to fall for kind of two main ways. And my experience is one is that they're jerks, they're narcissistic control freaks. And that eventually comes out as they burned the bridges with all their staff, with their leadership, with their elders, with their congregation, with whatever. And eventually it's just too much and people can't take it. And the whole church system sometimes is built on their personality. And then eventually that same driven, controlling, demanding, hard driving personality is also within, not that's what grows the church in the short run, but that's also what kills the church in the long run. And we've seen that. I think the root of that is that all of us have some narcissism and certainly anybody who's willing to step up in front of a whole group of people, hundreds of people or even thousands of people and tell them, you know, this is what we think God is saying, or this is what I think God is saying. I mean, that's, there's some minimum, some pretty high confidence there, if you know what I mean. Right. And so at worst, they kind of begin to buy their own press and to believe what people say about them and they begin to think it's about them and about their success and it becomes their church. We talked about the staff years ago, went to a conference and the lead pastor at the church that was hosting the conference got up and kind of introduced every single talk. He spent like 10 or 15 minutes introducing every single talk, not just the speaker, but every single talk. And as if he wanted to make sure that everyone knew the real story about this, you know, about what was being talked about before, whoever the guy they had hired or girl they'd hired to come in and talk. And we were all like, she kind of feels icky. This is awfully a lot about him. And then in his talk, he referenced, you know, the big beautiful building that we were all in and at some point told the story of, you know, meeting with the architect and the architect says, the architect says something about, well, you know, I'm building this big church. And this pastor said, no, no, you're just you're designing a building. I build the church. And there was a whole room full of pastors and there's this awkward, like, I don't know, 10 second break. And I think that's how long it took him to realize what he had said. There was an awkward silence for about 10 seconds or so. And then the pastor says, I mean, I mean, of course, Christ builds the church. No, no, I don't mean me build. I mean, Christ is the church. Interesting. But we all kind of made eye contact with the group who was there with me and I contacted were kind of like, I'm not confident that the first one is in what he meant. And I think I think that type of hard driving kind of can be self-absorbed. But you know, high control type of person, people like being led like that in the short term. I mean, it's it's exciting and you feel like you're a part of some grand movement that's going to and this guy is going to change the world. And he does everything and you know, everything he says is new and brilliant. And if people get caught up in that and they forget that he is he's just a mouthpiece. He's just in fact, I will tell you the four. I have four religious symbols in my right now they're in your office, actually, that are probably in the room somewhere where you are. That are my reminders of what my roles are as a pastor. And so there's a blade which references, you know, the power of God's word to be living an active and sharper than any two edged sword. And then there is a flame or in that case, an oil lamp. And that's referencing the prophecy about Jesus that a bruised reed he would not break and the smoldering wick he would not snuff out. And it may be surprising people might think, oh, I assume there's going to be something about being the light of the world or whatever. Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's part of our role as well. But as a lead pastor, it's let God's word be the blade that does that type of work. Let it be the scalpel. And then I want to follow my rabbi in being so gentle that even a reed that is bruised is handled so gently it won't break and the wick that is smoldering will not be snuffed out. And that's I think that fits well with this whole podcast is, yeah, that is somebody deconstructing their faith. I mean, they're like a bruised reed or a smoldering wick, especially those who have experienced church hurt, hurt in the name of Jesus through the church or whatever. And so that's that's a reminder to me. And then there's a cup, which is about, you know, the kind of the ordinances and responsibilities of the job as a pastor. And then there is a donkey. And the donkey is there to remind me that my job is to transport Jesus to the people. It's not about me. And it comes from the account in the Bible where where Jesus rides a donkey into Jerusalem and people are throwing down their coats and are cloaks and waving palm leaves and shouting Hosanna, Hosanna, blesses you comes the name of the Lord. And I heard a preacher many years ago, I don't remember who many years ago reference. You've got to imagine there were times that that donkey was thinking, man, these people really like me. And so it's important to remember, yeah, the donkey was not what people were waving their arms about. That's not who was important in that scene. And so so anytime I'm tempted to think, you know, as much as I appreciate people when they pay compliments or when they say kind things or when they offer encouragement, all that's fine and great. And everyone needs that. Everybody appreciates that. But even the reminder when someone says, you know, and I don't try to be the kind of weirdly false humility where I don't say thank you and try to, you know, oh, you know, it's not about me. But because I think God does use me and that's really cool that God uses me. But God also used a donkey to ride into Jerusalem. That doesn't write the honor does the honor and glory doesn't go to the donkey. Right. And the donkey did his job. Good job, donkey. Well done. And that'll do. That'll do. That'll do, donkey. Oh, so well, so in and I love those those symbols and that they have meaning and that that's kind of where your heart is kind of pressing in a little bit when you know, I know you talk a lot in your sermons to your congregation about and even on the podcast about not having our faith be in humanity. I know or the whole concept of have you met you? You know, you know your own shortcomings, you know, your own, you know, your own spots where you fall or have struggles. But how do you take this take extra steps to ensure that you're not getting big headed or fall? And I guess the other thing you were probably going to say is, you know, because you had mentioned that kind of the narcissistic prideful bent the other side, I'm sure is sexual immorality. And I'm not trying to put you on a pedestal, but I know that you were even talking this past Sunday about, you know, getting to know people and being shepherded by people who are genuinely humble. Can you talk a little bit about specifically in that first vein about the prideful part? What are what are things that you see or people that you have seen in leadership who've like, okay, these are some good practices to make sure that I'm remembering my actual place. Well, it's interesting. Yeah, I did reference being discipled in the area of humility in the last Sunday service. And it's I just got a comment, like there are plenty of pastors who who talk like this or say things like this, or even say it from the pulpit at one point in their ministry. And then later in their ministry, they kind of evolve or in my mind, devolve into their success. They begin to see their success as being about that. And so, one, I try to be very aware and prayerful of that. But two, and so one of the things I do is surround myself with people who who will argue with me and say no to me and, and, and push back and I try to make sure that those people have a voice and that they can have that voice, they can say those things, especially if it's at the personal level, if I hurt their feelings, or if I, you know, walked on them in some way or five, whatever, that they can, they can talk to me about that and be open with me about that. I try to make that always good. And, and there's enough of them that if they kind of got together and came to me and said, Hey, we feel like you stopped doing this. You stopped listening. You stopped whatever. Hopefully they could get my attention. And also being trying to be very open to that with my own family, with my wife and my kids, that they can speak openly into what they see in me, what they're experiencing in me. But being discipled in humility really was that in my twenties, I had already been put in my late twenties, early thirties, I'd already been put in a position of high authority and ministry. And, and I realized, man, I was very prideful. And, and I had known that about myself as a teenager and as a young man. I think that's pretty common among young men. But, but realize that what I realized suddenly was, oh shoot, all of a sudden my decisions matter. My opinions matter. I can be prideful and no one cared. It was just, you know, whatever. But now all of a sudden I realized I literally am, am filled with the chief sin, the first sin always listed when God lists the sins that God hates pride is always at the top. And, and here I am. And I had friends in my life who would tell me, and they would say it kindly, gently. They'd say things like, you know, sometimes you come across as arrogant or, you know, sometimes it seems like you're prideful. And what I realized was that's probably because I'm arrogant. That's probably the reason I come across as arrogant probably because that's probably a good guess is because I'm arrogant. And maybe I don't believe I am, but that would just be self-deception could easily self-deception. So I searched out a man who was humble and asked to mentor and disciple me. And we would discuss things and I would just see where my mindset and his diverge and then try to learn from him. Okay. Prayerfully, how do you respond to these things? How do you respond to criticism? And I still have a hard time being responded with my blindsides me. But that's what seems to trip my ego up the most is when I get blindsided by something. And so I have to be very aware of that. Like when I'm blindsided, I have to try to stop and like, okay, let's pause here for a second and, you know, get my heart rate back to normal and the surprise feelings behind my eyes go away. So there's that. But that's still, those are a couple, making sure it's available, seeking out discipleship in those key areas. And so I spent 10 years being discipled on a very, very regular basis weekly for a lot of that by a man who's a very humble man, a humble leader and trying to learn to do things the way he would do them. And he was trying to do them the way Christ would do them. So that combination was really, I think, very healthy and timely for me. Yeah. And was that early on in your ministry or was that as far as like being a lead pastor? I was long before I was a lead pastor. Okay. It was in my 30s and I didn't become a lead pastor until my mid 40s. And that probably helps too, that I was in my 40s before I became a lead pastor. So it's not, you know, I didn't have that, the arrogance that is so commonly associated with youth. It's not universally associated. Certainly there are plenty of wise and humble young men. I just wasn't one of them. And it's interesting because being a little arrogant, being pushy, being demanding, being all those things is also can be very inspiring and it does create followers. Right. They're who want to be led by someone who's strong and who demands a lot from them and who calls for a lot and a lot of those good things and they don't have to be connected to pride. They just often are. Yeah. And you have to make sure you've got people around you who can call you out. Yeah. You can model that themselves and they can call you out in it too. Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for taking time to kind of comment on that. Okay. So then, so you said a lot of times it's one of two things. So you kind of hit on the first one. What's the second one? So the second one is, is typically a moral failing. And though it used to be more common periodically to hear about, you know, pastor, I don't know, skimming money from the church or something. Yeah. I haven't heard a lot of that in a long time. The other one you hear about is sexual sin. Is that, is that there's a dominance. A guy gets into a situation like this and either his arrogance or whatever lends him to justify his own sin or to justify it, to hide it, to do whatever. Like recently the, there was an international ministry that after the leader of the ministry died, it turned out he had. Oh, hold on. Hold on a second. You'd, you kind of, you said after he died and then it kind of like started getting. Okay. Okay. I'm kind of pacing, so I'm maybe wandering into. All right. So anyway, after, after this, the leader of this ministry died, it came out that he had been really abusive and abusing his power and authority with women probably all over the world. Yeah. And it wasn't until after he was dead that the ministry did a, you know, did some serious work to uncover kind of the depths of it. And it was, it's pretty, pretty horrific. Yeah. I do a lot of people who were involved in those ministries and really, I mean, it was a big ministry. A lot of people involved in that and, and really wanting to be a part of it. And then to have that leader fall in such a, I don't know, obvious way, gross way. But he had used his spiritual leadership as a tool. Like he had told women, like, this is what God wants. God put you in my life. In one case, he apparently cited the passage about David having a young woman in his bed when he was an old man to keep him warm. And, and he, which, which is almost certainly just about keeping him warm. But though some people think that's a euphemism, I don't, I think it's literally to keep them warm. But, but the, but in this case, he was using that and saying, well, now as me as an old man, God has given me you to keep my bed warm. And they were engaging sexually and it just, it was just horrible. And so I think, but whether it's that or just, as we've seen recently with some who, they just have an inappropriate relationship, like they're, they're texting sexually and romantically with somebody. And in today's world, pornography, it's one of the things it can transition into very easily because of our cell phones and stuff like that is our smartphones is, is that they, it transitions over from, you know, I'm looking at, you know, pictures of somebody. Who I find attractive and they're engaged or dressed inappropriately or whatever to now I'm having literal interactions with real life people in my life in a way that it's like I'm using them for interactive pornography. And it's, it's really demeaning and unhealthy. But I, but I understand that. I mean, I have my addictions too. My addictions, I have a, an old fashioned early onset addiction to pornography, seeing pornography when I was really, really young. And so I have accountability in my life and restrictions and passwords and that I don't know and apps that get deleted and that kind of stuff in my own life as I try to keep the sin out of the camp in my own life. And I think it's just easy for a lot of these men, especially if you combine any of that narcissistic tendency to say, because I'm so important, I should be allowed a few, you know, indulgences or something. And I think, I think that's a big one. And it can be just as simple as inappropriate relationships. Pastors Sean, no, Shannon Etheridge wrote a book, Every Woman's Battle years ago. And in it, she starts the book saying something like, I'm paraphrasing here, but something like I was having affairs with five men, but none of them knew it. And she unpacked this idea that she had created of a lot of times when people have affairs, it's in their mind that they're saying, I wish my husband was more like blank. And I wish my wife is more like blank. And they begin to fantasize, create a fantasy husband or wife for themselves. And that's what she had done. She had created a fantasy husband for herself out of several different key men in her life. And of course, one of them was her pastor. And you've got to think that's common that a woman who's unhappy in her marriage, who's not being spiritually led well or whatever is sitting in the audience. And man, I mean, I'm at my best when I'm up on stage, you know, I don't, you don't get to see me irritated or tired or sick or short tempered or, or you can just, or, you know, just set, just satisfied or distracted, which is my worst. And so you don't see any of that. So it'd be easy to go, Oh, you know, you know, being married to him would be great. Well, yeah, probably being married to that guy would be great. Right. I mean, that's why I try to be the real me on stage and try not to hide that stuff. And I'm going to come in a minute to what I think is one of the biggest ones. But there's, but there's so much talk about these things. Right. And I, well, I just think that, you know, there's an, there's an aspect of being, you know, an inspirational, charismatic teacher that is really great. And that, that the Lord really does utilize, you know, and I think that's where it's like, okay, well, not, not that you're being fake, but it's like, you're using the gifts of the Lord has given you. It's only to me, a testament of man, our hearts are just so untrustworthy that we even, you know, we take these good things that God has given us and think God is using to even equip us and twist them. You know, I'm just thinking from that, from that angle, you can probably see it from a lot of different, a lot of different angles, but anyway, I cut you off. That's exactly right. No, no, not at all. That's a great, that's a great point. And that is, yeah, it's, that's the thing is it's a good thing that God has given us. And then our temptation is to make it about us versus about him. And that's true for, again, that's, that sounds so churchy. Like, oh, everybody says that. No, I mean, I say it because it's true. No matter what our talents and gifts are, whether it's, you know, it's something, something more simple, something more common, something more hidden, something more public, something more dramatic, like whatever it is, if it's, if your abilities are incredibly gifted at music or incredibly gifted at technology, like none of those, those are all still about him. Right. For the Christian, our identity is still in him. It doesn't, it's not just the preacher who has this problem, it's everybody. But preachers get to fall in really dynamic ways. Right. And as part of it, every, a lot of Christians fall in their faith at different times, but when, when big lead pastors, especially big tens of thousands mega church member pastors do it, well, it makes news. I mean, that's like it's splash. And so, so just, just being able to say, how do I, what are the boundaries I put in my life? I mean, we look at a guy like Billy Graham, who, man, I think, I think if there was scandal, it would have come out by now. Because everybody wanted there to be a scandal about him. And he didn't. And I think it's because he was humble enough and he drew healthy boundaries in his life around his marriage and his family. And I mean, there were stories about, you know, he had to send people into hotel rooms ahead of him because people would find out where he was going to be. And they would station a photographer and a naked woman in the room and try to catch him in a photo. And I don't know if that's true, if that's just legend, but I remember reading, hearing about that kind of stuff and thinking, man, that's how hard people wanted this guy to fall. And he didn't. And so to examine his life and try to figure out, okay, how did he, I mean, he was at the level of power and authority and influence in the world that people were probably trying to get into fall left and right to use, to abuse his influence, abuse his power. And it doesn't seem like he did, which is, you know, that is a miracle, not because of Billy Graham, because he's human. Right. Exactly. And the other thing, man, is to have that type of success, attention and notoriety and not fall. I respect, I respect any president or governor or leader who doesn't fall because I know they have the opportunity to. Yeah. So it's a big deal. And we don't, of course, we don't hear about the thousands of pastors who faithfully pastor their whole lives and never stumble in any, you know, career ending or ministry ending way. Yeah. And they don't stumble. Everyone does. Right. But it's not like, yeah, to where it's like they completely lose their witness. Yeah. And so another thing that I've heard you say, Chris, is when you're talking about kind of younger, the younger generation, when they, because they've seen a lot of pastors fall, when they see a young leader, they tend to think, oh, well, he just hasn't fallen yet. Mm hmm. Does how, how does that kind of play into because I'm sure there are people who are of that demographic who are listening or will listen and kind of have that mindset when it comes to leaders. And and I don't know if it's cynicism. I don't know if it's just like, well, I've been hurt before or what. But how, how, how do you see that playing into this context in this conversation? Well, and, and keep in mind now with the rates of divorce where they are, they've already seen the key stability in their life. They've already seen that in. Oh, right, right, right. And so why would anything else be more stable than my parents' marriage? And so since my parents' marriage isn't stable, why would I think anything else is going to ever be stable? So when you start there, I mean, you're kind of starting at a huge deficit. Yeah. And then, and then to move forward from there, you know, having a youth minister fall or a pastor fall or you see it on the media when some, you know, big name televangelist turns out to be a total hypocrite or a con artist. And like those things kind of add together and it becomes very easy, especially when you've been abused and we flat out abused in the name of Christ by a pastor or a minister and you've been sexually abused or physically abused or something like that. Like, yeah. I mean, how do you come back from that? How do you trust that? And the answer is it's going to be super hard at the emotional level. But, but the truth is, you know, like there was a Wayne Watson song 25 years ago that wasn't very famous, but that I liked called That's Not Jesus. And it was one example after another like that. And then he would say, but that's not Jesus. He doesn't carry on that way. That was just some flesh and blood like you and me that has somehow gone astray. And that's that is a truism. It is truth that of course we have that. And of course it's going to be hard. And of course, by the way, I'm all about people being, if not cynical, at least dubious. I'm pretty jaded to it myself that I'm OK if people come visit our church and go, yeah, I'll wait and see. You know, that's OK. Do that. Be able to do that. I hope you don't have to do it. You should be able to. I'm certainly a skeptic. So I do that myself quite a bit, mostly about me, but about other other things and people as well. But so everything from being being able to recognize me like like John Redford a few weeks ago, talking on stage about, you know, that he kind of yelled at his son on a Wednesday night and it's hard to get his son's attention. I get it. I've been there and I have a kid like that, too. It's very hard to get his attention. And so John kind of barked at him to get his attention and it startled some people. And so John on Sunday morning just stepped up and was like, hey, some of you heard that. And that was, you know, me being flesh and blood. That was me, you know, thinking, well, if I yell at a storm, it'll storm less, which is ridiculous that I can help end the chaos by yelling. Well, that's probably not going to work out very well. And he did a brilliant job, almost poetry, in my opinion, of sharing that. And we try to model that with the leaders in our church. So that's why I, you know, reference, I have certain clothes that I can wear on Sunday morning that are my, they're when I'm in a skinny place and there are others when I'm in a fatter place. And because my other addiction is sugar. And so, and so like, so I, I, I describe myself once as the Oprah Winfrey of pastors that may not translate very well anymore. But I meant back in the day when she was always losing and gaining, you know, 20 or 30 pounds between episodes almost. And you'd be like, what? And, but then like four episodes later, she's right back to her heavier weight. Like, Oh yeah, that's, that's kind of, that's kind of me. Anyway, it's, it's, I think part of it is the recognition that we're all frail and we're all sexually frail and we're all needy and we all have hang ups when it comes to sex. And if you don't draw healthy boundaries and if you don't have good accountability, and then here's the biggest one for me, Colson, I got to tell you that has scared me over the years is I've had several lead pastors tell me, and I mean, not in a confession way, but in a instructive way. Hey, just know you can't be friends with your congregation. Yeah. You can't be friends with your staff and you can't be friends with your leadership. And I'm like, well, I don't want to do this. Right? Like it was the point. And why, why, why do my whole thing, what is the whole, what's the, what's the reasoning behind that? Well, it's, I think I can give you, they say because it's been so much worse when things go badly. It's so much worse when people stab you in the back. It's so much worse when you have to fire somebody. It's so much worse. And what struck me even as they were saying it at the time, and I had to listen to them because they had more experience than I did and really listen and have to dig in and think about what I believed and then talk to others as well. And what I realized they mean was it's so much harder on them. It's so much harder on your, on you when you have to fire a staff member who is a friend. The truth is though, it may be easier on the staff member because you can love them through it as a friend, even though you're the one who has to make a call to fire them. Right. It's that much harder when I leave, if God calls me to another church or calls me to another job or another career, it's that much more painful for me if I'm leaving a bunch of friends. Well, yeah, but I mean, I just can't see another way to do it that can be even vaguely healthy. Yeah. So I try to have close friendships with people on staff and with people in the church and with leadership and with others. And I mean, there may be certain things that getting together a group of pastors that we can talk about that would not be easy to talk about in other places. That's true. I think that's true of any career path, especially one that has responsibilities. But man, I just, I think that's why they fall is because they don't have a Jonathan. Yeah. And, you know, Jonathan is so sad. Jonathan was dead before David falls with Bathsheba and Uriah and that whole nightmare where he breaks essentially all 10 commandments in a period of six months. And I've always said, how sad that at that stage in his life, there was no one in David's life who could come to him and say, why are you still in the palace? And it says very clearly in that passage. It was, you know, spring when Kings go to war and David was in his palace. It's a clear editorial on the fact that David's not supposed to be in his palace and his men are out fighting and he's not with them. And it's not good. But there's no one in David's life who could come and say, hey, what are you doing here? Your men are in war and you're here. Get up off your rear end, get off that throne and go to war with your men. Well, you're not, you shouldn't be here. And when I asked my wife one time, hey, so if I started really messing up, if I really started kind of going off the deep end in some way, are there people in my life who you could kind of call in to confront me? That you could send into the throne room, so to speak and say, hey, what are you doing? And she kind of chuckled. She was like, oh, there's a huge line of people who would love nothing more than to get to call you out in that moment. Call you out in that moment. You're like, okay, great, great. That's all I needed to hear. Yeah, exactly. That's all I needed to know. Exactly. Yeah. Well, and so kind of going back to what we had been talking about specifically with leaders that had been outstanding, falling, or even that it comes out after they've passed away, I think a lot of times, and I'm even, and I can get discouraged by this too, and I'm sure other people do, of like, oh, well, does this just discredit everything they were talking about? Yeah. You know, because I know that there, I mean, there is even another podcast that I was listening to recently of like talking about building up the, or talking about like restoring the credibility of the church and how those things can kind of diminish the credibility in a way in the public eye. And so what, I don't know, if somebody's, that if that's somebody's question, their deconstruction of like, look, I was, I really held this person in high regard. I mean, and I know you, we have said like, okay, you know, we need to deconstruct our faith in humanity. What do you say to people who are like, can I still believe this? Even though this person who I really thought was living the right way, wasn't like, should I now stop listening to their old sermons and things that I really was comforted and encouraged by? Yeah. That's a, so one, should you stop listening to their old sermons or should you, you know, throw away all your notebooks or that kind of stuff? I don't think that's necessary, though it's certainly understandable. Right. It's certainly understandable why you would go like, I just don't feel like I can trust them. Well, apparently you can't. Right. You can't trust them. And it's a great, you know, it's one of those moments I think that most of us face at some point when we do have to decide, is my faith in my parents or is it in God? Is my faith in my youth minister or is it in God? Now I'm not, I'm not minimizing those people. I mean, they need to answer for that. When they bring things down, when they do that, when they cause one of these little ones to stumble, I mean, Jesus is pretty clear about that. That's not okay. You need to be careful not to ever do that. And yet people do. So the answer would be the truth has to still be the truth no matter who says it. That if someone who is absolutely, you know, an anti-religion, atheistic, you know, ungod, whatever, just pick the furthest from the truth. But if they say something that's true, it's still true. Right. And a pastor who is, you know, a wolf in sheep's clothing, if what they said is true, it's still true. Now, you certainly now have to go back and reevaluate is what they said true at a new level. Was it true or were they using that to manipulate and lie like a cult leader or converse? And so you can evaluate it for its truth. I've actually moved people who have been from a therapy perspective, needed to work through this. We'll go back and listen to old sermons from people like that and we'll evaluate them. Is this true or is it not? Is this true or is it not? But it's weird for them because a lot of times they've never put themselves in the position to evaluate these people. Yeah. So it's just like, well, like thinking critically, thinking on their own kind of a thing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What does the Bible actually say? So to go back and evaluate, okay, is this right? What they said right is the example they used as a teach what it needs to teach. And I'm amazed at how often people just very uncritically listen to a pastor or a teacher and then just swallow that. And I hope for their sake it's true versus what happened in the church of Berea in the book of Acts. That when Paul came and taught to them, they then went back to the scriptures and tested what he said against the scriptures before they decided to believe what he said. And I think that's appropriate. I think that's totally, that's a good thing to do is that you want a leader, a pastor, a teacher who is humble and who is learning and who doesn't think they have all the answers and who doesn't have it all together and is able to acknowledge that, who is able to have friends in the church, in his congregation and among his leaders who is willing to do those things. And I mean, I'm not saying those things because they're things about me. I try to make those things true about me because I think they are right. They're true. And but I totally understand it. And we would love to, I mean, gosh, we'd be happy for anybody who says, I don't know what to do. This person who I had placed my trust in has abandoned me, has been unfaithful to me. There's a lot of ways that it feels like spiritual adultery when a pastor falls that, you know, they've been with that pastor sometimes five years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and then they fall. Well, that feels a little bit like if your spouse cheated on you. Like I've got to go back and reevaluate everything. Looking back is, well, that wasn't true. Then what about this? Was this true? Was this true? Was this true? And it can be so disconcerting and understandably so. And that's actually one of the things I enjoy doing as a counselor and as a pastor is talking through that with people. Just talking through, hey, you've been let down and you're going to be let down again. And if you came to church in South spring, you're going to be let down again. I promise we will let you down. All of us will. And you'll let me down. So it's fair. I mean, you'll let me down. I'll let you down. That's how this works. But that doesn't mean we don't love each other. And because foundationally, I'm not dependent upon you and you aren't dependent upon me for our faith. And so, yeah, absolutely. It should cause us to go back and reevaluate them. Of course, it should cause us to go back and rethink what they taught us. And that can be a painful process for sure. And we're not obligated to continue to trust them or listen to them. We do have to figure out a process for forgiving them, which doesn't mean they become our pastor again. Doesn't mean we let them babysit our children. It doesn't mean we loan them money. It doesn't mean any of that kind of stuff. It just means that at some point we come to the place of realizing Christ has paid all our debts and we can afford to forgive other people their debts, no matter how awful they are. And that's a hard process. And we don't have time on this podcast to talk about that. But it can be a challenging, hard covenant to decide to forgive somebody. And there'll be days when you're good at it and days when you're bad at it. It's like with any other covenant. But yeah, that is something Christ calls us to. And Christ is the one we listen to, not people when there's disagreement. So it's understandable why that would be so hard. And I will tell you, it's infuriating. As a pastor, it is infuriating when we see a pastor fall in pride or arrogance or lust, whatever fleshly thing they fall into, especially when they've lied about it, they've pretended like they had it all together. That stuff is just infuriating me as a pastor because it does put a dark mark against the gospel. Yeah. Man. Experientially, not truthfully, but experientially. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. Anyway, well, so this is something we're seeing and we would love for anybody who needs to reach out and say, that's me. You're talking about me. My pastor, the person I admired, my ministry leader turned out to be a horrible person. And if it's just that you got crossways with them, well, you're both horrible people. And so that's going to happen sometimes between humans. Humans are going to get crossways with each other because we're horrible. But sometimes it truly is a one directional. Someone just fell and failed. And how do we restore them appropriately? How do we confront them appropriately? Those are all conversations I've had with many people over the years and know I'll have more. And it's sad, but it's what we would predict as Christians. Yeah. Yeah. Any faith you put in humans is eventually going to get let down to one degree or another. Oh, yeah. Well, if you're listening right now, and this is something that you have walked through and the Lord has used to, you know, to grow something in you or you have a story to share, we'd love to hear that. And so please feel free to reach out to me at clechner at southspring.org. We can kind of continue that conversation. Any closing thoughts, Chris? Thank you so much for taking a call and sharing. Even though you're out in the wilderness, there is a little bit of wind, but for the most part, you are you're you're easy to hear. And I think we'll be able to get some some really good meat out of the conversation, despite the elements. Good, good. Well, maybe my my lack of sleep may be less clear, but being out in the wilderness, maybe that makes my thoughts clear. So hopefully there'll be something valuable in that conversation. And I would tell somebody exactly what we kind of end the podcast with. Don't give up. Keep struggling. Keep trying. Keep asking those hard questions and keep digging in. And when humans let us down, we grieve, we mourn, we struggle. We can be persecuted, but we're not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed. And that's hopefully the perspective we can take, even when those nearest to us fall. And I hate to think about how that would have been affected, like what are these people's kids and spouses and what do they deal with? But but it's real for us as well. So for us to allow ourselves to grieve and struggle, but remind ourselves where our help comes from. And it's not primarily it's not fundamentally from other humans. Yeah, as important as we are. There you go. Yeah, great word. Well, thanks, Chris. And thank you for listening. And we'll see you in the next episode. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
