We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. And on today's episode, we're changing. We're all politics this time. It's all about politics. All those sounds you just heard were people turning off or switching to the next podcast. I don't want any more politics. No, no, no, no, that is not what we're doing. But when we were off off air, we were just talking and I think just touching base over the fact like we we are living in a very politically charged time. At least that's kind of what is inundating people's news cycle. A lot of very popular media, even like on podcast platforms, YouTube personalities. That is an interesting way that politicians are trying to get into people's feeds to learn, you know, to kind of educate people of what their policies are and where they stand. And so I feel like at least in my echo chamber or algorithm that politics is a very hot topic. And I think it probably you probably say that across the country. And so that being said, we're like, we don't want to turn into a political podcast. And so that's not what we're doing. But I think it would be beneficial for us to have a conversation again about allegiance and loyalty. And what does it mean to be a believer and then engage with politics in various ways. And so I don't know, Bryn, can I throw it over to you? And you just kind of tee up our conversation a little bit more from the disaster that I just did in the introduction? No, no, no, we were talking about it. And like you're saying, we would be entertaining if we did a, you know, just purely political episode, but that's not our goal for the podcast as a whole. So we were talking about when it comes to Christian faith and deconstruction and reconstruction, kind of how do politics fit in with this, our roles as Christians, like, because we do have a previous episode talking about how politics can contribute to deconstruction. And so we just talked about that purely from that standpoint of like, okay, as believers, or even if you're in the deconstruction process, kind of trying to wrestle with, like, I see a lot of people who claim to be believers that are acting in a lot of different ways, kind of just unpacking those things when it comes to how do we handle these conversations more of like, not what do we think about all of these political figures, but how do we handle the conversations? Right. Or how do I reconcile this? Yeah, what's a good framework to not get really discouraged this time around every year or two four. Because I think, well, I think it's really easy. I think that's accurate. I think it's really easy for us to get swept up with culture and then confused in a lot of ways as believers. So we thought it would be important from that standpoint. But yeah. Very cool. Totally. Especially in a time of moral relativism on one side, and then like, religious nationalism on another side. I feel like it's just easy to be like, whoa, not a whole lot of common ground. So I don't know, Chris, what is, as we tee up that, where does your mind go first of all to the listener who's like, man, I'm struggling already. And now throw in politics. Throw in things of like, I'm already thinking a lot and my brain is already kind of hurting because I'm asking these hard questions. And now I'm also trying to figure out who to vote for. It's a very personal thing. Or in addition to that, I'm hurting as a person because of like how Christians have treated me in the past or whatever. And now I'm like seeing how everyone acts around elections. And that kind of exacerbates it. Or even people I care about, you know, people I care about. But I see things differently. We both believe in Jesus, you know, and he's a bedrock for our, but we have very differing views. And yeah, I don't know. Lots of things there. Yes. I know there's a bunch. And we're going to figure it out in these 30 minutes. So no pressure. So we're going to solve it. Oh, sorry. We went down for there for a second. But luckily we solved all the things. Yeah, great. And we just picked back up recording again. So sorry, y'all missed it. So we're gonna, yeah, I come at it very much so, you know, years ago, I saw online Tony Evans do a deal where he compares Christians in the political realm to referees in a football game. And that's been super helpful for me is like, yeah, we don't unpack that. We don't play for one team and we don't play for the other team. Both teams want us to be on their side. And both teams are happy for us to be on their side if it helps them win. But but they they actually aren't on our side. We're not on anyone's side except the side of the rule book. And we report to the rule book and the rule book is who we have to answer to someday, not not one team or the other. So you know, you've got the Cowboys playing the, you know, the Saints or something. And it's like, I'm not playing for the Saints. I'm not playing for the Cowboys. I will reward whoever follows the rules. And I will, you know, so to speak, punish, so to speak, the ones who will not the team that doesn't, there's a consequence for us. And, and that's the that's really our position. And the way we, you know, to go back to the concept of reward and punishment is silly, except that you realize it's really about giving serving and voting. Right. And so I am the founding fathers. It's really intriguing. Our founding fathers depended on the idea that Americans would vote their conscience, not just their opinions, not just who they liked better, not just all those different headings, but their conscience that this is this is a vote about right and wrong and that every election at some level is about right and wrong. And that that's how we would treat it. And if there was a right and wrong aspect, and that's, that's how I do it. I have five different moral headings in my mind, and I watch how the different parties handle those moral headings. And if I think someone's right, then I'm willing to support them. And if I think they're wrong, I'm not willing to support them. And if by some chance, you know, both parties had the same right or the same wrong views, when it came to morality, that I would, you know, I would have to figure some other way to decide how to vote if I was going to vote. I don't know if that makes sense. That makes sense? Yeah, I think so. So on those on those five topics, if they're and if someone's right, you know, someone has is more right on those kind of five main views than someone else. Like more aligned biblically. Yeah, more aligned biblically with with what I think is morally appropriate. So and then again, it goes back to then you're voting your conscience right now. Yeah. And there was Oh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, you're good. Well, and again, that would leave me with, I'm willing to vote pure policy. And I would love to if both at today, both lead parties were right about, you know, all five issues or the or the we're both coming at the moral issues from the right perspective, in my opinion, but there you go. So anyway, that's a that's part of how I do it from that perspective. And I'm willing to discuss those things. But I'm very it's, you know, hugely, hugely important not to take it personally, when someone disagrees. And when someone disagrees with me on one of these five moral issues, then I discuss it as a moral issue, not a political issue. And we discuss it the way we would discuss morality, not the way we would discuss voting. Yeah, those are different. Do you think that's one of the reasons why it's so easy for people? Do you think that are like as far as the discord or, or the inability to have good conversation from it? Is it because we're taking a we're taking issues that aren't political that are actually moral or something like that, making them political. And so now we're, we're really upset about politics. But it's like, it's actually not because our politics are different. It's because our morals are different. I think sometimes that's the case. And, and I think, I think more often we could have those conversations maybe more faithfully. You know, if we were to be more intentional about that kind of stuff, I think we might could, you know, help with some of that. I think it would be better if we had those conversations that way, for sure. Okay. That if we were like, okay, and, and by the way, we may, we may end up disagreeing on the moral issues and that's a big deal. But understanding what the reason that matters to me is at that point, you're not debating, you know, you're not going like, Oh, what we have a problem with each other is the fact that we're, you know, ones are Republicans with a Democrat. It's like, no, no, the actual issue that we're facing is much deeper than that. And that's a more difficult, long-term sophisticated conversation, not just a meme about politics. Yeah. And sometimes by the way, there are even psychological issues. Like right now there's a lot of issues of safety. I have a lot of feeling safe. So I have several friends online who when they post, do you mean like physically safe or like financially? Whatever it is. It's like, you know, people post like, if you say you love someone, you can't vote for someone who makes them feel unsafe. Okay. Um, and like that being posted is a, like, I don't, I don't think that's a good, like, I don't think that's a realistic standard is what causes people to feel safe. Like I don't, I don't see that as something that's plausible or feasible, but it's still an okay conversation. How do we help people feel safe? It's a, is a, you know, a good conversation to have. Um, but that's a, seems impossible. Brynn, where does, where does your mind go right now as we're considering the, what our goal is for the podcast and then kind of what, where we find ourselves in this conversation? So my first thought just from Chris's comment is I think, like, I agree with you. I think that's a great way of looking at things. I think the mistake that a lot of people make or one of the mistakes that people make is they take a political stance and make it a moral issue because it's their political stance. And I think, I think that is really harmful. It's, it, first of all, it kind of equates all political issues as equal morally. And I don't think you can make that case biblically of like, you know, we could, we could give examples, but like, there are just some things that are like more clearly laid out in scripture than other political issues. And I think there's a big danger when, like you're saying, I think it's really healthy to take the issues that you find moral and biblical and then kind of seeing where in politics those are supported or upheld. But then what I think a lot of Christians slip into without realizing it is they take a moral stance and make everything on their political party supported biblically or, or on equal standing as all other moral issues, if that makes sense. And I think, I think that's problematic for a lot of reasons. Just one being like an understanding of scripture, but two, like you're saying, even when it comes to interacting with others in a loving way, I think, yeah, that's one thought that I had. But I think the other thing it kind of goes back to like we talked about in one of our other episodes, that our primary loyalty and our primary citizenship is heaven and is, is Christians. And we see in scripture that we're supposed to be aliens and strangers. And yet I think our sin and in our sin, we still are pulled to belonging here on earth. We see that all the time. Like we want to belong and we want that to supersede or we are willing to sacrifice our identity as Christians for that. I think that's always going to be a pull. And I think politics is like a way that we slip into that. It's like a way that we want to belong. It's a people that we want to belong to whichever side we choose or whatever group we align with. Like we want that to become our identity. Or we choose that as an identity above our Christianity and above our, you know, discipleship under Jesus. And I think that's like the most problematic thing for Christians is when their primary identity is Republican or Democrat or libertarian above being a believer, or because they're a believer, then they are also assumed to be a political party. And I think, I think that's, there are a lot of things to look out for, but I think that's probably one of the most problematic when it comes to just believers and then also believers causing or contributing to deconstruction in other, other people of like, wow, you're like confusing a lot of things and what it means to follow Jesus. And, and you're saying that this means following Jesus when that's actually nowhere in scripture and you're combining your identity with Christianity with a political party. Yeah. So I think anyway, that was kind of a lot, but I think that's kind of my main thought when it comes to politics and something that we see often and is honestly hard to push against for a lot of people. Like it is once you feel really strongly about a political side or political candidate, it's really hard not to just heart and soul support them. And remember, like Chris is saying, Oh, I don't, this is not the primary team that I'm playing for. And that may mean that because I'm a Christian, not only does that change the way my conduct is when it comes to political interactions, which is like a whole separate part of this conversation, but it changes the way I like interact with all of these things. So that means, yeah, if someone that is the other side is more aligned biblically on this issue, I have to be willing to say like, Oh wow, they're right about that. Um, even if that's cognitively really painful for me, because they're not my side, quote unquote. Right. Um, I dunno, does that make sense? I think it does. I, uh, a couple, a couple of things that I had thoughts on as you're talking, Brad, the first one was it is interesting. Like I'm, I'm curious how, um, you know, Chris, you were even just talking, were you, were we on air when you were saying a couple chose to come and, uh, he came to our church. I don't think I was, I don't think we were on air at that point, but, um, someone, a couple who comes to our church, who I heard about kind of secondhand was that she said they, they were saying they have different political views, but they're both, they, they like coming here because we just teach what scripture says and not get political intentionally. But it's when, when it, you know, when scripture touches on something, that's a political topic, we don't shy away from that. Right. But it's not like, but it's not the other way around. Not a, yeah, it's a biblical topic, not a political topic. And you got to deal with that as Christians for sure. As, and I think, you know, we, we're seeing a lot of these topics come across as church leaders, right? Like our perspective is also as leaders of, of a Christian, uh, church here. Right. But I am curious your thoughts as like, um, poli it like in politics, getting in the way of ministry in, in, in the thought of somebody listening to this podcast and, and it's like, man, are we, are we making politics more of what it is and making it more of because what we believe is as believers and, and our great commission is go and make disciples of Christ Jesus, not go and make disciples of a conservative political agenda. Yeah. You know, or liberal. Exactly. Exactly. And so it's like, I'm just curious for those, for those people who might feel like an outsider. Yeah. How do, how are they trying to maybe wrestle with the idea of politics when it's like, it feels like this is more important than what your actual mission is. Um, yeah. So I don't know. So that was kind of my, my initial thought. Um, the, the other thing I was going to say is, uh, this last week I got to hear a couple speak, uh, at a conference and they are Arab Israeli Christians that live in Israel in Nazareth. And so it was like, it was a very interesting. And so the wife was talking a lot about, uh, her identity. And she even referred to it as her identities. So, and I'm an Israeli woman who is a Christian in that area. And so like a lot of those things come under, um, come under attack. Or there's like, if, if this is what I'm basing my life on, then they're like, my life is going to crumble. Yes. Because it's like, there's always things that are, that are being, um, she didn't, and she didn't use the word persecuted, but it is, it is interesting. It's like, if you don't have, it's not that these identities are wrong, it's that if you have them in the wrong order or, and by that I mean like priority, yeah, priority, then there's a, it can just cause a lot of heartache and a lot of trouble for you personally. And so I think that that was, that was kind of coming to mind as we're talking about this, it's like, it's not that we're saying that it's wrong to be to have a liberal mindset. If, you know, it is where your priorities stand and your, you know, your loyalty and your citizenship, if you're considering what you are, at least from our perspective as a Christ follower, there is, it's easier to see like, well, this is, we would say that you're probably off if your political leanings are more important to you than your, your biblical, you know, your Christian identity. I would say if your political leanings are more important than your Christian identity, then you probably aren't a Christian. Right. Yeah. I'm not stating that unequivocally, but it's like, you're certainly missing something key that is off base because our, our identity in Christ supersedes all other possible aspects of identity. Right. Father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, American, Texan, you pick it. All of them are superseded. And in fact, all of them, I have to be willing to jettison the instant they put me in competition with my identity as a follower of Christ. And so, you know, maybe I'm overstating it to say, if someone said to me about anything like, Oh, I'm, I'm a, I'm a Christian born again believer, but my identity as a business owner is more important to me than I'd be like, um, then I'm not sure you're a Christian. Right. Like, I feel like that's a, that's a fair argument or at least a fair confrontation. So anyway, even if they're more passionate about politics, I think that's like a more, probably a more people are going to claim it, but they're going to see, you're going to look like it in that. Right. The fruit of it. Yeah. Yeah. A few people are going to say like, yeah, this is more important to me, but it's like, if your life shows that that's what you're most passionate about, and if things about who God calls you to be bow in allegiance to who your party calls you to be, then that's like really telling. Um, and I think this is like one of the things that you have to be really, we have to be really humble about in either accepting critique from friends and family or even assessing ourselves, asking the Holy Spirit to convict us because I think it's really easy for us to get sucked into everything that is acceptable politically. And so I think there are certain behaviors that are, um, just kind of assumed about how, how you are, if you're, um, really in support of a political party or the fact that it's like, if you are one of us, like I said earlier, you can't like give them any points basically. And if you do, then, you know, like all these different behavioral things that culturally we get sucked up into. And it's like, no, as believers, we have to be apart from that. And the minute we get sucked into it, it starts, um, basically asking us to compromise how Christ calls us to interact in the world, you know. Um, and I think we have to be really humble about that because I was talking to, um, and this is not me commenting on a political issue, but I think I can't really make this point without saying what we were talking about. But I was, I was talking about immigration with a friend and, um, a friend who grew up in primarily really conservative circles, um, but a friend who ended up in adulthood working with a lot of, um, illegal immigrants and immigration and just, um, you know, a lot of those fears and working with people who were like here illegally. And so there, the, my friend's comment was, it's one thing to have a political stance on something, but when it starts to push you to not care for the souls of people, you can have a stance on whether or not you think the border should be open, how the U S should accept people, what we should do about that. Like that's a political stance. But if it then pushes you to dehumanize people in the way that you think and talk about them because they're under that political category, then it is coming into contradiction with who you are as a Christian of like, you can still have a political stance, but she was just saying how many Christians she saw who like didn't view the people that she interacted with as human because they felt like because of their political stance, they had to like, if they viewed them as human at all, if they viewed them as people with stories, then they were giving a point to the other side. Does that make sense? Um, and that was like a great example to me of this problem of like, wow, you can have even a political opinion on something, but how Christ calls you to interact in this world, um, comes first above, you know, the stance that you take on different things. I don't know if I'm saying that clearly, but I think so. I feel like you are. Cause I think, and I think you can, you know, I think you can look at a lot of different things with that same mindset. Cause it's, it's easy to generalize, you know, the issue at the border. It's easy to generalize homelessness, right? And mental illness and suicide and though, you know, those types of things. And I know not all of those are particularly political, but I think what you are saying is like, if it's, if we're, if we take the people out of that and the, and then just, yeah, relegate it to kind of a talking point. Yeah. And assign motives to the other side. I think that's also where we step into like, uh, behavior that is not in line with who Christ calls us to be. When we automatically assume that because someone believes something or has a political stance that we know everything about them. We know what they think. We know the condition of their heart. Like we can make all these moral assessments about them instead of just like having honest conversations with them. Like Chris was saying, I think, um, would go a long way. I think both, both primary parties, um, talk a lot about, um, you know, going across the aisle, but like realistically, that's not how we act as a country. Like that's not something that we're actually seeking. Um, but Christ gives us a framework to actually do that unlike politics. Um, and to, you know, I don't know. So yeah, because we prioritize, and because we prioritize one Christ above all other things, that's why that works. Right. And if you, if your identity is your political party, then it makes sense why you would support it at all costs and slip into what a lot of people do where it's like, okay, then you start saying things that are false about the other side or false about your side and twisting the truth and hiding things. And you know, like all this stuff that we see, um, in every political party, um, because your identity becomes supporting your quote unquote side at all cost. And I think it, yeah, it's just really harmful for Christians to get sucked into, but sorry, I've done a lot of the talking, but no, that's good. This is, this was a good part of the conversation. Brin, Brin for president 2028. She has my old enough to be present. Uh, no, 36. Is that what it is? 35. I think I give it 35. Oh, well, you'll be there. You'll be there. I will be by the election. So that's what I'm saying. That's what it's going to be. Wonderful. Okay. Well, is there anything else you guys wanted to say on that? I think it's good. And I think for people to hear that is just a good reminder. You know, it's a good reminder for us as Christians that, that if we have something more important to us than politics and therefore that allows us the freedom to talk with people, even when we disagree with them, because we see them as being valuable in the image of God and being treasure to him. And even if they don't see us the same way, or if we don't, they don't understand it the same way. That is our basic worldview as to other humans. And so even the ones that disagree with this, it gives us the opportunity to love people who we would disagree with. Even if it is on a moral issue, we can still love them from that perspective. So much less merely a political one. Can I say one more thing? Yeah, please do. One other thought that I had while we were talking earlier is, I think emotions and how we let Jesus govern our emotions has a big part in this. Because I think any of us who have gotten really excited about a political issue or really fired up watching a debate or any of those things have felt how good it feels to just get really worked up about these things. And sometimes I think that is leaning more into our sin. And yet it's really easy to justify because we see so much of it around us. And I think that's just one of the thought I had of, like, man, it's really easy to get addicted to outrage or addicted to mocking someone else. And I think it's really easy for us to justify that because it's political season. And I think it's one of those things just like, yeah, sometimes gossip feels really good. That doesn't mean it's what God calls us to. And I think that is really convicting to me often of like, man, how not only in the way that I'm interacting with people, but internally, how am I submitting those feelings to the Lord and how much of this is just me playing into my flesh. And how much of that is like, wow, that's something I need to surrender to the Lord in this process. And maybe, you know, Lord willing lead others in the way that I'm doing that, even though it's it may be painful and hard to surrender those things. So just another thought, both externally, how we how we interact and then internally. And I think that is such a, I mean, that's a, I feel like that's a lot of the political discussion or or at least clickbaity things are like common outrage. Right. Like, it's like, so I guess my question that then comes from that is, is it is it appropriate to be outraged, Chris? And and when would if it is, then when would you consider that like, oh, I mean, as a follower of Christ, it is it is okay to be outraged here. And then where is it like, I don't know. I don't know. Kind of depends on what you mean by outrage. Because I know that there's like an emotional side of things. But I don't know. As a therapist, what do you think? Well, even the like, so outrage, if you mean outrage from like, I am infuriated by this, or I'm, you know, shocked by this, or all the things that go with that. I mean, I think as Christians, the things that make God angry should make us angry. And so when we can make the case in Scripture that like, something, something in our culture would make him angry, then it it's appropriate for it to for it to one degree or another make us angry. Now, if you mean expressing outrage, as in, I'm angry about this, or this is a problem, or whatever. I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess there's a place for that for sure. A stance to be taken or a perspective to be taken or whatever. That being said, I think outrage very often is communicated as like, I don't have to it, I can now treat people badly, because they have created outrage for me, or they have caused me to feel outrage, and therefore, I can treat them badly. And and I think we just have to remember that even in the case of outrage, it's not our place to cast judgment, you know, final judgment on someone, we're still to see them as valuable and worth while created in his image. But, you know, so yes, I'm going to be outraged by the things that I think God would be outraged by, that should motivate me to outrage and I should work in such a way as to reduce those things in any place or among any group of people that I care about. I mean, part of why I want our country to have certain views is because I love our country and I want it to have right good morally appropriate views. That being said, I can't like, my outrage doesn't determine anything. Maybe that's what's valuable for people to be reminded is that my outrage may just be my outrage. And that doesn't affect anything. That doesn't change anything that doesn't cause anything to happen just because I'm outraged. That doesn't mean I'm right. That's just my psychological state. Anyway, I feel like I'm kind of rambling a little bit here. No, I'm curious. I am genuinely curious because I feel like it is just such a prevalent or buzz buzzy word when it comes to a response to political things as outrage. So thank you for also just kind of unpacking the term a little bit. Well, an outrage. Yeah, I think outrage can be a cheap response because it allows me to feel very strongly about it without ever actually like to do anything about it. Right. And so a lot of times the response I think of outrage is a little bit cheap, to be honest, because it's like, typically the way I see it is outrage often causes people to just demand that someone do something versus do something prompting people to action. Yeah. Yeah. I think if it's appropriate action, I think it's great. I think being like the lack of nuance is the hardest or the easiest option anyway, like all extreme responses seem just to kind of make something general. Easiest. Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it takes so much work for us mentally, emotionally, even like interpersonally. It's just going against the flow so much to choose something but an extreme emotion. Like you're saying, not that it's always wrong, but I think, yeah, it just seems like the easiest option to just jump to that always. And that would be your only response, like you're saying. Yeah, that's great. Well, guys, thank you so much for having that, having this conversation. Bryn, if you were to say kind of a couple of words to somebody who is listening. If I was running for president. Okay, yes. We'll record one outro and we'll use this in four years. But no, like if you've got a friend or somebody listening who's, yeah, who's maybe just, maybe even they're just a little bit weary of, can we just get this election over so that we can move on kind of a thing? Yeah. I don't know. What would you say to that person? Yeah, that's a good question. I think one, if you're not a believer, or if you're struggling with faith right now, I think I would want people to hear like we've said before, go to Jesus and who he is, because his followers often don't do a great job of representing who he is. And so once again, don't judge Jesus by, and who he is by people poorly representing him. So I think that's one thing that definitely applies in this situation of like, if you're seeing Christians who are not, or claiming to be Christians, A, that doesn't mean they all are. And B, that doesn't mean they're representing Jesus. Well, I think for Christians, just once again, encouraging us to ask really hard questions of ourselves. And just going back to, man, we are called to be aliens and strangers, which means we're going to feel really uncomfortable and not at home. If we're following Jesus well, I think that applies here. And then I think avoiding two extremes, like we've talked about one being, I don't think politics are unimportant, because like Chris said, there are things talked about that are talked about in scripture that God obviously cares about. So I don't think you can take the stance of, you can choose not to be involved in them, but I don't think you can take the stance that none of it matters at all. But I also think, like we've been saying, not going to the other extreme of this is all that matters. And this is how we will achieve salvation as a nation and going to that extreme and just going back to scripture. Faith is a resource of South Spring Baptist Church. Remember, don't give up.
