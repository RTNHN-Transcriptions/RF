We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Well, hey there. This is Colson Lechner dropping into the beginning of this episode to tell you a few things. One, to thank you for listening. I know it's been a while since we've posted an episode. And the last episode that we released actually, the sound quality was pretty poor. So I appreciate you bearing with us as we got that improved. And I did just want to quickly say that while the topic of today's episode that's releasing now, goodness, in June was recorded back in February of 2025. And obviously the events that we discussed aren't current anymore. I am really excited for you to hear Chris Legge and Dan Ray discuss some of the depth of how to have discussions about your faith and how to lovingly engage with others who believe differently than you do, but to do that with love and gentleness. So with all of that said, here's today's episode. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined as always by my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. We're all in studio today, which is a little bit different, which is great. And one of the main reasons why is because we have a special guest. And so, and he is also in the studio with us. So I'm going to throw it over to Chris for him to introduce a quick introduction of our, our special guest kind of give us a VIP. Yeah. Just kind of cue up what we're going to be talking about today. That's the real reason I'm here. Let's be honest. What's that? Our special guest. Cause Dan's here. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Hey Dan. Okay. So I'm going to let you in a minute talk about all the stuff you're doing right now to give just a little intro with that. But this is, this is Dan, Dan and I. Wow. It's 2017, 2016 somewhere around there. This would be the ninth or 10th year. Yeah. So that I, uh, that I was on Smalley's podcast, if you want to listen to those episodes with when we had him in here now, several years ago. Um, uh, and Dan's been on our podcast before. And, um, and so he's, um, he reached out to me after my conversation with Smalley and we talked and then developed a friendship and it has been a very mutual friendship for now. I was on, I was on just before you. Right. And it had to be 2015 cause I wasn't done with my master's degree yet. So it's 10 years that far back. I know. Cause I think we had him here in 2017 must've been when he, he and I were on stage. We had the debate. That was the first time. Yup. But then the podcast you guys did. Yup. And then Dave gave up his podcasts. He's well, he has somebody else doing, he has somebody else doing, he now is doing comedy full time now, I guess, but that's how we met. Maybe we talk about it. Yeah. So talk, tell, tell everybody who's listening just a quick snippet on kind of who you are, what you do and the resources that you provide and then we can start jumping in. I'm a staff apologist at watch man fellowship, which is watch man.org. We're in Arlington, Texas, and we are a interfaith evangelism ministry. We reach out to Mormons, Jehovah's witnesses, or I should say latter day saints now, but Jehovah's witnesses, atheists, Muslims, and we help equip the body of church to understand these non-Christian groups. And not only do we help educate people about them, we encourage people to engage with them. So as we like to say, it's a lot easier to talk about people than it is to talk with them. And so we, we want to encourage both, both and, and we've been, I've been at Watchman now for this is my sixth year and I do our two podcasts. I do, I write some of our profiles and I do some speaking and stuff like this. Great. But you can find it at watch man with an a.org. Yeah, that's a, that's probably pretty important. Watch man versus not watchman, not watchman or watchtower. Right. Those are different things. But that's how our, that's how David Hanky are the one who founded the ministry back in the late seventies. He deliberately chose watch man to counter the watch tower. Interesting. It was David's outreach to JWs that started watch man back in the 1970s. Wow. That's been around for awhile. So that's excellent. And as, as we were getting ready to unpack on these episodes, the, some of the kind of, you know, it's kind of good that we're talking about things that go viral. And so something that has gone viral enough that I've had several people come talk to me about it, just at church settings and other places, people just stopping is the recent interactions that Wes Huff has had with a couple of different people first in a, in a semi debate format. And we can even talk about that in a minute, the idea of official debates versus the kind of modern day podcast debate, which I'm not a huge fan of, but and then, and then also when Wes Huff was then because of the followup and the fallout and the kind of train wreck that that turned into ended up getting on one of the top, if not the top podcast in the world right now. Joe Rogan's podcast. I was sharing with Ginger. My wife, as some time last couple of days, the power of someone like a Joe Rogan's podcast where you have, where you'll have, you know, CNN will have right now, their numbers are way up right now after Trump got elected up to 1.7 million people. You know, Fox news is a 2.5 million people. The average for Joe Rogan is 11 million people. And so the idea of the new media is almost a misnomer. It's like, no, no, the old media is bordering on obsolete name media now. And so, and so obviously it's a big deal when you have a Christian apologist who knows what they're doing, get that type of platform, but there's consequences with that. Good and bad. And so I thought we would just, you know, we can't go through everything because it's a, the debate was an hour and then the Joe Rogan was three or something. So just to some of the highlights on what we thought when we're talking with whether we're engaging with our own doubts and insecurities and when we're deconstructing or, or when we're dealing with other people who are deconstructing their faith, what are some lessons that we can pick up from it? What stood out from us for us as like, okay, this, that was great. Like this was great. Or, or how do I, you know, cause I'm not working on my PhD in ancient manuscripts. How do I answer questions when people start throwing around Mesopotamian terms and how, how am I supposed to respond? So I think there's just a lot for us to unpack with this. So anyway, that's what I'd love for us to do, not diving into the weeds, but, but kind of generally engaging with some of the high points and low points. And let's start with the Carson debate, which I have publicly actually said a couple of times now, like was, I thought humiliating, honestly, borderline humiliating for Carson. I think Joe Rogan said the same thing about it. Yeah. That's apparently his opinion was also one of humiliation, like trying to get a restraining order or, or like a kind of a gag. Right. I didn't, I didn't look, I was surprised to discover some of that stuff that he had actually gone through legal routes to try to keep that from being published. So you, Dan, you probably saw some of that. What's your, what's your read on that part of it? And then, well, to establish for people that don't know, Billy Carson is an internet personality, right? Who has basically recycled a couple of things that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. So in the 1960s, late 1960s, Eric Von Downigen published Chariots of the Gods and started the whole UFO ancient aliens thing that you see on the history channel. And Von Daniken went on to write like 30 more books on the subject. And then in the 1970s, mid 1970s, I think his name's Robert Temple. I want to fact check me on that. He wrote a book called the mystery of Sirius in 1976, I think it was, which continued and sort of amplified on the heels of Von Daniken the idea of ancient aliens who lived within a triple star system of Sirius. And so Carson has kind of taken that, repackaged it for a generation. What alphabet letter are we on now? Generation Z. We're back to beta saying. I don't know. Do double letters or something. But he has been successful for about a decade or more in promulgating. Which is, that's wild to me. Same kind of Von Daniken temple ideas about ancient aliens and a combinatorial sense of Gnosticism, secret knowledge, magic, witchcraft, temples, astrology, every, every bad thing that you could think of in trying to make crock pot soup. You know, he's kind of thrown it together. And as, and he's, you know, to his credit, he's, he's very eloquent and interesting and entertaining, as Joe Rogan said, when he was talking to Westhoff. It was fun to listen to Billy. And so that's kind of Billy's background. Now it's one of those things where you, I don't know Billy. And I think, does this man really believe these things? Right. Or does he know they're false and he's just riding the wave of kind of a social media thing. I leave that question for somebody else to answer, but I certainly would say based on his interaction with West that he, or his social media, that he really does believe these things, but had never encountered anybody that had really solidly offered any objections to what he was saying, especially about the Bible. So in that capacity, I think it's important to understand that as we work at Watchman, that there's a lot of intellectual characteristics that Carson exhibits that are similar to people who begin cults. So he's not even a serious materialists, atheist. I mean, we're not dealing with that. He believes in God. In the debate with Hough, he told Mark Menard, their host, he says, I believe in a creator God, but he's absolutely opposed to the idea of it being the biblical God. Right. So he's spiritual, not religious, didn't really get into what kind of God he believes in. But a theist self-proclaimed, but his ideas are just, as Wes said, a superficial cursory Google search on a Wikipedia can pull apart some of these things. It's like, it reminds me of the, I'm sure you know the great James Randi, but it reminds me of kind of like when that era when there was this weird mixture of these televangelist healing Christian con artists, and at the same time, the psychic movement and the psychic friends network, and it was just exploding in America. And it was all so ridiculous. And yet millions of people were buying into it. Well, there's a center out in the San Bernardino, out in the Yucca Valley area, the Integratron, which was a place that it and it's a structure where they believe that back when it was built, I think in the 50s or 60s, that you could somehow channel aliens or contact higher powers through this particular spot on the planet. But you're right. To your point, Chris, the idea of UFOs parallel a lot of this stuff that was growing up in the 50s and the 60s, new age mysticism, televangelism wasn't helping anything. And so Carson has just kind of repackaged all that for a new generation of people. Can I ask a quick clarifying question? Because I know that your work kind of delves into some cults and stuff like that. Would you mind just unpacking for a minute what you mean by kind of exhibiting some of the intellectual characteristics of a cult leader and what you look for in that? Absolutely. We have watched them do a program called the marks of a cult. And we use a simple analogy with mathematical symbols at addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. And one of the chief things that I heard, now this is the first time I'd ever heard of Carson myself until just a couple of months ago when I found out about this. The big one that he does, so I'll start with subtraction. He takes away from the divinity of Christ. I mean, if you're going to be a cult leader, you have to have some, and it's interesting too, because most every mainline religion or cult has something to say about Jesus. And it subtracts, usually they have to denigrate who Christ is. And so that's one of the things that Billy did. Now, I think he believes that Jesus existed, but he was some being that attained higher consciousness or something. But it's a subtraction of Jesus' divinity. And the other thing that we do, so they add requirements for salvation. They divide followers' loyalty. They subtract from the divinity of Christ and the way they multiply requirements for salvation and they add to the Word of God. And so in some sense, and too real from the videos that I've seen of him so far, he's added to the Word of God, which is what a lot of... It's not just cults, but atheism, and a lot of people will add things. Even biblical higher criticism is a constant continuing adding to the Word of God in order to denigrate the Word of God. And then I saw specifically in the video with Wes denigrating Christ's divine nature, talking about confusing Christ's nature, which was all about what the early century heresies were in relation to the nature of who Jesus was. But if you're developing a cult, you almost have to. If you're going to acknowledge Jesus was a person, then the next step for you to have any authority in what you're about to create, you would have to absorb him into your doctrine. You either are Jesus in some way or you know who Jesus really was, or you have the inside track to how to be like Jesus or to develop Christ consciousness. I think he said something like that on the video. Well, that was what was sad to me, I think was, and not to jump ahead, but as compelling as Wes's conversation with Rogan was that the almost the last thing out of Rogan's mouth as Wes stepped into the, okay, what do you do with Jesus conversation? You could tell Joe kind of immediately catfished his way back out of that. He was crawfishing, he was like, this crawfish is what I mean. He's rockets backwards and is like, or maybe we all have Jesus powers in us. And anyway, that's the end of our show. And you're like, oh, wow. That was a, like, you just heard someone so powerfully, clearly, intellectually dismantle all the other options. And yet, well, maybe all the other options are still on the table. Okay. That's the end of our show. We're not going to jump to that, but that was a, that reminded me so much of, and I have some of these old cult books on my shelf here, but it's like how often people had these, these, and some of them, again, like we said, sometimes people are caught up in this stuff very honestly. And I remember distinctly watching Randy James, Randy do his, you know, 10,000 at that time was a $10,000 challenge, which was an unthinkable amount of money for someone to win on a show. And, and, and all you had to do was pass any, any psychic could pass any one of his tests would immediately get that check. And some of them were like, there was a sweet old farmer who was a dowel rod guy. Like he found wells for people. He had a little rod and he would, and so Randy just put him out on the walkway with buckets of water. Some had water in him. Some didn't under him. And like, this should be real simple. Just tell us which buckets have water, which ones don't. And I mean, the old guy was clearly completely authentic. Like there was no, nothing malevolent in this portal guy at all. And he just totally bombed, of course. And afterwards was like, wow. I mean, just stunned that he bombed. Like he was so caught off guard when it didn't work. And, and, and even the, the interviewer with Randy afterwards was like, yeah, those aren't fun. Like I feel bad about those. But then you had others that were clear con artists who they'd learned tricks and Randy had seen how to knew how to prevent their tricks. And they were just busted on national TV for not, you know, the Yuri Gellers and whatever of the world just got busted. But that's, that's what's wild to me is we are so desperate as a race to find any answer, I guess, other than one that requires submission on our part to a savior that we will make create the biggest, it's like throwing jello on the wall. I mean, yeah, I guess that's entertaining too, but it's not really valuable. So I was, I was very surprised that, that someone like Carson thought he could be in a conversation. And I guess that's just the echo chamber effect is he's only been surrounded mostly probably by people who agree with him. And I mean, we've seen that happen with a lot of atheist debates is when they, that's why none of them will talk to Dr. Craig anymore or whatever in official debates, because it's to get go so badly for them. And I think too, that the one thing I've not heard in all the stuff I've been watching surrounding this to your, what you had just said, Chris, as I've been working for Watchmen for the last five years, if there's one thing I've learned and you know, you, you, you get into this and you start to see all the strange beliefs that people have. And you really start to study them. It's very easy to, to make fun of them. Like, how could people, right? How could people believe this stuff? And then you, you have to check, like James said, because my boss is a former fourth generation elderly and he's, he's been very good at helping me understand that when you go talk to these people, you, you, we are literally training people to ruin people's lives. That's right. And we're pulling out the entire foundation, maybe starting with a small stone, but, but, but, and so I started to wonder, I'm like, okay, I got to stop making fun of people. Yes. And what they believe is still an ever present temptation. But then, and I think that's, that's the point. I think but then the second thing was, how come I'm not like that? I'm, I'm, I'm one, one dumb decision or whatever, one moment of weakness. And I'm suddenly intrigued by somebody like a Carson, right? But that's how it started for him. I'm sure if you go back to Billy's childhood somewhere at some point, whether it was trauma or whatever, that, that entrance into that way of life is this is something that we're all susceptible to. And it's not only just by the grace of God. So the one thing that I never saw, I watched atheist responses to Wes video. I watched Christian responses. I watched Wes's responses. And I'm sure Wes would agree with what I'm about to say, but I didn't see it in social media. And it's simply this, Hey, Billy, Jesus loves you. You know, I mean, everybody's like, the Christians are high five and everybody, we beat this guy. Atheists are even going way to go Wes for, for, for rubbing this guy's nose in his own nonsense. Right. And then it's clear in the video that Billy's just done. Right. Right. And how many of us have had that moment in our own personal lives? Yeah. Our humiliation with a friend job. Didn't make it on YouTube. Last year I talked to a Neil Shenvy. I don't know if you know who Neil Shenvy is. He's an author. He was really big on helping Christians understand critical race, but Neil has this thought experiment. He said, what if you had a, in the state and age of devices, we had a device attached to us that would blurt out in public. We couldn't take it off like an ankle bracelet, right? Just blurred out in public. All of our secret thoughts as they're happening. Would you go to church? Would you go to Bible study? Would you go to the grocery store? You know, and, and the, his point being is that we can instantly know in that thought experiment that we're all a wretch. And so, so the idea is that if, if Billy is hurting and this is the lowest point in his life, maybe it is. Yeah. Would, would we welcome him into our church? Would we love him? Would we care for him? And it just seemed like everybody was just like cheering for this man's demise. And I'm, you know, the Bible talks about this demolishing strongholds, which yes, I think Wes did a fantastic job of doing that. But there's also the necessity of, of, of speaking the truth in love with reverence and gentleness, which I think he did. That's what, yeah, I felt like he was super respectful. I think he did. I think, yeah. And so what I, like I said, I think he would agree with what I just said, but I don't, I don't see that coming from, you know, the, the, the sort of the Christian social media, everybody's making their little clips about how, right. We, we defeated Billy Carson, but to your point about what he said, it's not, it's not hard to, to take those ideas if you, if you understand your faith seriously. So it's not a matter of having facts on your side, right? It's a matter of having love on your side that, that I look at apologetics like describing a box of macaroni and cheese on the grocery store shelf. Okay. I can, I can explain to you all the facts. I can tell you how to make it. But that's not going to make you want to eat it. What do I have to do? I have to make the macaroni and cheese. So when we talk about apologetics without love, we're just talking about dry box macaroni on the shelf. Right. Nothing wrong with that. But we got done. It's not done. I have to, I have to present it in a way that you want to eat this. Yeah. And I think what Wes did was he talked about the macaroni and he made the cheese and he made it and people wanted to eat. Yeah. I want what he's having, you know, and that's, that's what apologetics should be doing. And it should make, and you know, maybe Billy will come back to Wes at some point, but you want to be, if you, if you undo somebody's worldview, you want to be the person that they come back to, not the person they run away from. Yeah. Conversion is by definition, a total change of identity. You're wiping everything off, including your foundations and challenges. I'm going to start over, which is why it's so rare for adults to do it. It's so hard for us to truly convert. Very difficult. And that's the other thing is that we, we should as adults who have some life experience, recognize just the kind of intellectual, uh, embarrassment, the kind of stuff that he went through. Yeah. Billy did and just have a, just have some kind of, like I was watching a group of Christians this morning critiquing the video laughing at Carson. And I'm like, if I'm at, you know, when I'm on YouTube, I have some embarrassing moments on YouTube when I started off in apologetics, even David show, it wasn't the greatest, uh, paragon. Well, that's one of the things actually that I remember from our last interview with you was you were, you were saying like nothing makes you want to prepare more than going on an interview and just getting demolished. I was like, that is a, a very humble, a very realistic theme. And so, sorry, I interrupted you. No, that's, that's exactly where I'm at. And I don't, I definitely don't have the, I'm going to demolish you attitude because it's just, it doesn't, it's not, it's not productive. Um, but I, I didn't, I just wanted to say that I'm not defending what Carson believes. Right. Um, just like who's, who's in his court if he needs Jesus. And also, I think, go ahead. Well, I was going to say, I think those, all the things that you mentioned are tied together of like presenting something in love. You have to see them as a person who has a story. So it doesn't matter how crazy of a thing he believes. Like I think it is easy to make fun of, especially the more preposterous we view the belief, um, or more, even if we feel like there's no reason that they believe it, like they don't have good logic behind it or good reasons or research on their own, whatever it is. Like there are instances where it's easier to make fun of people. But like you're saying, if you view them as like, Billy Carson has a story, he has his own trauma. He has his own reasons that he's gotten to that place. I think that equips us and then viewing ourselves in that humility of like, man, I, you know, all the things that you just mentioned about how we view ourselves. I think that combo helps a lot when it comes to like loving people and not just viewing them as, as a battle to win. Right. Because atheists, uh, nothing hit home to me more succinctly than when we started reaching, when I started at Watchmen started reaching out to Latter-day Saints, you know, the big caution was don't, don't mock these people, you know, and then recognizing that my attitude toward their beliefs was just like atheists attitude toward my beliefs. Right. Yeah. And so, okay. Even I talked to a lot of cosmologists too in our podcasts and they believe a lot of strange things and they think they have the science to back it up. But even though most people can't follow the mathematics, but the point is, is that we all hold to worldviews that other people think are insane. Right. So it's not like any of us have an epistemic position where we can mock anybody. We're just, nobody's in that position. Even though we do that, nobody has the purview of like, the world is really strange. And who's to say? I mean, you know, the strangeness doesn't mean that something's necessarily false. Totally. And we have to give our interlocutors that grace and we have to give it to ourselves and we have to at least, but until I think, until you're humiliated or until you suffer a little bit, I think it's, it's, it's, your apologetic is going, I mean, and Jesus uses it all. He does for his glory. But I think some of the best apologetics has been tempered with suffering to some degree. And Wes has his story about how he suffered as a kid and what got him the miracle of his paralysis. So I think from the get-go, Wes has had some life experience that has humbled him because he didn't show, you know, he's going to walk again. I actually think part of why these went viral among Christians is, you know, it, you know, we were obviously, we're talking about the passage, the apologetics, you know, passage, the tattoo passage for apologist, but the in your heart's honor, Christ, the Lord is holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, you do a gentleness and respect, having a good conscience so that when they, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. So you see that the apostle Peter, who probably, you know, lent himself towards, you know, wanting to, at some point you would think the high priest zero. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The servant of the high priest smacked his ear right off. And so yeah, exactly. A little attention deficit and maybe some impulse control, but he, he reminded us do it, that it's just as much having the answers and the way you communicate the answers is a powerful integration. Here's what I think is wild. Is it still in this day? I think what blew most of the people who have talked to me about it was not isn't, it isn't that West was respectful and I mean, you just seem struggling. Like how do I answer this in a, in a way that's not going to be insulting? Like, okay, what you just described something in a book that's not in that book. Like it's not there at all. Like none of what you just said, you're 15 minute monologue includes essentially nothing that's in that doc ancient document. How do I say that without calling you an idiot? I mean, how do I, like you see him struggle. I think what blew the people away who came and at least talked to me about it was that he had an answer that, that he was able to calmly go, okay, but that's, that's not right. Or, or I think if you looked again, Billy, you'd see that that's not there or not just his attitude, but I think still in this day and age, it's surprising to a lot of evangelical Christians that we aren't stumped by these types of things. I think they still live in a world where atheism has some type of intellectual upper hand and we're just having to do the Mark Twain faith is believing what you know, ain't so thing. And, and I still think that's the case. I still think they expect the Christian to get asked a question and the Christian, even the expert to go, wow, I, I've never heard of what you're talking about. That's shocking to me. Like, no, no, no one's ever, you've just, they think that that's what's going to happen. The same thing that the debater thinks is going to happen. The atheist, or in this case, Billy Carson, the thinks is going to happen, which is the Christian is going to go, Oh, what could you, could you tell me the name of that book again, that Babylonian ancient document, and instead to have West go, well, but no, the, the version of whatever language, and again, now I'm paraphrasing because I'm not, that's not an area of my expertise is mean that he knew this such detail. The answer to that. I just, I just think Christians are still surprised when they learn what we try to teach the students starting in student age here. It may be a new question to you, but it's not a new question. Right. Maybe you've never heard it before. You don't have an answer to it, but I promise you someone does. And, and that's was so comforting to me over the years when I get hit with a question that, you know, quote, stumps me to go, wow, that's, that's a great question. I'm going to research that. Thank you for giving me that, you know, trail to run down. Yeah. And then I'd search it, look up for it and discover like, Oh yeah, this is something that the, the Puritans had dealt with or, or that, you know, send Augustin had written two books about, and you're like, Oh, so we didn't just come up with this then. So yeah, I just think that's fascinating. Yeah. And I think the, the thing to remind everybody, first Wes is a PhD student in, in this area, in, in textual, in, in old texts from the Bible, both the old and the new Testament. So he's, he's, this is what he lives and breathes our scholarly approaches to, to documents. So he could, he had on the top of his head, the gospel of Barnabas and the Codex Sinaiticus. And the codices, it's interesting too, because this is just a factoid that I knew that, that the, when you see manuscripts of Greek, especially the new Testament there, they have both sides on them. It's a Christian manuscript because the codices was a book Christians were writing on both sides of the papyri, but largely for expenses because papyri was not cheap. And, and it, the, the, I think Wes mentioned a P52, which was discovered in the 1940s in Egypt. And Wes has a sort of a 20 minute video on can we trust the Bible? But in that video, and you know, just common knowledge is that, that a lot of the textual manuscripts that we have come from Egypt. Why? Because that's where the paper was made. Right. Because there's lots of, and, and, but just stuff like that, it's not, you don't have to be a scholar to know these little things. Right. And, you know, make part of your, as a Christian, if you're overwhelmed by, or afraid of like, maybe my atheist friends can ask me a hard question. I don't know. Will you just make apologetics part of your devotional study or whatever? Right. I mean, if we have three hours to watch a football game, we got three hours to watch, to, to study and show ourselves approved. I think that's a scriptural to, to, to study, to show ourselves approved. Now it doesn't mean you're going to have to be put in on Joe Rogan or, right. But, but you will have people, God will equip you. And there's that verse in scripture where Jesus says, speak on the rooftops. What I tell you in the house speak, what I tell you in the darkness, speak into the light. Right. So the idea is that God gives us stuff to present to people where God places us. So God has given us all information and knowledge to be able to share with people. And that's just the thing. It's, it's our, our faith is a share faith. There's nothing secretive about it. You don't have to be a specialized guru, but we all have the responsibility to know what we believe and why we believe it. And you don't have to be an apologist. You don't have to be a scholar, but you do have to be prepared to give a defense. And, but, but to your point, Chris, which you said, if you don't know something and just, and you have a relationship with someone, yeah, that within the context of that relationship, you can have an ongoing conversation about things where you give each other the grace to look up stuff that you bring up in a conversation. Right. And I think one of the things that Huff's success has pointed out to me, or refined to me is the idea that, that conversation is evangelism. Yeah. Right. It's not a method. It's not a technique. It's not any magic sauce. Uh, your conversations are evangelism, especially if people are asking you questions. So you don't have to be super knowledgeable, like a PhD scholar, but I think, to your point, Wes's success, if you will, on, on Rogan, um, should light a fire under all of us that we should, we can all have that ability to give an answer to people that, um, ask us questions because we serve a pretty amazing God. Oh, totally. Absolutely. Go ahead. No, no, I was just going to say before we, cause I know there, there are aspects of kind of the Rogan interview that we'd like to talk about. Um, before that, what were you going to say? So I think practically speaking, if someone is, um, maybe they're challenged by this of like, wow, I need to do a better job of this as a believer. I'm not going to be a PhD student in manuscript. I forget what his actual degree is, but, um, and I think, I think, um, he does a good job of saying, well, I'm not an expert in that. Or this is my field, but, but he still has a general knowledge to have those conversations. So if someone wants to do a better job of being equipped, do you think those are good places to start of like either for sure, answer your own questions, dig into things you're interested in, and then go through like the conversations and the relationships that you have right now and be equipped for those specifically? Like, is that a good place for people to start? Because I think it can be overwhelming when you hear a PhD, um, student or not student, but someone with a PhD to get overwhelmed and just give up now and say, I, there's no way I could ever. So practically speaking, where do people start to be more educated, better equipped for these conversations? If they feel like I'm just doing my life. Well, you know, in our day and age, we live in a, we swim in an age of information, but just think of the own conversations that you have with people every day. What are people talking about? Super Bowl, Taylor Swift, whatever, you know, but people know this stuff intimately. People can talk at length about how the Eagles contained Patrick Mahomes last night. Um, they can talk at length about their favorite sports teams. They can talk at length about things that they are interested in. For me, I can say in, in the professional field of apologetics, I understand that anxiety quite well, because even a little bit more so people ask me more questions because they think I know more. And in a general sense, I know a lot, but I think everybody is equipped to know things differently. So, you know, Wes is Wes and God's got Wes doing what God has Wes doing. But the idea is what, what, what, what are we passionate about? Right? Patrick Mahomes or the, and I'm not saying you can't love football or whatever, but we will talk about nature. Like Joe Rogan said to Wes Huff on the, during the conversation, I want to have conversations about stuff where you can wake me up at four o'clock in the morning and I can tell you all about it. Right. And he's right. Yeah, for sure. And that's what, I mean, I, we all fall short of it, but that's where we ought to be as Christians is living and breathing. What motivates us, you know, to be able to be woken up at four o'clock and explain the gospel to somebody in a winsome manner. So to your point, I think it there's a, there's a parallel track of developing relationships within your church community, obviously, but not remaining in that bubble. And, and to the level that you're comfortable with, there's plenty of information out there. I mean, we have a website, there's books, I can recommend all kinds of things, but to be honest, if you, if you, if you want to know more about Patrick Mahomes, you know exactly what you got to do. Yeah. Right. You'll find it. You'll, you'll find out how to do it. And to some extent, I think with apologetics and giving it a defense for the hope that is in us, generally what I find to be the case is that God will put you in the hot seat and make you feel, make you squirm a little bit. That's happened to me many times. Now, what are you going to do with that? I mean, God's not up there yelling at you, telling you, but I, we just interviewed a lady who was a former Muslim who in her conversion, she felt like God was leading her to read stuff about Islam and Christianity. So I think prayer, you know, Lord, if you're motivated by this, you'll find the venues and there's so many different venues. I could, I don't want to, but not want to limit it. But I think the Holy Spirit lighting that fire within you. And, and if this interview with, with Wes Huff has lit a fire, there's a multitude of different ways that you can pursue it, but God will be leading you in that capacity. And I think, so I think it's, I hate to oversimplify it, but I think the answer to the question would be, will be kind of self-evident. If it's something that you enjoy, something that you want to do, you'll find that it will be brought to you. It will more like, it will just come to you. Like, this, it's kind of what happened to me. I was scared, nervous. When I first became a Christian, how am I going to answer all these questions about God? I don't know anything about God. I'm a Christian now. And so I was on a lifelong quest to understand what, what these questions might be. And God continually put me in situations and made these things available to me. And now I'm scared because God's given me a lot of stuff over the years. I've been required hundreds of people over the years at Watchmen. And, and I'm like, Lord, and I turned, so much so I turned down a PhD scholarship last year because I'm overwhelmed with what I'm learning at work. And I'm not, I'm not putting into practice what I'm learning at work, let alone add a degree to it. Now, could I have used that piece of paper for something else? Yes. But part of me wanted to keep his foot in, in the blue collar world. Yeah. I think to some degree, I'm not saying it's wrong to get a doctorate at all. I'm just saying for me, the calling that God has on me, I felt like remaining in the blue collar world would mean not getting a doctorate. Well, my, my dad who has one, although he regrets telling me this now at one point, made it clear if you can be happy and fulfilled in life without a PhD, then have that life. And, and so I've managed to pull that off. I now have gotten well into life without one. And so, I didn't really answer your question, but I think, I think if it's important to you and it's, it's a concern of yours, not you, but anybody, sure. There's plenty of resources, but I think finally it has to begin with, well, how does anybody even become a Christian? This Holy Spirit is working to move you into these conversations. So if you're at all even listening to this, or if you've listened to Rogan and you've listened to Rogan and Huff, and if you've been involved in the West Huff thing, what is, ask yourself, what is God asking you? What is, what is, what is, not so much of what he's asking you to do, but what is he leading you toward? If all of this stuff is really super interesting to you. Well, but I think you didn't, I mean, in my mind you did answer the question because it goes back to like, what do you love? So it goes back to your priorities of, okay, if you have a, a love of the, we're hating on the Superbowl right now, but if you have a love for the chiefs or the Eagles, but a knowledge of Jesus, like you're going to spend your time pursuing what that, that love leads you to do. And so I think you did answer in my mind of, like, if you have an interest and a desire to know more, which for a lot of us, we may have to start earlier than that of like, okay, do I have a love for these things? And is my heart drawn to spend my time on it? Because I'm spending my time with something. And I was surprised to see, I was at the gym when I was watching, I didn't sit down and watch the whole game, but the, he gets us advertisement campaign came on. I didn't know they were still doing that. So he gets us. And then immediately I thought, I don't know where is it, where did, where it is in the scripture, but Jesus doesn't get us. He owns us. Right. Right. You know? And I think that may be kind of a way to put the difference here that, do you think of Jesus as just some kind of buddy who gets you or is he, is he sovereign over the universe and your Lord and are you submitting to him? And does he own you? And those don't obviously those, well, I don't love the word buddy, but one of the things we have to be careful about what those aren't contradictory. He is friend. He is a friend. He calls a friend. Yeah. And so, and he is the Lord of the universe. Like, that's, I mean, I always like being friends with powerful, influential people. That's always nice. And so, um, he's the ultimate expression of that. And so how do we, how do we again, continue to present? There's never anything flippant. There should be nothing flippant in our relationship with him. I don't mean it to mean the advertisement campaign. It's just, it's just a way to distinguish is our faith on TV or is it, is it in us? You know, are we living in a social media world or are we, I mean, that's one of the reasons I came out to y'all. Because I feel like it's more important to have these conversations in person whenever I can. Yeah. Um, and I'm always on the screen with people doing interviews. Totally. And I, I've said many times, I said, cause I talked to atheists a lot and I, and I'm, I've got an in-person atheist book club. I'm, I'm attending Wednesday. Um, I've been a part of that for a year on and off, but, uh, that being in person when I did both of my interviews with David Smalley was in person, came here in person to talk. Yeah. And so I, you know, it's hard for us to be everywhere and social media kind of gives us that quasi omnipotence or omniscience, right? But, but I think it's much more effective to be, well, the conversations that happen before and after the actual conversation and debate or sometimes, and I think probably the biggest impact we had on David was when we took him and his family to dinner after the entire debate. And I had two meaningful conversations with him after we turned the mic off. Right. And in fact, we had built up such a rapport the first time that before he went, we went live. He's like, Hey man, just be ready for a punch in the face and clicked on the button. But I knew that because I listened to him. Yeah, exactly. But he turned the mic off and he's like, Oh, you did really good, man. Yeah, exactly. Yes. So that was a good show. And so, but there was some, there was some rapport there. And so I think, you know, you gotta love, you gotta love this stuff. Um, you can, I struggle with this one. She got to love people. There's a little meme on the social media, a little kid, a little short. He goes, he's like a toddler. He's like two. He goes, Oh no, people. That's my lifelong problem. But, but you love the Lord, your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, loving neighbors yourself. I mean, what are we back to the two greatest commandments, you know? And it's good. It's not, we're not for the grace of God. And none of us would even be striving toward those things, but the mind and the relationships and loving others, loving Jesus, loving God with everything we got, and then loving other people. So I have a question because one thing that we've unpacked over, um, over the kind of the life of this podcast is the, um, the concept of hermeneutics and the importance of that. And so, can you maybe point out some things that kind of that you can see from a hermeneutics standpoint, from these interviews that were maybe good or just worth, worth noting, especially about, because I think about like when, um, when a Huff is talking to Mark Minard and talking about what the Bible is like, why the Bible was written, those types of things. Can you speak to any of, any of that to where it's like, one, the importance of hermeneutics in that specific conversation, but then also as people are having those conversations, how hermeneutics can continue to help inform. Absolutely. And hermeneutics can be very intimidating. I think, I mean, it was for me, I took a year of language and seminary in, uh, Hebrew and Greek. And, uh, you're always asking yourself the question, do I have the right hermeneutic? Basically, it's just a way of interpreting the text by what, by what strap, by what foundation are we approaching the text of scripture? And, um, so I think what, what West did very intelligently was not only give you a history of the documents, but, but pointed it to Christ. So like in Luke 24, where Jesus is walking on the road to Emmaus with the disciples. And, uh, Luke tells us that beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he spoke to them, the things concerning himself in all the scriptures. So the foundational, I wish you had that. Oh man. What a sermon. I can't believe you didn't read it. No one wrote that down. Oh man. Come on guys. But they were, but we get a hint of why they didn't write it down. They were walking along the road and they were sad. Yeah. You know, so there's where, there's where melancholy causes you to miss out on the sermon notes. Um, but, but, but really, as I, as we said earlier, um, all these cults and other religions have something to say about Jesus. Right. So the hermeneutic of, of scripture, the ultimate one to simplify it for our audience. I mean, hermeneutics, you can buy thousand page books on her. And we have several podcasts about it too. And so it's a very intricate detailed sort of thing as you guys know. But I think there's two things that have to, before we get into the textual arguments about it, there are two things that I think are prerequisite for how do you even begin the question of hermeneutics? And that is Jesus and love because Paul says in first Corinthians, if you don't have love, um, you're just talking about dry macaroni and cheese, right? You don't have any, you can explain all mysteries, but if you don't have love, you know, so, so the idea that, that understanding text is somewhat separate from our devotional life to Jesus, uh, or separate from Jesus or somehow that, that devotional life isn't related to the intellectual side of what we're talking about, that I always approach hermeneutics in terms of, okay, how does this passage point me to Christ? Um, and you can, you can go overboard with that of course, but, uh, if Jesus statement about the old Testament, Moses and all the prophets are true, then there's no reason to think that we couldn't find tinctures of who Christ is in, in throughout the scriptures and that we should, and that we shouldn't like, like with Carson, you know, his, if he does have a, we all have a hermeneutic and Carson's hermeneutics. Sometimes we use hermeneutics to support our pet ideas. We can do that too, you know, and, and, and it's to some, to some degree, the end result of that is ending up where you are with somebody like Billy Carson or, um, young earth versus old earth creationism. If that becomes more important to you, then your whole hermeneutic is related to the age of the universe or, you know, the early Gnostic heresies or the early heresies about the Trinity or about Christ. Um, it was more, more a philosophical personal point of view than it was a view that is trying to honor and glorify Christ. Because what's the role of the Holy Spirit to bring to mind the things that Jesus taught to convict the world of sin and to glorify God. So to glorify Christ specifically to remind us of who Jesus is. And so if the Holy Spirit is functioning, then Christ is the center of your hermeneutic. And if Christ is the center of your hermeneutic, then you're going to love people. But through that process of sanctification, it's not going to be perfect. Um, even Wes had a nine minute video about all the mistakes he made and he said at the end of it, look, I'm perf, I'm not perfect. Don't look to me like I'm perfect, right? I'm not the perfect one. Jesus is the only one that's perfect. Right. Of course. So I think for me, my hermeneutic filter when, before I go deep diving into academic side of things is to understand, am I trying to make Jesus the focal point of this? And am I doing this in love rather than just wanting to argue with somebody? I don't know if that answers your question or not, but that's a simple breakdown of that. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's good. Encouraging people as they have these, um, conversations and as they're doing the research when they're looking up the things they're passionate about, like you were asking, and then that's part of why we have a local church community is when you go, well, I found these four websites and I don't know if they don't agree with you. Like what, what's right here? What's wrong? Who is this? You know, you could find a Billy Carson website when you ask the question. And so that's part of the church community as you go to your church community and you talk to your lay leaders and pastors and have that conversation with them like, and with other leaders and with other believers, like Philip and the Ethiopian, right? Exactly. Who's going to help me understand who's going to help me understand this. And so I think that's healthy part of why we need those communities. So to wrap up on this one, and then what sounds like, well, maybe even do just a whole other one on Joe on the Rogan one, but is, is that whether you're on Joe Rogan and you have 11 million viewers or your conversation with your unbelieving, you know, brother at Thanksgiving, those are all the gospel in action equally. And if the body of Christ modality that Paul teaches us, if he means that for real, then we have, we are part of Wes Huff's conversation with Joe Rogan and he is part of our conversation with our brother or sister or family member. Like those are all integrated, all parts of the body. I want to make sure to emphasize that this stuff goes viral on YouTube. That's not our aim. Right. Exactly. Not, I mean, it's not wrong to go viral on YouTube, but, but don't, I think, and Brandon mentioned it earlier, we can be overwhelmed by the success of Christians. I am not like that person, Susie so-and-so or John so-and-so or pastor so-and-so. If I was, if I could only be half the person that they are and we look at each other and each other's ministries that God has equipped us with, but I love Paul's analogy of the body. The hand can't say to the eye. I don't need you. The body is a wonderful analogy because it needs all the parts to function. The heart needs, the eyes need the heart and the feet need the heart and the lungs and it all is a working organism together. And that's, so your part may be unseen. And I think even Paul says something about the parts that are unseen, having more of an importance than the parts that are to some degree. I don't know the exact wording there, but that, that don't make social media and the success of other Christians your aim. Don't think you have to talk to an atheist like I've talked to Carson. That's a mistake I make. I want to be like that guy. I want to be the answer man who can just spout off in 24 hours notice. I can just rattle off stuff about the New Testament and about all that stuff. I would have needed much more time to prepare to talk to Billy because I didn't know anything about him, but you know, some of the stuff that he brought up, I had to look it up, you know? So don't be ashamed to say, I don't know, but constantly strive to make sure that, that, that you, you are in accord with God preparing you to give a defense or the hope that is in you. Because it's all by grace that we can open our mouth and say anything anyway. Here we go. Very good. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
