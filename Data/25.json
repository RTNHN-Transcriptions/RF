We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Reconstructed Faith podcast. I'm here in the studio with my partners in crime, Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. And we are talking, kind of unpacking and commenting on the third section or session or whatever you want to call it of the David Smalley interview that we had back in December. And so I'm excited to kind of wrap this up because today we're going to be talking a lot about morality of God's hiddenness. And there'll be some other things kind of interspersed in there. But let me throw it over to Chris Sherrod first. We're kind of talking about... Sorry, I look surprised. That's great. Oh, we're on the podcast. We're talking... Sorry. We're talking about morality and kind of not just the problem of evil, but you know, we've already talked to some about that, but how, you know, as people who talk about, you know, identifying with objective moral truth, but is there moral truth and, you know, am I really... Can I be... I can't even think of the word right now. Okay. Well, we'll talk about it. Yeah. Great. So in the... Sorry also for throwing you off. In the interview with David, I was trying to remember the name of the guy who wrote a book and I looked it up since then. The guy's name is Robert Wright and he wrote a book back in the early 90s called The Moral Animal, Why We Are the Way We Are. And it's all the science of evolutionary psychology. So just a recap real quick. I mentioned in this book, but he basically says in his book that the human mind, for example, like any other organ is designed to... For the purpose of transmitting genes into the next generation. And so when you think of the feelings and thoughts that that creates. So the feeling of hunger is there because it helped keep our ancestors alive and reproduce and take care of their young feelings of lust. And this is what I was going to mention in this story. I mean, in the interview, and that includes sex organs are here because they aided to reproduction directly. And so any ancestors who lacked hunger or sex organs or whatever, they wouldn't have been our ancestors. They would die out. So the idea is they studied the Silverback gorillas in this article they highlight this. And Time Magazine did kind of a summary of this book. And they found that the big giant male Silverbacks that are enormous would have a harem around them. They would gather around them a harem and they would fight off other males to get more females. And the motive was I am trying to survive over and above the other males. And so I'm going to dominate over them and I'm going to have as many females as I can. And that makes it more likely that my genes are going to get into the next generation. So not community thinking at all. It's very selfish. And then the article goes on, or even in the book it goes on and transfers that idea to so why are we as humans unfaithful in our relationships and in marriage and things like that. And his argument was, well, this is leftover from the desire to survive and that the apes were showing. And that's why it happened. That's why we're like that. So when I did that in the conversation with David, he brings up meerkats of how they're thinking of the rest of them. I think he talked about prairie dogs. Oh, prairie dogs. I think it's meerkats. Okay, great. Oh, perfect. Okay, great. So that they will signal the rest of the tribe or whatever and warn them. And so why is that? And you can say a lot of things about, well, David made it that way so that they would survive. But what's interesting in a lot of the claims that he made, because then he said, if a chimpanzee rapes another chimpanzee, the whole group gets mad at him and all those things. He threw out all those claims, basically didn't address what I said with the silverback. But this is where it's one of those, are we going to go, in my brain I'm thinking, are we going to talk about all this and me going, nah, nah, nah, nah. But we just didn't have time, but it's him explaining examples. But I sent Chris this clip not long after that, because I did a real quick research on meerkats. I'm like, okay, so what do we learn about meerkats? Is it valid to say that they're very selfless and noble and this is what led to where our society is today? And one of the things, one of the articles, it cited a 2016 study in the journal Nature and the researchers had looked over a thousand different species of animals and they found that meerkats were the most murderous. Like outright murder, they said about 20% of meerkat deaths are actually murders, what they called murders. Like he just went up and cold-blooded, killed, and then talked about how there's all this territory fighting and stuff. So even with that I'm like, okay, so that's a terrible example. If that's what has led to our morality today and you're holding that up is we should be like meerkats, it's like, no, that's wrong. But then even the idea of where we're saying those are murders means we sense that something shouldn't take place. But then I did a really simple study of chimpanzees and all of these articles just talked about how they are ruthless, they're natural born killers. And Genghis all did all kinds of research and the show, they're not this docile little happy little culture. And some of the articles I read struggled to actually call it rape, but they for sure would talk about sexual harassers, sexual intimidators, like they would totally beat up the females and make sure that they were submitting so that when it's time to mate, they knew like, I better just comply. And so the whole idea that he threw out there that you've actually got these, this code of us watching out for each other is like not true at all. And then you even mentioned, and I didn't even know this, but she said it was well known that like dolphins are some of the worst as far as sexual harassment and forcing... Yeah, a pod of males will gather around a female and not let her escape as they take turns mating with her. And she's no matter what she tries to do to escape, they will batter her back into the center of them. Yeah. And again, I mentioned this in our last thing about your definition of evil, where would that come from if there's no God? In one of these articles I was reading, it was seven adorable animals that are also murderous monsters. It's just funny, but one of the subtitles when they, when they covered dolphins is number one. It says their words were dolphins are unspeakably evil. Wow. That's interesting. That is such an interesting moral language to go, how are you defining evil? Because if science is all we have, and at one point in our discussion with David, he hit his knuckles on the table like, this is how we know stuff, what it's empirical. All science can do is observe it can't make any moral judgments. So you can say this animal, these, these chimps or dolphins forced the female to, and this was the result, she was impregnated, whatever it is, but you can't say that was wrong for them to do. It's just animals being animals. And yet at the same time in this book by Robert Wright, he still implies like, but we don't have to live like these animals. We don't have to, as if there's some morality behind the morality, which you don't have if there's no God. You can't say like, but we can rise above them and be civilized, but it's like, but what if I don't want him? Who says where is any sense of oddness or right, or why do we look at that with dolphins and go, that shouldn't happen. You're just, you're just being an animal. Right. You're talking about rising above and stuff. I'm sorry if I'm cutting you off, Chris shared, but that kind of led into what, what you talked about in, uh, with, with, with David and the addressing like, so you're saying morality is just complexity. Does complexity make us more responsible for what we do? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's so it's like, is that all, and that's what we talked about. Oh no. Have we've done the, well, at the time people hear this podcast, well, they have heard the podcast on intuition that we did last week. That probably to actually may post today. Yeah. Okay. That's what I'm talking about with that is, is the, to assign meaning to it requires something other than just animal behavior to assign moral meaning. So if there isn't a divine presence, if there's not a God, and if there's nothing special or supernatural about us, the only thing that we have an advantage over dolphins or hyenas or whatever is complexity. That's it. And so if it's not immoral when chimpanzees do it, why is it immoral when we do it? Because the only advantage we have is complexity. And so somewhere in David's worldview and in the naturalist worldview, either there is no such thing as morality other than just assigned by humans that we just decide this is moral and immoral. And in fact, when we talk about morality, that's why, I mean, again, this is one of those conversations David and I have had. And I don't, I don't know if he remembers it because he has lots and lots and lots of the same conversations over and over again. But, but the is, is, was me asking about abortion. That's why I went down the conversation of abortion with him when he talked about, well, we can create an objective standard of morality. And it is the combination of the veil of ignorance, along with human flourishing that you put those two things together, what causes human flourishing and doesn't. And then you can decide case by case based on the veil of ignorance. Well, if I don't know what's going to happen and, and that's why I took him again, for me, that was a script like, okay, we had this exact conversation before. So let's unpack the exact conversation. And it wasn't the exact conversation because in the past he would say, yeah, I get what you're saying. That makes it tough. Cause if I was the baby, I don't know if I would want to be aborted or not. But now that now he's got a different answer, which is yes, if I was that baby, I would want to be aborted because apparently I'm not wanted or whatever. If the mother doesn't want me to be alive, then then I wouldn't want to be alive. Yeah. But the problem is that doesn't solve the problem because I wouldn't, if I was the baby, you would want to live, even if it was in an unloved, unloving family, right? And, and I'm not going to call into question what he's saying. Like I'm not going to question him at face value, like whether he's telling the truth or not about what he would actually choose in that moment. Um, uh, I suspect if all of his family came to him now and said, we don't want you, he would not be okay with them taking his life. Um, when he's older and the family says, we don't want you anymore, he probably would not be okay with being killed by them. But so he, so I don't know that he's right about that, that he would be even be telling the truth from his own perspective. But even if he was, that still doesn't create a good standard because I wouldn't. And so who gets to decide whose answer to give mine or David's. And so I would say human flourishing requires us to rescue unborn children, even by his standard of objective, which is not objective morality. Now, he's right that ours isn't objective in one sense as well. We'll get to that in a second. It's objective for humans. It's not objective for God, but it's a, um, uh, or it is objective from God, but for a different reason, we'll, we'll talk about that. But I remember having a lengthy conversation with David about this whole evolution question and I was stunned and I'm always stunned at how poor often humanist understanding of evolution is. And we don't have to spend a lot of time unpacking. We do that another podcast someday, but evolution does not serve a species. It serves an individual and that's not, um, our, I think it's Robert J. Gold. Steven J. Gold. Steven J. Gold. Thank you. Uh, the miss the measure of man or miss measured man. And it is, it's, it is, he isn't actually knows what he's talking about and he, he talks about what evolution actually is. And anytime you ask someone the question like, why do giraffes have long necks and they say to reach the leaves at the top of the trees, that is why did, why that is not, that is teleology, not evolution. Evolution doesn't have the capacity to intentionally lead to a result. And so it just says, listen, if one has an advantage and it can get food easier and therefore have more offspring and like that, it is, it, it, it does not affect it. Usually often evolution is a source for, uh, extinction. It would be the number outside of humans, probably the number one cause for extinction would be evolution. Obviously most creatures have to die out in competition in evolutionary theory. And even we've talked about this topic briefly, or we, I don't know when it's going to get posted, but even the idea of survival of the fittest or natural selection is not inherently atheistic. It's just, it's a fact. Like if you're older or weaker or slower or crippled, you're going to die. Like you're less likely to reproduce. And you can even say that that's God's kind of screening mechanism of making sure that the species is staying strong because of the weaker ones are dying out. It's, it's just, go ahead. You're going to say something. I was going to ask you, so you're talking about that with evolution. How would you address in now that you're able to kind of sit back and think about it rather than in the kind of the tumult of all of the conversation when he talked about evolved compassion within that context? Because it doesn't see, it just seems like when you take into account entropy and also the evolution really is not, it's not the developing some, it's really for the individual. How do you take something where that is very much for someone else or for something else? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how you would address it, but that was just, I was like, huh, I wonder what your thoughts, extended thoughts would be on. Yeah. I think if you're staying faithful to your world, then any feelings or emotions or whatever you have is still genetic wiring. It just evolved that way. And what that means is the difference between mother Teresa and Hitler's morality is the same difference as blue eyes versus brown eyes. Like it just happened that way. Like it's, it's just a cold, hard fact of nature. That's the fundamental distinction between people is just your chromosomal, chromosomal makeup. And when you start saying it that way, people naturally go, nah, it's more than just blue eyes versus brown. Like there's something in it that we just know. And yet if there's no real morality, this is what's interesting. The guy Robert Wright that I keep referring to, he said, since our behavior is determined by our genetic drive to reproduce, here's his quote. He says, it is natural for both men and women. It's sometimes under some circumstances to commit adultery or to sour on a mate or to suddenly find a spouse unattractive, irritating, wholly unreasonable. It is similarly natural to find some attractive colleague superior on all accounts, on all accounts to the story wreck of a spouse you're sound with. But what that means is whatever's natural is simply just what you do. Like anything that happens, it's, that's natural. Right. And if you're doing something that is a statistical anomaly, like pedophilia or rape or whatever, all we can say is, well, most people don't do that. Most people have evolved to say that's wrong, but you can't actually say, no, there's an actual violation of someone as a person that happened. One of those, this is crazy to read, but I hope this isn't too offensive. In one of these articles I was reading, it talks about how seals have now taken up raping penguins. Oh my gosh. Seriously. Like it's like a crazy thing that they don't just eat them, but they actually, because we think of them as these cute little whatever, but in this polar biology, this BBC thing, they're highlighting even that seals are doing this and you're just like, wow, we are repulsed by that. But then you just go, all we can say, if there is no spiritual side of anything and there's no God and we're all just naturalists, all I can do is go, that's just what we observe. Like you can't say that's wrong. That shouldn't happen. So again, compassion. But you're saying that you're saying if all there is is a natural explanation, humans doing that would be the same thing. It's the same. It's just more complex. And it bothers us. And we're, you can say like, you should know better, but it's like, but if I'm really just an animal, why can't I just live like an animal? And people are going to appeal to you, but there's something else civil is like above and beyond behind this morality that if there's no God, evolved along a different line than seals did. Right. So seals, it's okay for seals to do it because they're just seals. They evolved along that line. It's not okay for humans to do it because humans evolved along a different line. And that feels very empty as a moral argument. To answer your question, also, Colson, I can't come up with one. And I went through a long period of time, several years where I studied evolutionary theory, because I don't think evolutionary theory is contradictory to scripture. And so I was really fascinated by it. But secular evolutionary theory is contradictory to scripture and reason. Like I can't, this is one of the examples. You need a source for, for morality. So there's four, four of us guys in the room here. If all four of us have evolved from chimps and we have chimp morality, meaning or, or go further back, you know, whatever it is, we have amoeba morality, we have rat morality. Okay. And one of us, so the four rats in the room, one of us is born with a fluke mutation to care about the other three. Like I now I'm concerned for the three of you, I want to make sure you've got enough food that you get to mate as much as you want, even if it costs me something like, and I have a fluke mutation for that, that you don't have. Okay. Which of us is more likely to get to spread our genes to the next generation? The nice rat who cares about you, or the three sociopath rats who are just rats? How long does the nice rat even survive in that world? So you literally have to have essentially a tribe of people evolving simultaneously, the concept of compassion. And, and that does not seem rational to me. How do you get, it's not enough for an individual. One, the one nice guy had to evolve or girl had to evolve in an otherwise pool of people who had no morality, no concept for right and wrong beyond their own flourishing. Because evolution teaches the individual to flourish. Morality is based on the flourishing of the individual, in particular at the expense of all competitors. And why would I want to help rescue you if I'm endangering my own life? Right. Like why should I show compassion? Especially since you're one of the mean rats. It's exactly. But what that means is, and this is where people I think don't, aren't thinking through what this would, the ramifications. All that would mean is that good and evil, right and wrong, good is literally whatever aids in my survival to pass on my genes to the next generation, which sends the opposite of civilization and kindness and compassion. But that's really all you're left with. Right. And, and even if, even if I, even if the majority of you were nice rats and I decided that I'm going to be the selfish rat, you couldn't say objectively, you really should be nice. We just, we just don't like that you're not nice. We're going to invent a religion to force you. Right. Right. It would just be like, okay, well, that's your opinion. And just cause there's more of you doesn't mean that now all of a sudden, you know, there's some objective thing over all of us. And so it's just still so flimsy to try to base it on. So I want to, I want to do one more example. There's a great story. The ones who walk away from Amelas is a book written years ago, in about the time I was born back in the early 70s by Le Guin and walk away from what walk away from Amelas O M E L A S. Okay. And, and even though I don't remember all the details of the story, because it's been too long, the basic principle is that it is a, there's a summer festival in a utopian city. And the utopian city and the summer festival, the prosperity depends entirely on the perpetual misery of just one child. And so every, everybody gets to have a utopian experience, except the consequence of that utopian experience is there's one child who has to be abandoned, neglected, and periodically abused. And when that's done, the rest of the culture gets to have utopia in, in any objective, in any subjective moral that talks about human flourishing, this would be an easy yes. Now, if David said, what you don't know if you're going to be the one or if you're going to be the all the rest, any of the rest of them, like, right, that would be terrible. But how selfish would you have to be to not be willing to be the one? You know what you're saying? There's something really wrong with you. Like, if I knew that by me being tortured for the rest of my life, every of unelse would have a utopian experience. I'm morally obligated to accept that. And, and so it's a anytime you talk about the additive and negative effect of, of this type of stuff, that's, you end up with this story ends up being the question, is it okay, if it only involves evil, intentional choosing evil for one person, if all the rest of us get to thrive? Animals don't ask that question. There's something inspired in us that asks a question like that. And I don't believe that it's merely complexity. I think there isn't, there's a concept of morality that morality exists. And that there are certain things that we know are complex moral conversations. And yeah, anyway, okay, that's great. Yeah. So, oh, go ahead. Go ahead. One thing I didn't mention, I hadn't heard the now I've heard it a few times, because I looked it up, but the veil of ignorance idea. Yeah. I realized I was like, I think Jesus actually put that in a different way. Just doing the others as you would have them do into you. It's like, that's the simple morality that we should always follow. Yes. So it's not like, because when I heard that, I was like, Oh, okay, so that must be some new idea. And then I went, wait a second. That's what Jesus said. That you just consider others. I'm going to treat you the way I want to be treated. Yes. Yeah. There's okay. That's all over the place. That is a, that is a great example of how to make moral, one of the ways to make moral decisions. Definitely. But we do believe in the divine, uh, morality, meaning that there is still a God who it is though it is somehow quote, subjective is the idea that is subjective from his end. He gets to change his mind and he's not changing his mind. He is applying the truth of morality and justice differently in different situations. Because as we talked about, morality is applied differently in different situations. Um, to lie to the officer about how fast I was going would be immoral to lie to my wife about the surprise party we're planning for her would not be to, to lie. To the Nazis about where the Jews are that you're hidden might not be immoral. And so there, of course it's complex and that's why the application is different. Typically, um, it's not okay to kill every man, woman and child in a fortified city. Gosh, who would know what kind of perspective would you have to have to know when the correct application of justice is to kill somebody and when the correct application of justice is to not kill somebody. Well, you would need a command from someone who has the right perspective, a full perspective that's called divine command theory that, that humans are not capable of making those calls in an objective way. So we need an external source to make that call for us. So yes, there might be times when it would be morally appropriate to wipe out a city full of people, but no human could know when that was in and of themselves. We might have to figure it out in the middle of war or something like that and try to solve it, but we would say, yeah, I don't, I don't want to have to make that call. And when we do make those calls like dropping a bomb on Hiroshima, we spend the rest of human history questioning that decision. Was it right? Was it not? Look at all the doctor and we spend all that time doing that because we essentially made, we played God in a situation which maybe we were right in doing, maybe not. That's why we need a divine command when it comes to these moral decisions, because we, the standard is no, you do not kill innocent, you do not take innocent life. That is the standard under what condition, so that standard is you do not lie under what conditions can I lie? Well, you wouldn't, it would need to be answerable to the divine command when it would be okay. Is there a higher call from that divinity? And that's what I think I tried to explain to him that there's a, you're not being relativistic. You're looking at the situation going, okay, which moral standard is more important than I need to apply right here. So human life being protected is higher in this instance than lying. Along the divine command authority structure. But even we couldn't make that call if there wasn't an authority structure telling us how to prioritize those. Yeah. And it's not, it's not at all the same as like in Islam, there's kind of a blanket statement like you're okay to kill infidels wherever you find them actually. Literally it says that wherever you find them and you can lie and wait for them. You can, you can be deceitful, all those things. So you have specific instances in the Bible where God says, this is what I want you to do. It's not this blanket, like anytime you want to take over a city, you know, or like in a kingdom of heaven. God wills it. God wills it. God wills it. Like this, that's going to be what you say every time. Hey, you now know that reference. I watched that for the first time the other night. Oh, you saw it. Look at that. Yeah, it was really great. Okay, great. Well, okay. So along the same thread of divinity, you know, we've talked about, talked about kind of moral standards and stuff like that. If there are other moral themes that you want addressed, please holler at us, send me an email. But now can we kind of talk a little bit about divine hiddenness? Divine hiddenness. This was intriguing that David brought this up and clearly this is new to him. I've never heard him reference it, but I haven't been following him for the last few years. And, and he, correct me if I'm wrong, this, he said this is like one of the main things that's difficult for him right now. He, he thinks it's the main thing that's difficult for us as Christians. Gotcha. Okay. It's another, it's another spot on the boat that he can, that he, that he's going to be picking to go like, oops, I found another issue for Christians. And, and that is, which I, I think it's a fascinating conversation and I know we don't want to go super long here, but man, what a, what a fascinating idea. The idea is if someone says, what would make you believe? Like, what would it take for you to believe? And David's answer now, which I think is dead, I think is very accurate. I think it's a great conversation is I don't know. And I think that's being honest. I don't think he does know. It's the same answer I give when someone says, what would cause you to not believe? I say, I don't know. It's, that's a psychological state you're talking about. If I got hit hard enough in the head with a hockey stick, that might do it. I might change my psychological, like, I don't know the answer to that question. Now I can give you a list of things that I could say this would, I mean, this would cause me to change my beliefs or this would cause me to change my beliefs, but what would make me become an atheist? I don't know. There's a lot of hurdles to jump. I got to admit it now. And he said, but the answer to his question, he said, I don't know what would cause me to believe. I don't know, but God does know. And so he could put those things in place for me to believe anytime he wanted to. God knows what it would take and God is powerful enough to cause it. So now, essentially, David believing or not is God's responsibility, not David's. Right. And because David doesn't know what it would be, but God does. I mean, and he even referenced, um, Satan. Remember when he was just saying like he knew it, he was like, well, if God showed me, it wouldn't be him removing my free will because Lucifer knew God and still rebelled. Yeah. And still rebelled. So I would be able to then know that he existed and then be able to make my own decision. Right. If I'm, if I'm remember correctly, that's what he said. He could still make the decision to follow him. Right. That's right. Just like Satan did. Now I don't, I don't put David in the same class as Satan. Oh, no, no, sorry. I was not trying to say that. I'm being funny. You didn't say that. He did in the podcast. He said that. And again, it was, it was late for me and my was, I was already in the weary mode and like, we only have, we've already gone two hours and blah, blah, blah. So, um, but yeah, I, that would have been my joke earlier in the night would have been, I don't, gosh, gosh, David, I don't think of you as so equivalent to Satan with this, but I actually mean that as in, I don't know that David or I or us have the same intellectual capacity that Satan does to be convinced of something like a divinity and still rebel against it. Like I don't, I'm not convinced that that is an actual statement. That's true, but it certainly would keep him from being an atheist. He would, he would then certainly know there was a God. And so that's what hit the point he's making. Um, okay. So what were your, what were your thoughts on that one? I think there's a fascinating conversation there. So the answer is easy. If you're a Calvinist, you just go, God made it where you don't believe. There are a lot of examples of God doing miraculous stuff in front of people and they still don't believe. Right. We mentioned Pharaoh already. Um, Judas hanging out with Jesus for three years, the Pharisees watching miracle after miracle in their presence, right. And they're upset that it's just on the wrong day of the week. Right. And you, and you just go, how can you be so um, hardened to that. The, I think that the, putting the, the oneness on God is making even a bolder claim that, um, it's fully God's responsibility, responsibility to reveal himself. Um, sufficient for me, like I have, it has to be this, this, this, and I read Romans one, a couple of weeks ago, that just says actually, according to the Bible, just from creation, right. God is saying you're without excuse. Like you can look at creation and figure out, this is when we talked about the cosmological argument and the words that God uses even there are it's plain to them. God has made it plain to them. Um, they know there's a God there without excuse. So is if, if you're asking, I want him to write a message in the sky that says, David, yeah, I really do exist. That's you could, you'd even call it what the Bible would compare to testing God. Like you're, you're, you're putting God to the test in an unreasonable way, not saying, give me enough. And so I think the response that I would make is there's sufficient evidence. It might not be everything that you want it to be, but I think that his, his statement that if I'm the one who's asleep, I'm fully asleep and you're supposed to wake me up for my show and I'm totally drooling all over the place and out and you don't wake me up. It's your fault. So the analogy I think breaks down when you start to go, but there is an awareness. The Bible says that we have, there's a conscience we talked about that there's a moral awareness. There's evidence around you. You've got a historical record of supernatural stuff happening. You've got Jesus life, death, and resurrection. So you have all of these things in place, right? Not to mention the ones we already mentioned, the cosmological argument, the theological, the fact that the earth is the exact size tilt distance from the sun, all those, like how many more things do you need? And I think it's a, I think it's a cop-out to go, I don't know. I just don't know what would convince me. Cause then it would be like what he said. Well, it could be God writing his name in the sky, but then I could say, oh, but there's just an acid. He actually was quoting Lawrence Krauss who answered that way. And that's where you go. Okay. It just sounds like nothing is going to change your mind and you're not being completely intellectually honest. Right. Like, so what if we brought someone in here and they were crippled and then you, you literally without a doubt saw them. Now they can walk. Right. Would you say, Oh my goodness, I believe, or it'd be well, but there could be some random genetic and you just go, okay. So it just sounds like you're, you're, you're saying ultimately nothing will change my mind. That's to me, that's kind of the way it sounded because I think the asleep versus gotta be woken up. I think it's like he is waking you up, but it's just not the way you want him. You want to be woken up. Right. It's your, once again, you're giving God all types of power and authority and denying his existence simultaneously. And so that's, that's there. I get that. And you're telling him how he has to reveal himself to you. Right. Like he's, like he's obligated to do that any more than he already has. Right. And, and so, you know, and I think you referenced when we were talking with him, there is a little bit of, so if it, you know, he's saying it wouldn't require me him to destroy my free will. But what if, how do you know that? Like, what if it did require him to destroy your free will in order for you to believe, would you want him to do that? Like, would you be okay with that? Would you go, listen, if, if, if the truth is there is a God and I will never believe unless he crushes my free will and turns me in an automaton, then I won't believe. Okay. Do you want him to crush your free will and turn you into an automaton? Well, ironically, if you answer that question, yes, then you probably are willing to believe. If you answer that question, no, then you're not willing to believe. Like it's still the same conversation. I would, for example, if someone asked me that, would you want God to crush your free will and turn you into a robot in order for you to believe? I would go, yes, please. Yes, do that. If that's what it takes for me to believe, do that. I suspect David would say, no, no, I don't, I don't, I don't want to be a robot. I'd rather be free and ignorant than to, you know, whatever. So I don't know that. And we were out of time. There's really no way to ask that. I think that question of divine hiddenness, it is key. And he is right that God would know what it would take. Now I'm not convinced, and this can sound unkindly dubious. And I'm sorry if it does, but he, he, I'm going to take the shot because he hinted at the idea that there might be another atheist in a room other than just him. And he was looking at me at the moment when he said that on the podcast, like there may already be another unbeliever in the room or unbeliever, you know, at the church. In fact, they might be right here in the room and he looked at me. And I just, I think he's probably as motivated to me convert to his side as, as I am to his, but which is not the case at all. I'm definitely a believer, but so I'll take the shot. I'm not convinced that David's not already in the position of Lucifer, meaning he does know it, that this is a rational thing to believe and isn't doing it. And I think that's why you get an analogy like God is like an abusive father. I think it's why you get an analogy like that. I think that reveals that David does believe there is a father. He just doesn't like the way he fathers. And so he has rejected him as a father, not rejected him as an entity that exists, though that's what he says, but has actually rejected him as a father. Now that can be super offensive because I'm telling David what he believes. And I don't mean that's not what I'm actually trying to do. I'm not convinced that's not a possibility though, as well, just like he's not convinced. It's not a possibility. I'm not an atheist in disguise. Here's up here at the church, I think so. But I think, I think we're stuck back to if, if God, if I wanted to be woken up by God the way I wanted to be woken up, that's fine. It means that in therapy, we call that a boundary that I've said, unless you're willing to do this, I'm not going to believe in you. If God has set a boundary, well, I'm not willing to do that for you, then we're stuck. And that is a part of free will. A part of free will is when someone draws a boundary for us and we then have to decide. So am I going to follow through with this or not? And that is part of what this conversation is about. And I don't think that's about divine hiddenness. I think that's about human freedom as much as anything. Could God force David to believe in him? I would say theologically, yes. And any of us is God obligated to force us to believe in him. That doesn't make him God anymore. That makes him our pet and or our maid to wake us up in the morning or our butler who's supposed to wake us up in the morning. And I don't think God as much as God loves us, I don't think he's always willing to take that role in our lives. Anyway, I think it's a great question and I've always thought that's a fascinating question. We had a guy at the church where I was before who said, if I see a miracle, I will believe. And it was a big deal. And he came to church week after week. And at that church, we had a young lady get diagnosed with a real problem with her, her guts. And it was really bad. And and they were very worried about her survival. And they had all this, the doctors did all this stuff. And we prayed for weeks for her and made reports to the church. They brought her in the leaders of the church all laid hands on her and prayed for her. And the next week she started getting better. Suddenly, nothing had worked. Suddenly, she's getting better. And within three weeks, she's well, totally well. And so the pastor sat down with the man and said, Okay, you were there the night we prayed. He came and just to watch us pray over her. Wow, you were there the night we prayed for her, you were there for all the reports and there for all the end. And he said, I just think there's probably another explanation. And so like, okay, well, fair enough that this is between. And so this for us as Christians, when it's us, we continue need to continue to wrestle to reconstruct something. If we need to deconstruct our concept of Father or deconstruct our concept of God, that's fine. And we just need to keep reconstructing something we need to continue to build on that. And so I think divine hiddenness is a fun conversation. And it's a hard conversation. I don't know why God doesn't force people. Yeah. Because I'm not God, I don't know. And he's not told me. And that's not his job to explain himself to me at all. We talked about that. We talked about the putting God on trial conversation, which is tough one. Anyway, what if God has already done what God knows is sufficient for David to believe? And yet David doesn't believe that's, that means God is generous enough to give him that choice. True. Rather than to force it. So that's awesome. There you go. Well, we are really grateful for, for David Smalley. Yes. Coming on. And I know the, there's a lot of themes from this that we'll continue to pick up on. I mean, even from this last session, if you've listened to that, if you haven't, please, please do. Some of this conversation will be a lot more clear. But some of that even has to do with the authority of scripture and stuff like that. So this, we'll have a whole season on the authority of scripture. There's a lot of really great stuff. But yeah, if you have any questions about anything that you listened to, please shoot me an email and yeah, we'll talk to you guys soon. And we'll see you in the next episode.
