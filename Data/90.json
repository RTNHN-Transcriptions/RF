We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to Reconstructed Faith. This is once again your temporary host, Bren Starnes, and I am in studio with Chris Legge. And we have a guest today, Zach Tingle, and we're really excited to hear from him. I'm going to go ahead and throw it over to Chris because Chris has known Zach for a lot longer than I have. So yeah, so Zach was in a program that we've talked about, we've mentioned before, the Forge Program, which is a program that Pine Cove does to help train people for a lifetime of ministry. And I got to be a part of that. And so were several other guests that we've had and several people at the church and whatever. And so Zach is a, I love Zach's thinking processes and the way he engages with things. And I love that. And so I'm one, I'm intrigued to get to hear, I don't know that we've talked specifically about some of these things, I'm intrigued to hear it. But I was just like the other day even, oh, so anyway, so I've known Zach for that many years, seven, eight years, whatever that is. Zach is married, has two, three kids, two of them at the same time. He's got twins. So if he falls asleep during the podcast. How old are they? They turn one here in a couple of weeks. Oh my. Yeah, exactly. So you now have a frame of reference for that. Yes, I have a new appreciation for that. Yeah. I remember when we had little kids and some one of our friends would have twins or something, we'd be like, Oh dear Lord, we have twins in our, in our family enough where when we got pregnant, I was, I was like, Oh Lord, if that's what you want for us, then okay. But I'm scared anyway. Sorry. His three kids. Yes. Three kids. And and so anyway, we've, we've tried to get several different guests of different perspectives, different ways of coming at these questions of reconstruction and deconstruction. And in fact, I was, I thought it was worth mentioning again for people who maybe have jumped in, because I know some people jump in the middle in podcast series and stuff. I am one of those people who does that sometimes a podcast series. And so, so like, Hey, this looks interesting. I'll listen to one of these and like, I'm so lost. Well, that's because you've started the middle, but the, but this, the whole thing that triggered a lot of this was the idea that, that back when, I don't know, a few years ago there was, and it comes and goes, there's little fad movements of deconstruction. And that's when the term deconstruction was had become fairly popularized and you had people deconstructing from, you know, the influencers and church staff members and then pastors and, you know, whatever else. And, and the immediate response, which is so sadly typical of the Christian church world is this reactive, sometimes unthinking response. And there was this immediate demonization on some people's part and not on all. And I remember thinking at the time laughing when there was some guy who had deconstructed very aggressively. And, and I'm seeing all these responses like, Oh, you know, just, just very, just felt inappropriately judgmental. And then one of the people who I really admire, William Lane Craig commenting on his podcast and going, so here's what they've done. I've reached out to them and, and offered to, you know, get some time and just, just, you know, just discuss what is going on with them. And it was like, there you go. Dr. Craig, once again, modeling Christ, not just with his life, not just with his brain, but with his life. And like he didn't demonize the person he said they, they've got some good questions. I think they're all answerable, but I think they're good questions. So anyway, it's, I'd love to hear your thoughts as far as in your life, what deconstruction and reconstruction would even look like and, and what are the anchors? That's one of our themes that we come back to. What are the anchors that hold us strong? And then even how do people engage with, as we're being bombarded with different worldviews and stuff? So there you go. I threw like four things at you at once. You can pause all for them if you want. That's a ton to answer all at once. Yeah, exactly. I'm going to go ahead and start with, I think some of my anchors. Okay. I think they're the things that have my touchstones are the things that I've come back to as I've worked through difficult thoughts and difficult questions. One of my personal foundational anchors, which puts me squarely outside of the post-modernist camp is that at the end of the day, things make sense. Okay. That's good. Yep. You've already, you've already jumped the ship at that point, right? That in some way, eventually things make sense. And that's what finally took me to Christ and has been one of the things that I come back to is when questions cannot be answered easily, and there's a lot of questions out there that can't be answered easily. I believe that there is a sensible answer. Okay. And so honestly, one of my touchstones has been the creation of the universe. The idea of choosing between an eternal God or eternal matter is sort of a no-brainer for me. Okay. Because all observable matter behaves consistently. And one of those things is the premise of entropy or things getting more chaotic. If matter is eternal, the chaos would have run the universe out of existence by now. Because if you draw it back infinitely, eventually the math word is an asymptote, but when the curve eventually gets so flat that you can't tell it's not zero, we would be there because the starting point is infinity behind us. Right. You can't jump up from a bottomless well conversation, right? And so yeah, when I'm confronted with the reality that the universe exists, then it is not sensible to me for that to be an eternal universe, which then puts me into the camp of, well, someone had to create it. And I've heard lots of theories about alien creators or whatever else. And that just to me is pushing the question further back. Yeah, that's right. That just stalls. And then from there beginning to build on, okay, so if I assume that there is a meaningful creator, someone or something that created, what frameworks best explain a creator. So I have to land in some sort of theist camp. And of those, frankly, Christianity is the most sensible. I spent some time in high school diving deeply into Islam and a few of the Christianity spinoffs, Hinduism, and I can't get past some of the rational hurdles that those faiths require. There are the fewest of those in Christianity. There are still some tough rational hurdles, as you all have talked through on this podcast, but they are the fewest and the easiest dealt with in Christianity. So that's been one of my... And you think that's better than like atheists or better than there being no God at all. Oh my gosh, the rational hurdles for an atheist are astronomical. Okay. Yeah. To start with the existence of the universe, like that to me pretty much rules out atheism. Okay. Agnostic, I have a ton of sympathy for agnostics because I think in their own brains, they are being honest, is the reality that it is really hard to know things. I think you'll have briefly touched on epistemology. We have, yeah. And so the structure of what is known and what can be known is hard. And for someone who doesn't wanna spend the pretty deep emotional intellectual energy to get through the questions of what can be known, choosing to stand in an agnostic place is intellectually honest at least. Good point. Now I don't think it should stop there. I don't believe that. Yeah. I think we should continue to seek truth and to seek to understand the world we're in and the people we're around and to have good answers for the why questions around that. But for someone who doesn't wanna do that, I would say they're being a little bit lazy, but they're also being honest to say, a agnostic. So then I think the next question was like, where deconstruction and reconstruction has played a part in your life? Was that your question? Yeah, that's one. So I'm gonna come back to, I believe that there are sensible answers in the world. And so that assumption pretty much demands some kind of reconstruction always. When I find something that is not sensible or that conflicts with an assumption I have, that means I have to deconstruct something. I either have to invalidate the objection that's been made to something I believe. Or I have to invalidate the belief. Something has to break. Right. And I'd like to think that I usually am willing to challenge my own beliefs. There are things that I hold pretty dearly that that's hard for me. But when that happens, I believe that it is worth my time to rebuild afterwards. And so, because again, I want the world to make sense. I need an explanation. I don't deal well. I think I have heard Chris say a few times that he thrives in the mystery. I don't deal well with that. And the I don't knows, I want to have an answer. And even if it is an answer of, this is what I believe now and can hold it loosely, there are several things in Christianity that's the case. Some broad strokes like the problem of evil or suffering. I know what I think now, and I know how that fits into my broader picture of humanity and God. But that's also something I hold very loosely because it's hard. And there's a lot about it that I don't totally understand. But I can make sense of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. It does. It does. So that's happened a few times in my life. The first time I was in high school, I was raised in a Christian home. I have wonderful believing parents who at the time didn't dive deeply into theology. They have since become deep theologians, each in their own right. But at the time didn't. And I had some hard questions, partially because I was a little bit cantankerous at 15. Yeah, but who isn't, right? Asking questions that I knew were hard about free will and yeah, predestination. Predestination, that's what I was going to say. And depravity. And can people actually do good? So questions that are hard for theologians to answer, I was throwing at my parents. Yeah. Were you actually wondering or were you just, okay, you weren't just asking them questions. Because there was a point when I was like, okay, I'm done with Christianity. Because my parents didn't have great answers for those at the time. Interesting. And I was like, if Christianity can't answer these questions, it's not worth my time. Wow. And so then dove pretty deeply into some of the other world religions. I was like, can anybody else answer these questions? By that point, I had already sort of come to the conclusion, again, per the creation of the universe of there had to be something. And so it was then has anybody figured out what it is? So deep thinker for a 15, 16 year old. Maybe. I'm also I am a contrarian to my core. Yeah. I like testing and arguing. And I do that in my own brain. With yourself. Oh yeah, absolutely. But also to everyone around me. And that was on full display at 15. So yeah, I landed my senior year on Christianity because a kind and generous teacher spent a lot of time engaging with inane questions. And me intentionally asking questions that were hard to answer. Wow. There it is again. That's a pattern we've seen so many times. And he eventually, I think, got frustrated with me and said, go read this book, and we'll talk when you're done. And he gave me the case for Christ. And that eventually led to mere Christianity. Good order. With Solis Drobel and then C.S. Lewis respectively. Solis Drobel is a lawyer. And the case for Christ is a very carefully rationally structured argument for why Christianity deserves a seat at the table. Because he started out to disprove it. I mean, it's the same thing of the Gospels, the anvil around which the hammers lay broken. Because very, very, very smart people, much smarter than me, have tried their best and failed to break Christianity. So, Strobel was compelling to me, but it was also kind of like, Strobel doesn't have a great picture of the power of story. He's a rational thinker. He makes some great points starting with the validity of Scripture, why we can trust the narratives we have, and builds from there. I guess sort of classic apologetics. But he doesn't capture why we should care. This is authoritative and it has power and value, but he doesn't say why it's compelling. Right. All logos. Very little pathos, very little ethos. Yeah. Yeah. And so, that led me to going back to my teacher and was like, okay, this was great. He's got good points, but why should I care? Right. And he was like, great, read this next. And that was, was that was mere Christianity? Okay. Because C.S. Lewis's conception, and it led me to C.S. Lewis' program's regress is what it led me to afterwards, which is a deep theological dive on apologetics and essentially building a proof, a rational proof for Christianity. Right. Backwards. Backwards, yes. Yeah. Because by then, he had gotten there, and then he built the pathway backwards. That's why it was the regress for the progress. Exactly. So, I mean, it is deductive reasoning properly because he starts with the conclusion and moves back through the premises. Right. And so, that, so, mere Christianity was like, C.S. Lewis talks through an idea called mythopoeia, or a true story. And his point is, it doesn't matter, other than Adam, which, believe me, Craig also talks through this, other than being a historical Adam, the historicity of any of the rest of the Old Testament is not relevant. It doesn't matter. And I know people are gonna probably be tensing up hearing that. It doesn't matter in a specific sense. And so, I'm... Yeah, which is what you're getting. Yeah. Yeah. That the historicity matters in that the stories show who God is. Right. And so, C.S. Lewis calls this the true myth, the myth in the sense of a story around which religious belief is built. And then the true myth is the myth that shows the true God by those stories. Right. And so, C.S. Lewis arrives at, I can take all of the good from the stories in Scripture without having to deal with fighting over whether or not it happened exactly as it happened, or as it's written. Right. That essentially, it could all be allegory, but if it shows who God is, it doesn't matter. It would still be valuable for that. Yes. So, whether it's historical or allegorical, it's still its main purpose is to reveal the identity and character of God. And so, if it turns out not to be historical, it can still accomplish that. If it turns out to be historical, it still accomplishes that. Precisely. And that's the concept of... That's what the technical meaning of irrelevant would mean. It's not that it doesn't matter at all to anything. It's that in regards to this topic, it is irrelevant in that it achieves its purpose, no matter which one it is. And that's a great... That's a tough one for some people to wrap their brains around. But again, it would go back to our conversation like that simple one we always do of the love letter. If it was intended to be allegorical, it's okay that it's allegorical. The only problem would be is if it was intended to be historical and was only allegorical or the other way around, that could create a problem. But we don't... There are many books in the historical books, many of the historical biblical books, which as we've said before, I assume are historical until I have a really good reason to change my mind on that, or at least even to question it. But the significance of them is their revelation of God and His opinion on things. But you were saying that book was... So the book is Mere Christianity, where he describes what the mythopoeia is. And it's one of the things that captured C.S. Lewis' imagination for the gospel and resulted in Narnia of him writing another mythopoeia, another myth that reveals the true God. And so you're saying that was compelling in your story specifically. Because it finally gave a why. Why should I care? So, okay, the Bible is true and Christianity is right religion. Great, I can get on board. But then Christianity also requires some pretty serious life changes based on the assumptions. And so in order to compel life changes, there has to be a serious reason to buy in. And the story of God with humanity is a serious reason to buy in. Absolutely. Is if I go ahead and agree that the Bible as we have it is teaching about the true God, then that is... I mean, per Daniel, that's a God who redeems. That's a God who saves. That there is powerful things there that begin to address some of the most difficult parts about being human, which is actually gonna lead really beautifully into discussion of worldview. Okay, good. So the framework I have come across to understand worldview is in four parts. As you guys are discovering and some of your listeners are too, I'm a structured thinker. I like things in bullet points. And so worldview as this amorphous thing is really hard for me to engage with because it's so all encompassing. It covers all of our fundamental assumptions about everything. Right. Even the things we don't think are assumptions. Precisely. In fact, the things we get mad that you claim are my assumptions. Exactly. No, I've got rational underlying beliefs for that. I mean, sort of. And the deeper that it gets, the harder it is to deal with it. Yeah, exactly. That's right. So a thinker in the 70s by the name of Leslie Stevenson broke down... He called them theories of human nature. It's what we would today call worldview. Okay. He broke it into four categories. And he uses some different language for it, but I'm gonna use the theological language for it. So he breaks it first into metaphysics or what we believe about reality. Okay. Then into anthropology or what we believe about humanity, who people are and what we are in the cosmos. Then the technical theological term, it's a mouthful, it's called hamartiology. Or... The doctrine of sin. The doctrine of sin. What's wrong with the world. That's right. And then the doctrine of soteriology or the doctrine of salvation, which is the solution. So he says that every cogent worldview addresses these four points. What's real? Who or what is humanity? What's broken in the world and how to fix it? Right. So kind of going back to C.S. Lewis a little bit, C.S. Lewis helped me wrap my head around an understanding of humanity's space in the world that is redeemable. It is the story of God making broken things do magnificent things. Because we all can look around and say there is brokenness. All of our worldview accounts for some sort of problem in the world, whether you think that's social justice, whether you think that's racism, whether you think that's systemic issues, or in the Christian terms, whether you think the problem is separation from God. We all look around and go, children being murdered is evil. People dying, there's something wrong with people dying. There's something innately like when our friends and parents die, there's something in us that screams rejection at that. We don't wanna go quietly. No. What is that? That's the poem? Do not go quietly. Do not go quite gently into that good night. Yeah, like rage against the burns maybe. Something I find real quick. Yeah, and so if we assume that there's something broken in the world, then again, I believe that the world is sensible. There should be a way to fix it. But then I look at my own life and the stories of the people around me and I see us doing our very best and doing it badly. There you go. Still in Thomas, by the way. Still in Thomas. Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. There you go. Sorry. Threw me back into 10th grade literature. And so then that demands some sort of solution. And so I think that Lee Strobel provided me with a framework to thoughtfully engage with metaphysics or reality. And I believe that scripture best deals with the facts on the ground as they are. But then that metaphysic doesn't give any reason for personal change. Okay, cool. Cool. It simply is, okay, there is now a God who has done amazing things in the past. That's great. But okay, what about my life? But then understanding the story of what God has done and the power of redemption throughout the Hebrew scriptures and then the magnificent redemption in the Gospels. Right. That's something that's worth sacrificing pleasure and other things, the hedonism that is available of letting that go in favor of following a New Testament ethic. Because I wanna be a part of that story. And the deeper I continue to know the Lord, the more bought in I am because I continue to see that redemption happen around me, of Him taking broken, tragic things and making magnificent things out of them. And that for me is worth the work of reconstructing every day. Because even as I'm confronted with difficulties with internal conflicts in scripture or what have you, suffering from suffering daily, reading the news is a good exercise in realizing that. Oh my gosh, yeah, God's deconstruction every day. But then coping with those things that my soul rejects that oughtn't to be. Being a part of the Gospel story makes it worth figuring out how do I relate to those things and building back into faith. Because I believe that there is salvation and because I believe that the prescription for the brokenness that is, is God's story. So that would be the anthropology moving into the third one. You can't pull them all completely apart. They each depends on the others. Certainly not if it's a narrative, not if it's a story. You can't just do that. Each depends on the other. You might say that the metaphysic is the setting, the anthropology is the cast, and the plot is written by the hamardiology into soteriology. But if you pull any one of those out, none of the rest of it works. Which is why I think you end up with a secular world desperately clinging to some sort of systemic reform, because that's their soteriology. The resolution to their plot is fixing the system. So if there is no God, if there is no... In the metaphysic where there is nothing higher than the material world, and humanity is simply evolved amoebas, and we are causing horrific ills to each other, which I recognize assume some morality issues. Hills, use the proper amoral word. Some ills, some problems, if you will, that to fix those problems, the only way to fix it is to fix the systems, which then there is a ton of emotional buy-in. And as I think you guys talk through some politics stuff, the emotional buy-in in politics is because that is salvation. And if that's where your salvation is, of course you're going to live and die on those hills. In the same way that I would die for my faith, because that is salvation. There is no better thing to die for. But there's not a... It's like there's not an answer to the question of a personal salvation anymore in the humanist or in the new secular progressive worldview systems. It's like the personal salvation is not relevant. In the same way that personal justice has been thrown out, traditional personal justice has been thrown out for social, systemic justice. And so... Sort of. It depends on... I mean, we're essentially operating in a utilitarian culture, properly speaking at this point. So utilitarian in the sense of what things ought to be, what helps the most people. Right. And so in the sense of there is personal salvation in that as societal ills are solved, there is moral high ground to be gained. Yes, it is a personal salvation. You have contributed to the good of humanity and therefore saved yourself and your children by fixing the system. So sort of, but the personal in the sense of, if I'm the only one saved, then I'm still saved that is gone. Right, right. Nothing about me lasts past my lifetime here. Correct. Which is depressing. Oh, yes. That's the... One of the things we've come back to over and over again is how few of these ills are solved by removing God from the conversation, but how all hope of redemption of these ills is removed by removing God from the conversation. Like it's a... As we talked about with Dan Ray, like the ultimate form of child abuse is for an atheist to have children or for an atheist who says, this world is not worth living in. Like there's so many it's evil. There's so many horrible things in this world. There's all this terrible suffering and horror and that's proof that there is no God. And I, and you go, okay, so you're going to bring a child into that and you're going to just tell them from the beginning, yes, this is a horrible, twisted, dark, evil world. You might try to impact that positively for someone, but in the end, you're actually not going to... Then you're going to suffer for all the however many years you live between a few minutes to 70, 80 years, and then you'll die and there won't be any value to any of that. And based on, at least based on history, you probably won't make any meaningful change in the long run, especially in utilitarian culture where they don't, where heroes aren't honored, individuals don't get to change the world. Only all of us can change the world, not any of us. So it's a tough world to bring a child into with that viewpoint. Yeah. And it's part of why I continue to struggle with any kind of rational engagement with a true secular worldview. Because if materialism is true, then everything is meaningless. And I believe the world makes sense. And so if everything is meaningless, then nothing makes sense. The only thing that it can... It eliminates deductive reasoning entirely for... Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm speaking technically. Mine went to for inductive reasoning, which you can only ever make assumptions. You can make good observations, but all you're doing is eventually making assumptions. There's nothing sensible to be solidified. And they are only as good as they are until they're disproven, which is exhausting. Yes. Instead of acknowledging the hope of that there is some way that this can be redeemed. That's what's intriguing to me is the soteriology. Just even wrestling through the conversation of... It feels more and more, especially with my kids when I'm watching movies and reading books and stuff like that in the modern era, of course, which they don't do. Now they just watch YouTube stuff. But then there's no time for this whole story to be written out. Uh-huh. The whole hero's arc is intriguing. And the hero's arc, which was the way stories were told forever, are so redemptive. It's so redemptive in nature. There is value to this suffering. There is something that's going to be accomplished that is bigger than you. There is all of that message. And yet, as all of that gets stripped away and now there's not time for that, or the story we tell is all deconstruction stories, not construction stories, the building of a person you have to tear down. The hero is the one who destroys the system, not the one who builds a new one even. But anyway, it's just, I feel like we've lost. We're losing something very, very important with those stories being stolen from us. And instead, now we just do short... I've even... Okay, so the part of where this comes out, sorry, I'm struggling here, but the part of this is watching a movie with my son the other night. And we were talking about how in modern media no one prays. I mean, their house is surrounded by zombies scraping on the window. They have no hope. They're all going to die. And they've now come to that realization and no one prays. Whereas real human beings under those conditions, though they know nothing about God, they pray. And so that's reality. And yet that is never shown now. I feel like Band of Brothers is one of the last things I've watched where you have a bunch of men in foxholes, many of whom are not believers, but man, they pray. When you're in Bastogne and there's shells going off, blowing trees apart all around you, it turns out you're not so convicted of your atheism that you thought you were. And I think that would be the case. Anyway, we're watching in preparation for the new Mission Impossible movie, Holland and Everything, the third one, which we can debate whether it's the best one, I think it is. But the... There's a lot of them now. I know there's a bunch, but in it, I was intrigued. I had forgotten. There's a scene where it's the scene where Ethan's got a certain number of minutes to go find the rabbit's foot, and he's vanished into a building. And they intriguingly tell this part of the story from those who are watching, not from his. And so he's gone into a building and you don't know what's going on. And you're sitting there in tension, like time's running out. He's down to a few seconds. And then you get this great, like, you know, he's suddenly screaming into the mic, I can't get to the roof and look up, look up, look up. And he's jumping out of a window at like a, you know, 20th store. Anyway, but there's a little moment which is intriguing that I had forgotten that where the lady, one of the ladies is sitting there mumbling under her breath and the guy next to her goes, what are you doing? And she's like, all embarrassed. Like she's totally humiliating this moment. And she goes, when I was a little girl, my mom and my little dog would run away. My mom taught me a prayer to pray for him to return. And it's a sweet scene. And the guy who clearly is the, he's, he's been portrayed as the most jaded of all the characters. He goes, well, teach me. Oh, I do remember that. And I was like, I've forgotten all about that scene. That's realistic. Yes. Human beings are desperately looking for a redemption to the story. So terriology is real. We know something's broken. And even under those conditions, there is something in us intrinsic that does that. Now, again, it craves revolution resolution. The reason that all stories have a descending arc is because we need that resolution. And why the modern stories, many of which don't are, they flop because no one cares. They're not interesting. There's nothing. Yeah. I got, I, I, this would be a totally separate podcast, but it is a, it is wild to me that, that right now storytellers in Hollywood can't figure out why their movies keep failing. And you're like, they don't want to give in to the fact that there is, I've wondered that we probably should not start this. But, but I think this fits up what we're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. I have wondered if it's, is it that they don't know, or it's just that to admit something like we want resolution admits a bigger worldview that they, that they can't admit to. It must not be true. Yeah. Without it, without giving a lot of the rest of their worldview up. That's an intriguing, because it resonates. I haven't thought that before, but that feels true. It's a, it's a death to give up a worldview perspective. It is, that's what we call it conversion. I mean, it's, it is a, you are one thing and now you're another. And that's never a comfortable metamorphosis. And like Zach saying, all of these are combined, like all these four parts of worldview are overlapping. And so to give up one piece of it or to give way to the enemy, I'm sure is, you know, how our culture treats different world views is to admit other pieces of this that you, you don't want to be true. Wow. And I think on, along those lines to admit a soteriology that is beyond humanity saving itself. Yeah. Demands an adjustment in metaphysics. Yeah. Because you are admitting that humanity can't save itself. And so if, if you admit that, you are seeding the reality that there is a morality beyond us, which lands you back in arguments for God. Yeah, exactly. It's the ontological, right? That is, so there's the moral. Moral argument. Ontological. Yeah. You're by seeding the need for a soteriology beyond humanity. Yeah. You land right back in the purpose-based. Yeah. There has to, there is something. And what could it be? And then you're forced to acknowledge that there is something. Which then forces you to recalibrate the whole rest of the system. Right. Exactly. Yeah. That's what I've, I've thought for years, either, either. And I talked to somebody just the other day, like I am willing to acknowledge that all of this may be fake. Like our brains are really good at finding patterns. And sometimes we find patterns where there is no pattern. Certainly. And it could be that the entire conversation about God, purpose, meaning, value, all of that is just, it's just an optical illusion that our brain has a sign meaning where there is absolutely none, which is the one thing I used to admire about, oh, who was the first of the kind of neo-atheists, the biologist? Why am I blinking on his name? Oh, come on. Dawkins was because he acknowledged that in his first book. There is nothing. We, this is a merciless, meaningless world. Like that was his, and there is initial stance was we, there is no meaning. There's absolutely no meaning, no purpose, no, no, he, now, now since then he's walked all that back, because it wasn't super popular among his friends. Well, it's because he got confronted in debate with then is there cruelty, right? Which is, I think such a brilliant way of coming at that, rather than is there altruism, which is easy to argue. Yeah. It's really hard to argue that there is no such thing as cruelty. That's right. You cannot assign cruelty to any behavior, any action, any motivation. Is it evolutionary practice? Is it evolutionarily practical? Right. That's the only thing you can ask. Yeah. Yep. And that leaves a horrific world. Yeah. Yeah. If that's what you're left with, that is a, that is such a dark claw tooth world that, that it's, and something in us rebels against that. Is it possible that it's an over evolved brain that rebels against that? It is possible. But it's not, that is not the plausible answer. And what we see around us, in my opinion, lowers that down to a tiny, pretty tiny percentage of being the most likely answer. It is more likely that there is meaning to things. There actually is meaning to these things. And where we are correctly identifying something that is true, not inventing something. And I think the evidence is much stronger for that. And the humanist worldview, which has always, ever since I learned about it, I remember the first time I learned about humanism, I guess I was in college and I actually laughed out loud because I thought the person was telling a joke. Like when they described humanism, I laughed. I was like, that's, that's awesome. Like that's a, and I was, oh wait, you're serious. Like you're, you really are, you really are turning to humanity for, for purpose and meaning and significance. And, and you know, you, I think you need to get out more. Like I think you need to meet some more people because, uh, you remember, um, you've heard me say this, but the old Homer Simpson, uh, reference to beer beer is the cause of and solution to all of man's problems. And, and, and I was like, humanism just takes out the word beard puts in humans. Yeah. Humans are the cause of and solution to all of our problems. And it's just as absurd as it sounds that you would go, Oh, that's that you talk about returning to the ex-boyfriend. That is, that is the worst possible. Like he was horrible. He saw, he created all these problems for me. I wonder if he can solve them. I'm guessing, no, I'm just going to go with no, it's not likely. So anyway, I, I like this and I, I hope like what, so some sources made me think of, you know, I know Lewis wrote a lot about this Epic story being told. Um, I think there was a book relatively recently that John Eldridge may have written call. He may have even called it Epic. But I think, I think there's some great resources out there to engage with this conversation. You have some favorite Zach of what you would point people to, or even favorite resources when it comes to you. If there's someone who's think, who thinks similarly to you where, um, the world, you won't, the, you know, that the world makes sense and you want answers for things and you're not, I think Lee Strobel is hard to beat. Um, he's been popular for decades because his work is excellent. Um, I mean, it kind of just depends on how deep somebody wants to go. Yeah. Um, I have fully gone down the rabbit hole. Um, which is awesome. But that, yeah, Leslie Stevenson's framework, he talks about, um, the newer additions are, I think now 13. His original book was seven theories of human nature. Okay. Um, and he talked through, um, sort of Socratic and Aristotelian thought, um, platonic thought, um, Marxist, Christian, Islamic, um, and I'm missing one, but it's been expanded now to include Buddhist Hinduism, um, Confucian. Anyway, it goes on. It's now, so he has multiple, um, additions. Okay. And it's been, yeah, redone lots of times since the seventies. Okay. Um, but this is Stevens. Stevenson. Stevens son. Okay. Leslie Stevenson. Um, and I, again, I would, his framework for dealing with worldview is really helpful. Okay. Um, it is worth doing your own research on his descriptions of those systems, but the framework is superb. Um, I don't necessarily end up agreeing with him on even his analysis of them, but that's fine. But the framework is excellent. Okay. Um, anything by Lewis, um, shout out for CSB. Yeah, exactly. I, even the stuff I don't agree with him on, he's asking good questions. Oh yeah. Um, and making really, really excellent observations about the nature and character of who God is and how God treats with humans. Um, so yeah, both of those, and then the deeper someone wants to go, I love most very variations of systematic theology. Um, there have been dozens of them written over the years, like the book systematic theology. So, I mean, I love Wayne Grudem, which is showing my theological stripes a little bit. Um, but there are truly dozens. Um, and that's going to do put theology into a framework that's a little bit easier to compartmentalize. Yeah. Um, you know, Dr. Craig is wrapping up as I understand it, his philosophical theological. I'm so excited. Yeah. Um, his treatment of the historical Adam was brilliant. It was so, um, he's, he's dragged me kicking and screaming into several things that I was like, I've picked up the book, read his thesis and like, no, he will never convince me. And by the end I'm like, okay, fine. You're right. Um, God in time was my favorite of those. I don't know that I've read a book of his that I don't like. I disagree with him on a lot of stuff. Yeah. Sure. But he is, I mean, I think he's going to be remembered as one of the preeminent thinkers of our era. I think so too. Um, in company with Carl, um, Carl Bart and CS Lewis and like some of the giants, I think, yeah. Craig is going to stand with those guys. That's awesome. That's very cool. Well, before we close, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or say Zach or, or something that you would want to say to listeners? Maybe I don't, I would just say, just keep asking questions that even questions that are scary to ask are worth being asked if you're willing to hear the answer. That's good. That's good. You don't have an online presence at this point or do you? Do you have a web log or anything? Not really. Okay. But if people have questions, they can reach out to us and we can pass them on. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. This has been great. Yeah. Thanks so much Zach. We really enjoyed this. Thank you so much for having me. This is awesome.
