We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hello and welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner and while several of us are out of the office during the holidays, we are sharing valuable episodes that we hope will encourage you and remind you of truth. In the meantime, we are busy putting together our new series that centers on politics as it relates to faith and foundations, as well as digging into tough topics under the umbrella of politics that have led people to question their faith and deconstruct. We hope you enjoy the episode and we can't wait to jump into our new series soon. Well today we are going to revisit some of the definite definition of Christianity as we kind of continue our conversation about reconstructed faith. So I'm going to throw it over to Chris Legg first today. Yeah, this one's this one's my fault. I came in saying, okay, I just listened walking around the neighborhood last night with my kids, extorting candy from strangers. I was listening to the podcast and I realized two things. One, I talk too much on the podcast. So one, we'll be working on that one. But the number two is a lot of good things to say. See, that's what I tell myself right there. But now that's why I pay you. But now we both have a mute button that we just push. Yes, exactly right. They pointed me and I will stop mid conversation. So Chris has told us to interrupt him. If they do, if my wife listens to this podcast, she'll be like, Hey, hey, he doesn't let me do that. But anyway, all right. So, uh, okay. So looking at this conversation, um, on Christianity, here's what I realized. So as we talked about, and I think fairly appropriately kept saying, this is hard to define Christianity. And we really spent the podcast talking about what makes it hard to define it, which I thought was valuable. I, I'm not saying it wasn't good in that sense, but here's what struck me is that, is that I think partial because of the nature of this podcast, we were talking it in terms of truth claims, um, which is, which again is also right. There is a series of truth claims, but I think, I think if I've been listening to the podcast and it wasn't my podcast, now that's true. Our podcast, I was screaming at it to do the same thing. Like, no, Christianity is not merely about truth claims. It's about the person, Jesus Christ. Like it's, um, that to me struck me as, uh, what part of what makes it so difficult to summarize with merely truth claims is in the same way, it would be difficult to summarize my marriage with merely truth claims. Like, no, no, you can't take ginger out of this and understand my marriage. And, and I think it's natural for us to say, okay, so here are the truth claims that Christianity makes a healthy, good conversation and we'll continue to have it. And the most important truth claim of Christianity is that, that Jesus Christ is, and that that's the, there is this, there's this guy, Jesus Christ, and he has a relationship with us and defining relationships is a whole lot harder than just defining truth claims. So, uh, anyway, that struck me as significant. That's great. And then with that, Chris, we were talking Chris shared, I think it would be valuable for you to now unpack a little bit about what we don't mean by Christianity and how that has come up just in regular conversation for you. Yeah. Well, yeah. Just this morning, I was, uh, talking to someone and it was really great when you have to kind of go back to, I'm, I can't assume that, you know, all of these words that I, all these Christianese words that we use and just have to re-explain it in really, really basic, um, ways. And so I actually used the phrase that Chris had just mentioned about it. It's a relationship, not a religion, but I, I qualified it. I said, I mean, technically it is a religion. It's, it's a bunch of, of, you know, this is what we believe and don't believe in how you know what you should follow, but it is ultimately about restoring my relationship with God. And so it gets back to then the heart of the gospel and why do I need to be, you know, saved that we already talked about. But what I tried to explain was the difference between, uh, who I am versus what I do. And I was, I was explaining that in, in Christianity, it's who I am in Christ that identifies me. It's not what I do that I have to do a bunch of things. Yeah. Um, and I did use in our, our Wednesday night evangelism class, we're talking about these diagnostic questions and I did actually bring those up. Do you know for certain, if you were to die today, you'd go to heaven. And then if you were to stand before God and say, and God were to say, why should I let you know my heaven? What would you say? And it just gets back to what are you depending on? But ultimately it still comes back to the person of Jesus. And that's where all the scriptures pointing to him, either looking ahead to him or looking back to what he did and who he is and what our worship is all about. Um, that he's Lord of all the universe. And there's a whole bunch of verses about that by him, all things were created and exist for him and things. But ultimately I was just trying to explain, like it's, it's not substitute that religion now for our religion. It's who Jesus is and what he did. And I think one of the huge revelations I had not long ago was that Paul actually never ever uses the word Christian, not that it's a bad word, but to describe us. In fact, it only shows up, we're addressed as Christians only once in 1 Peter 4, mentioned twice in the book of Acts as a title. But over a hundred times Paul uses the phrase in Christ or some form of that to describe who we are and what, what, you know, identifies us. And so um, he tries to use it in different ways. The first time he did it was in, uh, Roman six. Um, and he used the idea of like being buried in him or baptized in him. He's used words like we're clothed in him. Uh, everything that he's trying to get us to wrap our minds around is, do you understand that this is your identity? You are in him, what he did for you and in your place, dying the death that you should have died, living the life that you should have lived. All of that is wrapped up in who Jesus is. And so even the distinction that we were just talking about before we got recording in that with Buddhism, you can take Buddha out of the formula and you still have the basic tenets of this is what Buddhism is about or, or other religions, but you take Jesus out of Christianity and you got nothing. Um, it's literally all about him and he's been the focus the whole time and is what it's all about. It's not just add him on, even me explaining to this, um, friend that I was talking to that this is not just, I'm adding Jesus onto my life. It's, he is my life that he's everything. Yeah. Um, that's great. Which is a big price tag that he, I mean, it wasn't like he hinted at, he made it very clear. Like following me means you're giving me your all your everything. So taking a couple of steps back, we were talking about the difference between who I am versus what I do. We talk about this a lot in the Christian circles, if you're like behavioral modification versus heart change and relationship. Why is that our, why, why do we always turn or it seems that we always turn to works based what I do? How can I make myself good enough? Like why is, do you know, why that's like within Christianity, why that's the case? Well, I guess I'm thinking about our listeners in Christianity, but most all religions are, well, what do I do to, that's a great question. I think, gosh, there's a lot of directions to go with that. One would be, um, I think, I think one of them, it comes down to the, some of the root sociological kind of views on, on even what, what religion is. And then at least in one of the main, I know there's two main theories on how religion develops outside of God. So secular perspectives. And one of them is essentially we have traits we like in ourselves. So then we apply them to our gods or our animals, and then we worship those traits. And so in the end, all we're really worshiping as ourselves. And so it makes sense that therefore we are the ones who could solve whatever problems we face, because we're really just worshiping ourselves in the name of an animal or a God like in totemism, it's an animal or a symbol with most polytheism, it's a God, but the gods still just bear our traits. They're not different than us. They're not, they're not quantitatively. No, they're not qualitatively different than us. They're just quantitatively different than us. And so I think that would be a part of it is within general, why that's a natural instinct for religions to turn into a list of rules, which is what religion means, right? Order. So I would say that's gotta be a part of it. Okay. And even struggling with the, what do I do even after I'm a believer? Like this is what the conversation with my friend today turned back to. So now when you become a Christian, then you're good because you're paying God back. And I was like, no, no, no, it's not, that's still not my motive. Like I'm trying to pay God back for all the good things that he's done for me. I just explained, like, I get to do these things. I have a new heart. I have new desires. And it's not just a bunch of rules now that I've substituted the old moral, moralism with a new set of morals. It's motivated by love or a new, and again, I'm totally honest with like, but I'm, I don't always want to do that. There's a struggle going on, but I think there's a natural bent in us to want to reciprocate. Like you're nice to me that I'm nice to you, or you're not nice to me. You deserve this. And so we, we apply that then to our walk with God, and we're thinking like, well, therefore, if he's going to be nice and let me into heaven, I better do that. He sees it as transactional. Transactional is the word I was waiting. Yeah. Looking for, I think that's the transactional is exactly the way we, we want it to be transactional. And we even understand that like we, that we can wrap our brains around because we do that so often with each other, but it's not transactional. It's also really humbling to say there's nothing that I did to get me here. It was totally God. You know what I'm saying? I want to be able to say I contributed some, right? I was a nice guy and therefore that tip this scale. Like, it's just really in our modern mind, especially, you know, we just don't like the idea of like, I'm really that bad that the only way was to save me was that God had actually become a man and die in my place. Like that's how bad I was that it's, it's, it's, I'm that pathetic and people don't like that. Okay. Thank you guys for taking a second to unpack that a little bit. I'm sure it'll keep coming up. Yeah. As we're talking about that, because I think the whole transactional thing can be really hard for people to get past. And then when you're dealing with, I mean, people, I'm going back to what we talked about in the worldly theories, people doing things pragmatically or re rebuilding or reconstructing their faith with that pragmatic or pragmatism theory of truth, where it's like, you're doing things, you're kind of going through the motions for the sake of, was it social capital or community capital or whatever, that it's easy for us to get into the, well, I need to do these things that I can be accepted or do these things or whatever. So yeah, that's great. Paul in first Corinthians four, Paul actually interjects in this midst of, you know, he cares about the Corinthian church. They're really immature, but in the midst of them fighting over who they followed and bragging on, I follow Paul, Paul, Paul, Sir Peter, but he actually kind of takes the time out and goes, okay, just so you guys know, I don't care what you or any human court says about me. So he brings in the image of a court and Tim Keller explains is really, really good in his book, the freedom of self-forgetfulness. Then in a court of law, you're hearing evidences on both sides. If you're on trial for you against you, and then you you're waiting for the verdict. Am I acquitted? Am I guilty type thing? And what he says is Christianity is the only religion where you get the verdict before your performance, where not counting everything that I've done or not done, good or bad, whatever, God, because of Jesus already says, I declare you not guilty. I declare you completely just as if you've always come right, which is crazy. Every other religion is I'm relating to God because of what I do. The reason God accepts me is because I do these things. And I mean, I think not even other religions or cults even, but there's a lot of people in just Baptist Protestant churches that think God accepts me because of what I do. And the hard part of being on staff is if I think my standing before God is based on what I do, then I'll volunteer, I'll tithe, I'll teach, I'll serve, I'll stay after to set up chairs, whatever, because that's how I get right with God. But if I understand I'm right with God because of what Jesus did for me, then I might tithe and serve and teach, stay after and set up chairs because I get two. So on the surface, it looks the same, but it's all do you understand why you're doing these things? Yeah, like what's going on there, what Jesus did for you? That's, that's a, gosh, this is good. I'm glad we're, we're kind of revisiting this. I think that one of the ways I even think through the gospel is like, um, I tell people, if you join a class, if you decided to take a class, so, so if you could go back to college and take one class, what would you, what topic would you study? I think I would probably study something along the lines of hermeneutics or something like that. Because I didn't, I didn't, yeah, I didn't do many Bible classes. Perfect. So let's say you decide you're going to go, you know, to one of the seminaries and you're going to take hermeneutics class and the professor walks in and it turns out to the professor you really, you really, really like they've hired Chris Sherrod to be the world renowned speaker. That's right. And so you get, you get, he comes in and he's going to speak, you know him, you love him. You think he's a great teacher. You're like, I had no idea what a, what a bonus, right? And Chris comes in and says, okay, you get, um, uh, we're going to call roll. And when you answer here, um, I'm going to mark a 100 in the final grade column for the class. So 100, um, not just an A or B, but a 100, not just passing grade, but a 100. Um, that's one of my mark. Now, just so you'll know between now and then you're probably going to fail this class a lot. Like the tests are hard. The quizzes are impossible. The paperwork. I mean, oh my gosh, the papers you're going to write, you've never written anything like this and it's going to be really, really hard. And there will be bonus questions and there will be bonus work and all this extra stuff. And then your final grade will be a 100. If you answer here today at the roll call. And, and then you say, so, so then what would possibly motivate me to take this? I mean, to do the hard work. I mean, why would I do it? Like I'm not afraid of losing my 100. And it's funny to hear people describe when I asked that question and they'll say like, well, it could be a trick, you know, or, or maybe I could make 104 in the class. Like, no, no, see it's a 100. The final thing. And they give all these reasons that are all fear based. But as I keep setting this, no, see, that's not going to, it's, I promise you he's, he's, he's, he's never lied. He's not going to like it's a 100. And then they start getting creative. Like, well, gosh, I could, I could write a paper on whatever I want. Like really wanted to, how many of you have ever written a paper in school that you thought this is ridiculous. I can't believe I have to write this until the professor, exactly what they want to hear. So that's all I'm going to do. Well, what if you, what if you want to write a paper and it, Hey, you have a different opinion than Chris Sherrod and you know, he's going to be ticked off at what you've written. Well, you can still do that because you have 100 in the final grade column, or if you're going, I want to explore an idea that may turn out to be terrible, but I want to explore it. I want to, I want to unpack this and really try to learn, or I want to try something that I know I don't know how to do. Or, you know, you go to Chris, say I'm going to write a song. I don't even really know how to write music and I don't know how to play the piano, but I'm going to play it on the piano as my final grade. You know, I went for my final exam and he's like, great, go for it. Knock yourself out. This sounds like a great idea. Do it. You know, like, I'm, what kind of grade am I going to get? And he's like, I'm sure you'll fail it. I'm sure it'll bomb. I mean, it'll be horrible, but you get to do that and you get to, you get to engage. Is it hard? Yes. And so it's like the difference between learning Chinese because you're in a class of Chinese and learning Chinese because you've fallen in love with a girl who speaks Chinese and they're both this behaviorally. They look really similar, but they're nothing alike. If you're, if you're listening to the podcast and you're married, you can imagine the difference between being seduced by your spouse because they're supposed to seduce you versus being seduced by your spouse because they want you. Those are not behaviorally. Those may look really similar. They are not the same. And, and if you, if it's rules based, you can only get one. You can't get the other one. I think a lot of times what I was, the reason I asked earlier Colson, which one you meant was, do you mean in the church or do you mean in general? I mean, it breaks my heart that I think probably the reason a lot of Christians and non-Christians who don't know the church or deconstructing their faith, they're, they are deconstructing a faith that taught them exactly against what we're talking about, that it is a series of rules. There is this Santa Claus, God who's keeping track of whether you're naughty or nice, and he's going to reward or punish you. It's this karma God, not the God who exists, or it's a, I don't, the old man in the sky, there's so many of these presentations of the Christian God that deserve to be deconstructed because they don't exist. They're not real. And I was raised with a behavioral modification type of version of Christianity, and that had to be deconstructed, or I either had to leave the faith or, or learn that that wasn't the truth. So that's an example of what you're asking. I think sadly, sometimes people deconstruct this or they hear that and they go, Oh, it must be rules based. Oh, it's just a series of activities. Oh, it's just a, because that's what they've been told and taught sometimes from a pulpit. Yeah. Okay. That's great. Well, so we're, now we've been jumping in and talking more about that. It's a relationship. Yeah. A relationship with Jesus. I think it would probably be good for us to define who do we mean when we say Jesus. Right. Yeah. So go ahead and Chris, share it. If you want to start us off. Can I read from Colossians one, my letter read the Bible. I think you, I was just showing the thing as we talked about that, I was thinking, well, let me just go to a really good description. Yeah. Because there's a lot of verses we can go to. I just like this because it's, it's very, it covers a lot. I'm going to read in verse 15. It says, he talking about Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for by him, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things and in him, all things hold together. The word all keeps showing up by the way. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent for in him, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. And then it talks about the personal application in our lives. And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him. And it goes on to some other things, but I just, that was a good summary of all things, everything, all things. It's not, he's not just on par with other, you know, good religious moral teachers. He's fully God. And the next chapter, it says, for in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. It's fully God became fully man, which we mentioned a little bit. So where do people get that wrong? A lot of times, like we talk about why it's important for us to define who we, who we, who we mean when we say Jesus, right? Why is that important? Well, you want is as full an understanding as you can get, right? So if you say he was a rabbi who walked the planet in the Middle East 2000 years ago, that's not wrong. He was a rabbi. If you say that he was a religious leader or religious teacher who taught moral, morally significant things, I mean, that's, that's true. But what people have been saying almost since the time he was here and the maybe CS Lewis gets the most credit for is you can't leave him there. He's not, he did not, he did not leave it as an option that he would just be a moral teacher or a religious leader or a rabbi from 2000 years ago, or the son of a carpenter or the even a half son of a carpenter. He didn't leave that as an option. You're stuck with him being something more than that with the teachings in scripture that he can't, if he was, if he was just a moral teacher and he's misled directly or indirectly about one in every three people in the last 2000 years into believing that the most important thing in their life was, is based on a lie. No one comes close to him as far as being a tyrant or a madman or a horrible person or, or he was a nutcase, someone who thought he was God in the same way that some people think they're Napoleon or that they're a lemon square. It doesn't, it doesn't, they weren't, this is, this is before people could just identify as something, you know? So, and then Josh McDowell turned it into the liar lunatic lord thing. I actually heard once in, I think this is the Latin phrase et duce et homo malice, either God or a bad man. That was an old, an old phrase before she is loose, but it's at least saying he's either a bad man, a madman or the God man. Right. That's another way to put it. But when people say he's just a good moral teacher, a lot of Christians go, okay, well yeah, I guess we do believe that. And they just kind of leave it there. But, but like Chris said, he didn't leave it there. Right. Because again, if he's, if he's telling you, trust in me for your eternal destiny and he knows that he's lying, that's evil. Yeah. Like that's telling a whole lot of people, you know, to stake your eternal claim and your relationship, you know, with God on me and he knows that he's lying. That's not a good moral teacher. Right. So. In fact, it's one of the things that's intriguing is, is that people will sometimes say Jesus never claimed to be God. And I guess we could clear up that real quick. Yeah. So I know that at the beginning, we wanted to define a lot of our concepts and terms outside of scripture and we'll continue to try to defend a lot of the truth claims of Christianity outside of that, knowing that that's not something that that everyone equally admires. And in fact, I think probably we'll spend more than a little bit of time unpacking why we do trust scripture to be a source of revelation, but are what we call the Holy Bible. But Jesus, Jesus does claim clearly, and he doesn't say it in English, which I think is what confuses people. There's not a, there's not a sentence where Jesus says, I am God. But he, he wouldn't have in his day and age. In fact, if he had of it, might or might not have been clearly understood what he was saying. But, but what we do have is that in, in a question and answer situation before the religious leaders, and you can find this if you need to look in John eight. So if you get down to 56 ish, Jesus is speaking and he says, your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad. So the Jews said to him, you're not, not yet 50 years old and you have seen Abraham. And Jesus said to them, truly, truly, I say to you before Abraham was I am. And, uh, they, they pick up stones to throw at him, which they clearly think he's claiming to be God. They crucified him for claiming to be God. They weren't picking up stones to say, like, get out of here. No, we're going to kill you now. Right. That's why they picked up stones in the temple. They felt justified on executing him right then and there. And, and, um, so he runs and he actually hides himself. It says, um, that's not, it was not the, he just kind of vanished some kind of supernatural trick there. But, but what matters here is it clearly is the claim. When you say the phrase before Abraham was, I am, you are very clearly claiming to be Yahweh, which means I am it is the, it is the clear claim to be the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, which is why they want to kill him. I mean, he's committed the ultimate in heresy unless he is Yahweh. And so there's really a phrase, a place like this only has two options. Either he is, or he is the great blasphemer and was worthy, was deserving of the death he was about to get from the Jewish perspective. Or he is, he is who he says he was. And there's just not a lot of, there's really no good way of, of getting around the fact that he claimed to be God. He was by his immediate followers, understood to be God, worshiped as God. And, um, from, from very early on and then proclaimed it in unclu, in no uncertain terms all through early Christianity. So either he was long before, always has been God and then came to experience life, to come and live life as a human being, which is the basic, one of the basic claims. And he was the friend of these men and he was the son of Mary and the half son of Joseph or, or the stepson of Joseph, I guess, not the half son, but the, um, you know what I mean? So the, um, the, uh, the stepson of Joseph, but these, the half, excuse me, the half sibling of James and Jude. And, and so that's really what's left to us is that's, that's who we're talking about the, the, all of the claims made by him about himself or by his immediate followers about him. Those are what we're looking at. And yes, that it does include being a rabbi 2000 years ago, and it does include being a religious leader. And it does include being maybe someone who worked in his, you know, in Joseph's carpentry shop, all those things were some people say, you know, I follow a Jewish carpenter. Well, that's not necessarily wrong, or, uh, or whatever, but that's not all, that's not all of it is important. And as we go back to understanding him as a Jewish rabbi, there's cool things we understand from that, but he's also all the things that Christian has read from Paul's letter. This is who Jesus is also all of these other things by whom for whom and through whom all things were created. So that's what we mean. We're talking about Jesus is yes, Jesus of Nazareth, the wise man from 2000 years ago who walked the earth, but also Jesus, the second person of the Trinity who existed before the creation of time and has just now been revealed to us or Jesus who will come back and take his people home and judge the world like this, all the same guy. Yeah. As you guys have spent a decent amount of time engaging in these conversations with people about saying, okay, this is what Christianity is. This is what Christianity isn't. When you talk about having a relationship with Jesus, do people ever have people ever given you like weird looks like, well, okay, well, how do I have a relationship with somebody who I can't see or who lived that long ago? Because that's very, it's a very different relationship than any other relationship. I guess we're used to for sure in our American context. That's a great question. So I think, well, I think is, I even saw a teacher one time that said Jesus is my BFF and it's cute, but it's not even the same type of a relationship. Anyways, I mean, it is a relationship, but to compare it to that. And so I think that is one thing that it's not, it's not, he's not your buddy. There's another teacher I saw said Jesus is my home boy. And I'm not, because you think of, you understand what there's, we understand what you're making, right? Close. Yeah. But it's, it's not bad. It's, it's way more than just that. I was even thinking of John who wrote the book of John. It was called the beloved or he's had this extra close relationship with Jesus also wrote the book of revelation. And in it, you've got the very first chapter of Jesus showing up and John sees him and you don't get this, yo bro, how you been? You get this seeing Jesus in all his glory and John falls down like as if he's dead. Like he's just so overwhelmed with who Jesus actually is. So even the idea that it is a friendship, I mean, the Bible talks about, um, this is just called the friend of God, you know, those kinds of things, but it's still on just, it's hard to explain it the same way that we think of a relationship. Yeah. But it is still one that I, I'm talking to him. I'm reading his word. Um, I believe he's, he's, you know, will convict me and is, um, you know, getting my attention if I'm off track, you know, so there is a relationship type there, but it's not like, but you start pulling in things like the Bible because if it's like, oh, how do I talk to him? So it's like, it's not like I pull up an extra chair, coffee, and I'm just assuming like it's some magical whatever. I'm again, assuming that the Bible is his word and he speaks to me through that and the Holy Spirit enlightens me as I'm reading. So it's a, it's ongoing relationship. It's not the, what I do. Yeah. Um, that doesn't define it, but what I do is a part of it. So again, my relationship with my wife is not, well, I take her on dates and I make coffee for her. And I, that's what I do. It overflows out of our relationship. I don't know. What do you think Chris? Yeah, I think, I think that's a, it I've teased before or said before kind of, I think, I think there are times when probably, uh, if my relationship with, if my relationship with God was like my relationship with, no, if my relationship by the wife was like my relationship with God, I'd be a first-class stalker. Like I love the things of God. I love studying God. I like looking at what God's done. I like reading his books, like telling his stories. I like all this, but it's amazing how often I can fall into the trap of, but I haven't talked with him in a while. I haven't set and just been still for a while and let him communicate with me the way he desires to communicate with me, which is seems to be different person to person. Again, that shouldn't surprise us, but yeah, I feel like, I feel like I don't, I actually, what's interesting is I don't know that I've ever had a non-believer asked me, how do I have a relationship with a person who's not like that? They may ask me, how do I get saved? Meaning, how do I initiate that relationship? How do I start that relationship? How do I make that step? But it's, it's always other believers who are asking what do I need to do? Cause I feel like I've grown further from God or I'm not related to him. And keep in mind, Jesus said that our heart follows our treasure. And so he predicts about us that where we invest our time, our energy, our money, our resources, our strategic thinking, our whatever, our hearts are going to go in that direction. So it doesn't surprise me when I read about someone who's deconstructing who says, you know, I stopped reading the Bible and I stopped praying and I, after a while I stopped going to church and then I stopped hanging out with my Christian friends. And then I, and so I don't know, I just, it seems like, you know, it was easy to walk away from, well, Jesus said that about you. You, you are like a sheep and you're prone to wander. That is not a compliment. And that's all of us. And so that's why he gave us these ways to love him. Well, just like any relationship would, I mean, my wife has taught me over the last 30 years, better and better and better how to love her well. And I can choose not to do those things, but if I don't do them, I should expect my heart to draft, to drift from her. And I think anyone would say that's exactly what happens. So I'm not, I'm not surprised when people, if they say, I don't know how to grow closer to God. One, if they're, if that's authentic, man, what a fun conversation that would be. I think usually it's, if I say, really, you don't, like, what would you guess are some ways? And they start, well, I could pray, I could read his word, I could be around other Christians, and I could maybe do some of the Christian disciplines like fasting and silence and isolation and memorizing scripture. That sounds like a pretty good list. To be faithful with the things that we do know to do. And so if I want to have a closer relationship with my wife, it's going to need to start with the things I do know to do for her, that bless her and encourage her and draw us near to each other. I know that in the future, we're going to probably really soon in the future address. So what are reasons why people really do give for constructing their faith? But I think part of this goes back to what do you actually believe that you have? Like, do you actually believe you have the greatest treasure in the universe? That you actually have a meaning that this world can give you, or this satisfaction that isn't based on your circumstances, or a hope that can face anything? Like, you've got a right, because when you have that, I just feel like a lot of the reasons that people give for walking away from their faith or doubting it is they're like, well, but Christianity is all about God's mad at you, and he wants to send you to hell, and so if you don't accept Jesus, and it seems so external and non-relational, then all these other people that are happy following these other things, it looks like, well, who am I to say? It looks like they're finding God their own way, or they're happy in their own way. But part of it goes back to, but what do you actually believe that you have? Because in the book of the gal that you and I both know who wrote about that, she talked about, like, I mean, who am I to say that they're not? Like, you know, I'm trying to impose this thing on them, and it's like, but what do you actually believe that you have? Do you believe you have a relationship with the Creator of the universe that's made possible only through what Jesus did, and you really did deserve, you know, separation, or you had separation from God, but because of Jesus now that's restored? Like, is it this most meaningful thing in your life? Because if not, then... Yeah, of course, of course it'll be undermined by something, you know? There's a lot of fun ways to cope with life. There's a lot of pleasurable things that... Well, even just things that you don't, it's not like, well, I'm going to choose not to disagree with this person, and or affirm what they believe about marriage, or about gender, or about anything. I mean, really, and it's like, okay, well, if I don't hold a conviction about this, it's going to be a whole lot easier for me. And so, God doesn't want me to be at odds with other people, you know? At least that was what I had read. But it's one of those, do I love them enough to want to tell them about the greatest thing that could, you know, ever happen to them, or that would ultimately satisfy them longer than these things they're doing? Do I love them enough that I'm willing to even risk them not being happy with me to tell them of this joy that I found? Because if not, if I've just got this mundane ritualistic, this is what way I was raised, and this God is... I have this wrong view of God, then I don't have much to offer them. And why would I want to, you know? But it's just like, you keep going back to marriage. I'm a huge fan of marriage, because I really love marriage. And so, I can talk about marriage and the joys of it, or children, or things like that. But if I have a lousy marriage, I'm probably going to be cynical, or not a big fan, or kind of pessimistic about it. And so, it's the same thing where a lot of people that are deconstructing their faith, it's like, well, what did you even have? Did you have something that was like treasure, you know, like fulfilling? I don't know. Yeah, it's one of the intriguing things that it is... That we get to have a relationship with Him is based on Him and His love for us, that He loved us before we loved Him. And that's actually, again, was said many times, and we'll come back, that that's one of the, in many ways, distinctives of biblical Christianity. And yet, as C.S. Lewis, I think, points out correctly, he is, he's still a gentleman. It's pretty uncommon for God to be like forceful, I guess to say, overwhelming us. He rarely does that. He gives us the space, the invitation to be part of who He is, and to welcome us in. And He comes to us and invites us. In fact, that's one of my favorite pictures, is of the picture in Revelation, to cite from near where Chris was talking a minute ago, that we read all the time in a... Some people refer to it in a salvation way, that he stands at the door and knocks. But it's more than just, it's much bigger than just a salvation passage, a salvation concept, that he comes to our door, he comes to the door of our church, to the door of our home, to the door of our hearts, and he knocks. He came to us, but he still lets us open the door and let him in. We're still involved in the process of the relationship with him. And I think sometimes people think that they want him to do all the work, and he'll do almost all the work. And sometimes he will do all the work. He carries us around, sometimes completely. But we get to have a voice in that and a role in that. And so it shouldn't surprise us when we distance ourselves from him. He doesn't go anywhere. You don't know that old joke about the truck? Where you about to... Okay. So the old couples driving down the road to pickup truck, and the truck in front of them has some brand new young dating couple or whatever. And so of course, the guys, the boys sitting behind the wheel, and the girl is sitting as close to him. I'm now pantomiming this as though anyone can see this on the podcast. But it's sitting right up next to him. She snuggled up against him in the middle of the seat and whatever. And the old lady says, who's looking at this goes, how come we used to sit like that? And why don't we sit like that anymore? And the old man says, I haven't gone anywhere. I'm still the same spot. I haven't moved. I haven't moved the whole time. I think that's a great... as ridiculous as it is. That's a great picture of... I always imagine when someone says, I don't know. I just don't feel that close to God. I don't feel that the guy's like, I haven't gone anywhere. I am one prayer, one passage, one 30 minute period of silence away from you. And you're going to have to choose to accept that, to slide back closer. I'm still here. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not. Well, even in that revelation passage, he says, repent and do the things you did at first. You know what? You're exactly right. He says, go back and do those things. And at family camp, we had Craig Rochelle was speaking once and he was applying it to marriage, but it applies to everything else that we're talking about. He said, if you want what you once had, you must do what you once did. And if you want what you've never had, you must do what you've never done. So again, like you were saying, like if you want that closeness you used to have, well, what did you used to do? And then I still want to get closer. Well, so what are some things you've never done? Like, have you ever set aside time to cry or read the Bible or fast or, you know, have you served somewhere? All those things that can affect those things.
