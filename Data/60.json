We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legge, and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm not alongside any of my regular partners in crime, but I do have some friends, some ladies who are on staff with me here at South Spring. We have Kim Weber, Carly Manuel, and we have Mary Lee Knowles. Ladies thank you so much for being here today. Thanks for having us. Thanks for asking. Wonderful. We've kind of gone through different like series quote unquote what we've talked about on the podcast. Most recently we went through kind of a discussion of sexuality and sexual immorality and stuff like that in relation to deconstruction and what the Bible actually talks about and stuff like that. One thing that we're hoping to continue doing is just hearing people's stories of deconstruction and what we mean by that is okay, if you've had a crisis of faith or a big question that's kind of called your faith into question, how have you wrestled with that? Or maybe how have you seen other people wrestle with that? Or if you have friends or loved ones who've kind of walked through deconstruction and who do not believe anymore, how do you interact with them in an encouraging way? Not necessarily like how do you interact with them and be a friend? Not like that, but like specifically if you're thinking about faith related things and you're engaging with those conversations, how are you doing that? So that's kind of where we're at. So that's kind of the prompt for today. And so I'm going to throw it over to Kim to get our conversation going. But what did that prompt prompt in your brain? Yeah. So the first thing I kind of thought of was an experience where I don't know. I mean, if I would even reference this as deconstruction, but just was wrestling with, okay, how do I take in this new information in light of what I know that I believe about who God is? So I was a pretty new believer and I knew that I had faith in the Bible and I knew I had faith in Jesus, but I still was wrestling with things that felt very worldly or with friends. So sorry, let me get a little specific, but I was having a conversation with my sister who's also a believer and she was just, I don't remember how it came out, but she was talking about her church and how there was someone in her church who was seeking membership. And after talking with different members, the person's membership was essentially kind of denied, not that that person was denied from the church, but the membership was denied because he was actively without repentance walking in a homosexual lifestyle. And that conversation had gone back and forth and it had been for over several months with several people. And there were times where he was like, no, I want to be all into the church. I understand that this is not right, but he was still wrestling with that himself. So anyway, that was happening at her church. I wasn't involved. I didn't know all the details, but when she told me this, it was really unsettling because I had come from a very, come from a more liberal background. And so I had a lot of experience with people I loved deeply who had a lot, who lived a lot of lifestyles that you wouldn't find very common in the Christian church or things that we would call sin when people are aware of and are able to repent from these things, from these sins. Can I interrupt you real quick? Were those people members of a church still? Like were they members of a church? No, the people that I'm talking about are not Christian by any respect. I just didn't know if that was also like, oh, this didn't really add up in my mind or something like that. No, that's a great clarification. No, these are just people that I loved and had walked life with when I was a believer in Jesus, but knew nothing about theology. So I wasn't relating to them to Christianity. All that was a me thing. And I was, I was in a state of, oh, good, whatever's good for you is good for you. That's awesome. But as I was learning more about scripture, it felt tugging at my heart or like almost irresponsible to then walk into the world and have my same opinions that I had before I knew Jesus or before I knew scripture, I knew Jesus. I didn't know what he taught about a lot of things. I didn't know what God believed and wanted for us, wanted best for us. And so anyway, she told me these things and I had this, it felt like that deconstruction tug because I didn't want to just buck against my sister and say, no, that's wrong. How could your church do that? Cause something inside of me, the Holy Spirit was saying, well, maybe that's not right, but I don't know enough and I don't know how to have this conversation with you. So I was like, Hey, I need to go pray about this, look at scripture about this. But it really bothered me. And I had to, I studied a lot of scripture after that. And I texted my sister. I said, Hey, send me some of the references and things that your church is using as reasons to deny membership. And she reaffirmed to me like, we are walking with that person still and we are walking with them. But to be a member of this church, we believe that you need to acknowledge your sins, acknowledge that Jesus is enough to cover your sins, repent of those things and walk in newness of life. And I think it just really was a struggle for me because really a lot of what y'all have been talking about on your homosexuality series and sexuality series about like, okay, well, I don't know, is this a natural thing? Is it just whatever else? Like those were the things that I was tugging against. But the more that I dug into it, the more I realized like, okay, like you guys are talking about in the podcast, it's like my foundation is on Christ. That next level to understand what I believe my worldview then needs to be the Bible. And so if I get to a point where I encounter something in this world where I don't know fully what to believe, like I need to consult the Bible if that's what I believe. Like I think where deconstruction can go off the rails is when you just start to think like you keep thinking or you keep consulting people that might not be in the word or things like that. So anyway, that's what came to mind when you asked that question. That's good. How old were you when that was kind of when you were a restaurant? 22. Okay. Yeah, it was after college. Okay. Yeah. I got you. So putting you all on the spot, but do you, when do you feel like, and anyone can answer this first, but when, when did you feel like your faith became your faith? For me, a lot of it was like college choosing like, okay, well, am I gonna, am I gonna go to church? And then why am I gonna go to church? And why do I actually believe these things? So I grew up in like a, my parents were missionaries. So like we, we did these things and I just grew, grew up going to church and, you know, being involved in ministry, not giving it much of a second thought. And so there were times in college for me that were like, have I just been doing, like, have I just been doing this just for the sake of doing it? Is this just a, my, my family thing? And that kind of felt really unsettling for me of like, is this real? Yeah. You know, kind of a thing. I don't, I don't know, Mary lead, maybe you, I can throw it over to you first. For sure. So I grew up in a church and was baptized as a toddler. And I came to know the Lord my going into my freshman year of high school. But there was not really any like discipleship or like spiritual growth at that point. I'd say I was a believer, but I didn't know what that meant. You know, I like, my life was relatively easy. I didn't go through many trials or anything. And it wasn't until my freshman year of college where I was on my own. And I think the thing that really brought me to truly being a disciple of the Lord was all of the things that I had held onto as identity throughout my whole life in high school, like going into college, like I was the smart one. I was all of these things and being a Christian was kind of one of those things on the list. All of those things that I had clung to as identity got stripped away from me. Just because I went to a really competitive college and I was no longer the big fish in the small pond. You know, I was like, Oh gosh, who am I anymore? Like now that I'm on my own, what are the things that I'm choosing to value? Like what are the things that will define my life? And that's kind of where I came to a realization like, Oh, like the Lord is it like the Lord is the most important thing in my life. Like only through the Lord and by the Holy Spirit, am I able to do anything. And so that was really the pivotal point in my life. And so it was re-baptized at that point. Okay. Very cool. So I guess, so you went to UT, correct? I did. And did you study political science? I did. I studied government and minored in religious studies. Was there any difficulty with your faith maybe being called into question at all, going to a school in Austin and then studying politics? Did you feel like that was unsettling for your faith at times? Did you feel like not really? Or did you feel like it was more affirming in some ways? Kind of all three, to be honest. There were some, obviously UT is like a more liberal school, but I feel like at UT, I met the people that have been the most on fire for the Lord my whole life. There's something I think really sweet and refreshing. And I would encourage any Christian who like is in the Bible belt and everyone they know is Christians, like at some point in your life, surround yourself with non-believers or surround yourself with people who are not just like Christian culture Christians. Because I think that's what we see. And I feel like we all see this in Tyler and in Texas and wherever of like, and it's kind of the family and culture I grew up into of like, we celebrated the holidays, we've valued Christian morality and Christian ethics, but like, what was the relationship with the Lord like? And I think being in a culture, in an environment where nobody cared, nobody cared what my morals were. I was not judged if you could have done whatever you want, drink or curse or anything like that. You know? And so that was a really cool way that I was able to reorient my faith and kind of put like the most important things first and not just like the Christian practices and like going to church on Sunday. Like if I skipped church on a Sunday, nobody cared. That was not a thing that everyone around me valued. Okay. That's really interesting. Okay. I'm going to switch gears. I'm going to throw it over to you Carly, because I know just from being on staff and hearing, I don't know exactly when, but just hearing like that you've experienced a lot of close friends who you love walking away from faith. What did the initial prompt, where did that take you? Is it more personal? Is it more relational? And kind of where does that go? Yeah. When I first heard you talk, you bring up the subject of deconstruction or when I hear anyone talk about it, typically the first place I go is thinking about close friends, specifically from college who have walked away from the faith. And up until college, I honestly didn't have a lot of close Christian community. I oftentimes was the only believer in my circles leading up until college, specifically thinking about like my high school, I was the only believer in my friend group. And even before that, so college was the first time I had a Christian community that was really formative and consistent and beautiful. And then shortly after college was when a lot of those close friends started to walk away from the faith. And there are so many different factors, I think, that play into that. And I think deconstruction and how people come along to deconstructing their faith, especially in the last few years, it's just so varied. Sometimes it's because of what happened with 2020 and COVID and just like people seeing just terrible things in our world and like deciding that they're not going to choose to have hope anymore. Or sometimes it's, okay, we got out of the Christian bubble that we were in, and we reentered into a new environment. A lot of my friends from college, they moved to different countries around the world, and they were in a totally different culture and decided that the Christian faith was more like specific to our culture in America. And that's not what they wanted to keep going with. So there's so many different, I think, reasons for why people choose to deconstruct their faith. And I know you mentioned earlier when we were talking before this started about how it's important to deconstruct in a way so that we can rebuild our theology and our foundations and our thoughts about faith on what is true and not just maybe what we grew up with or what we've been surrounded by. But when I think of deconstruction, I think more of specifically people that they say, oh, at a time in my life, I claimed to believe this, and now I no longer hold that to be true at all. Do you feel like some of those people, do they want to believe in Christianity and they just feel like they can't? Or do you feel like it's like, oh, this is an opportunity to not. And so I think a lot of them, they would want to or like to believe in God or like the idea of God, but specifically, yeah, higher power, but specifically when it comes to things in Christianity that confront culture today, that is where I think a lot of them have decided, okay, this draws the line. Like a lot of them care about, yeah, just things that the culture cares about today. And it doesn't align with what the Bible says in a lot of ways. And so they've decided to go more with culture than truth. Yeah. Do you talk with a lot of those people still? For sure I do. But it's not at the intimate level that we used to, it's not as often, whereas I used to be like an insider, now I'm an outsider in those circles. And it's hard because we're all spread out. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it's people from high school, people from college, people from, you know, even the last couple of years. Yeah. Okay. So you're saying, you were also saying that you were kind of the only Christian in your friend group, even in high school. Did you feel like the, did that make it easier? Like to transit, like, did you feel like from an early age, your faith was kind of your own in that way? So did you, did you wrestle with things at an early age? Yes. I honestly, um, that's a good question. I think just honestly, by the grace and goodness of God, I have not really had a season that was devastatingly confronting my faith. Just small, maybe along the way questions of, I know as a, as a young person, um, one of the things I struggled with was I, I became a believer at the age like four or five. I do not have a lot of specific memories about that. And so one of the first things I had to confront as I started to learn more about like what it meant to even share your testimony and like, incorporate that into evangelism. I had to confront like, Oh, I can't not, I cannot tell you the day I was saved. Like how important is that in my testimony? And, um, a lot of reasons why that was a struggle was because I thought that my salvation had a lot more to do with me than, than actually what Jesus has done for me. And so as I grew in maturity and faith, was able to say, Oh yeah, like it's okay that I don't remember the day I was saved. The Lord does. And I can point back to specific moments in my early childhood where I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit and guiding me and, and, and evidence of my faith and my works based off of my faith that proved that. But yeah, as, um, a young kid and, and middle school and high school, I think being the only believer in my circles in a lot of ways strengthened my faith because it taught me very, very early on in my life that my purpose is to treat every environment that I'm in as my mission field. Um, and so even as early as like seventh grade, I can have memories of looking at around at my peers and thinking like, okay, this is my mission field. Like, how am I going to present? Um, the gospel today, um, with my life. So I think, I don't know. I think a lot of people are scared in the Bible belt to like go out into different environments where they are the only believer. Um, but I think that it's also really beautiful what you can see like God do in those environments. Yeah. And that kind of reminded me of what you were just saying, Mary Lee of like being surrounded by somebody who thinks differently than you do. I think those are, I think those are good and it can kind of be, if, if you have grown up in a place where you feel like you have not been challenged, then you can kind of go into areas where you are being challenged sort of on shaky ground because you're like, okay, have I just believed this because the people around me have believed this. And so, yeah, is my identity rooted in something else, you know, or is it rooted in this? Um, you all did the Forge program, correct? So the Forge, if you're not familiar with it, is a, it's a program kind of leadership based kind of, I know right now they're, they're mantras kind of like, is it faith worth following? And so, um, I'm sure that there are a lot of moments from that. It's like a nine month program at a, at a local camp here in East Texas. Um, but basically like, were there instances from a discipleship program in your life that were like, this was good because I was challenged in X or Y. And if there's nothing, then I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm definitely putting you on the spot. If you're like, we're straying from the topic, we can kind of bring it back. I think the Forge for me, wasn't super like theology challenging. It was a ton of personal growth and personal development. But I think as far as like deconstructing, reconstructing faith, I did a lot of that in college. Okay. Gotcha. Same for y'all. Would you say that? Yes. But I think that there are, I feel like I can look back at that season of life, which was about five years ago for me and Kim and know that there are so many things that have come up in the last four years that I am so much quicker to be able to respond to, um, based off of truth scripture and just wisdom and discernment because we kind of already confronted all of those things in that year. Can I put you on the spot and ask if there's anything that comes to mind? Yes. Um, I, I mean, even thinking about like we had a class about specifically evangelism, like thinking about the class that, um, Chris shared, which if you're listening to this podcast, you probably have heard who Chris shared is, but he taught one of our classes and, um, there are things from his class that I feel like I had never heard before. And I'm trying to think of like specifics. I don't know if there are any specifics coming into your mind of what's in there, but there are things that they're thinking about. Like of like thinking about, um, post modern era that we're in and like having an understanding of where Christianity Christianity is today, where we're going, um, has been helpful in this season, but I, yeah, I don't know if there's anything very specific. I mean, there's nothing for me. I mean, I'm also trying to think of specific things in our forge year. I know there were several people that did wrestle with deconstruction. Um, and it was hard because I feel like if we walked into the forge and you had that development of like, Hey, I don't know what I don't know, or I might've thought wrongly about the things in the past, but like Jesus, my foundation, the Bible is my foundation. Like, I don't know. That's how I was, was like, just teach me things. Just keep throwing things at my brain. Let me understand. So that way I'm equipped in eight months when we leave this program to know what these things are. So like, I'm like, fill up my database, whatever. There are some people who walked in and I think hadn't faced some of these deconstructing things had never maybe even thought critically about some of these topics. I mean, like I can imagine some of the listeners to this podcast are coming into certain episodes being like, whoa, I don't know if I'm ready to listen to that topic. Cause I haven't thought critically about it. Um, and so I think there were some people that when it was a fire hydrant of like, we're talking about the Holy Spirit now. And we're talking about this topic of theology. Um, it kind of rattled them a little bit and they were forced to like step back and be like, I don't know that I believe that, but I don't know what I believe. And I, I think it was, even though it was a healthy environment to deconstruct because there were so many people to support you, so many awesome theological leaders, a lot of like wisdom and leadership, I think it was also probably a hard place to deconstruct if you hadn't before, just because it was a fire hydrant of information. So it's like, you might be like, I'm going to step away from this topic and then you get pelted with other theologically deep topics. And so I saw some people that I know in the forge in our year and other years after just kind of wrestle with that type of environment. But I think it goes to like, again, everyone's going to be so different whether you grew up and you were saved at four or like me, I was saved somewhere in my college years and wrestled with things after college, like whether you need to leave the Bible bubble that you were in and go into a more secular zone. I think it's just so dependent on who you are. And that's why I love that you're even bringing on different voices now because we all have the three of us have completely different stories. Yeah. Yeah. So kind of going back then to, okay, you guys have, whether you've gone through deconstruction or in a way deconstructed your faith and what you believe and then have rebuilt, you probably have, I mean, I know that some of you for sure have friends who have deconstructed and walked away. And Carly kind of hit on this earlier. What have been some specifics of what you've heard of like, this has been like a big item for somebody to say, like, you know what, this, I don't, I don't like this. And then they've walked away. Can you do any of those come to mind as like, these are really big things that people are struggling with. And maybe they're like, people actually want to have dialogue about it. And it's like, people actually don't. Yeah. So I don't know what comes to your mind, Mary Lee, you're nodding. A few different things really. I think homosexuality is a big one that I helped girls walk through in college. Not even girls who are struggling with same sex attraction, but just girls who are struggling to reconcile. Like if God is loving, this seems unloving. You know, and I even had friends who were believers say, if I could change anything about Christianity, it would be homosexuality. Like the Bible's view of homosexuality. And I think that's just a hard thing. And I think those were girls who were mature in their faith and like were submitting to scripture as truth. But they were like, this is just something that's hard. And I think also, I mean, the three of us are women, like did a lot of walking through like the Bible in God's view of women and what that means. And I think, I think of one conversation I had with a girl specifically who like she even admitted, she was like, I just feel defensive when I read scripture about women. You know, um, that's really interesting. Yeah. And I think it's a lot of like, we bring our own cultural understandings into our Bible reading, which partly is unavoidable just because like our understanding of the world shapes everything. Um, but yeah, I went to a really healthy church in college and we studied through first Peter and the part about why submitting with their husbands. After that, I led a small group through my church in college. And after that, I got so many texts like, Hey, want to meet for coffee this week. I'd love to talk to some things with you. Wow. Yeah. And so I think were those like, were those good conversations? Do you feel like a lot of them were? Yeah. Okay. A lot of them were like girls. I was already had relationships with them already discipling. Okay. And a lot of girls just come into me humbly of like, I don't understand this and I want to. Um, but then I did have, I knew some people who were like, defend yourself kind of, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Very cool. You were, you were, you were saying kind of a, from a liberal background. What do you, what do you feel like as far as people that you've known, have they been kind of from that liberal background who have deconstructed and kind of walked away? Not necessarily. I was going to say there's like different things. Like this isn't even necessarily on the deconstructing zone, but I still have an audience with a lot of my friends from college and um, get to engage with them and, um, have good conversations about the faith. Um, and so, but it's hard because they're not believers. So it's not really deconstructing, but I get to see what are their barriers to even listening to me? What are their barriers to faith and where are their preconceived notions about faith? And a lot of it I've seen is really like, and I know Chris is big on this on, uh, sorry, Chris leg on words and definitions, but really just misdefinition. Like when I get the chance to actually, like when someone on social media that I was deep friends with in college will engage with me. Um, and a lot of them would consider themselves very left-wing politically, very anti-Christianity because they think it's hateful. Um, a lot of them, once I explain, no, it's not really about this issue. It's more about like how I'm defining life or how I'm defining identity. Like here's where I get my identity from. And that's why even in this, like, uh, it's not a debate. It's not an argument. Even this conversation, this dialogue, um, I'm not going to be torn down by the words you're saying. I get to engage practically. And so I don't know. I feel like that's not necessarily deconstruction, but just a lot more meat, like getting to show them that not all Christians are what they perceive as hateful or they perceive as whatever. But I was going to say, um, things, people that I've seen who have deconstructed, um, sometimes it centers around judgment and like perceived judgment that they have once they start to see things about sin. And I, I don't know, part of me thinks that's the Holy Spirit convicting them of their sin and they don't like it. It feels icky. Like being a believer is difficult. Sanctification is God's will for our lives, but it is not meant to be easy. It is icky and difficult and seeing our sins is icky, especially if we have the Holy Spirit because God does not like our sins. And so we're going to feel that same ickiness that he feels about them. And so, but that I think people conflate those verses about like, don't fully understand things in scripture that we read about judgment and other things. And so, um, some people that I've seen walked away, it just has felt too heavy for them, um, and too much. And I don't know what the cause of that is. I don't know if they dove in too quickly, if they have a lot of church hurt, like I don't know what that is, but that has really pained me and hurt me when people have either taken a step back and then have a more watered down faith or have just walked away entirely because they just can't handle it. And people out there, people outside of Christianity, um, seem more loving. Um, and so that's been some of the sadder people, like experiences I've had with people walking away. Interesting. Interesting. Anything, anything come to mind for you, Carly, as far as specifics, I know you mentioned, I know you mentioned, I mean, even in 2020 of like things coming up and that might've even stirred in people's hearts of like, yeah, I just, I just think back to one of my really good friends in college. And I think he just had been very poorly churched. And then that just kind of led to like, oh, I mean, this kind of, I like the concept of this. It's just really, really hard. I mean, the first thing that came to my mind was when people come to this realization, um, based off of experiences that they have had in their lives, where out of all the people in their lives, when they needed people the most, Christians weren't the ones to come to the rescue or they weren't the people there for them or when they had questions, they were met with like confrontation. Um, yeah. So yeah, I don't know. Like when they think about the most loving people, they don't think about Christians. They don't put them into that category. That's an interesting point. Yeah. Just kind of carrying on. And not to say that that's, there are many, many, many faithful believers that are loving people well. But I think it's hard when you hear people that are on the outside of like your Christian bubble or your community that aren't believers and what they perceive is believers are not loving them well, or, or people that don't fit into maybe like their community. Yeah. Which is so hard as like a friend who's a believer too, because there are moments where I'm like, I know the thing I'm about to say, or the thing I'm about to do, or the way that I'm going to intervene is might not seem loving. And there are some times where you can, you can skirt around things a little bit and it's still like you're being a faithful witness because you want, you don't want to lose that, that person, you don't want that person to lose you as a confidant because you want to have influence in their life. But there are some moments where I've had to like, there's nothing, there's no other way I can respond to this. And then they walk away from you. And that's when it gets really like soul crushing of like, I was actually doing something more loving than that other person. But you have the right to choose, you have the right to choose Jesus or not. You have the right to choose your community or not. You have the right to choose what path, what worldview you're choosing. Yeah. Yeah. And, and it's hard to, when I think this happens a lot in our, in our current culture is if you're not willing to affirm. Yes. And then, and so it's like, where we believe like, hey, we can, we can love and then also bring the truth of the Bible with that. And that might be in conflict with what you say that you're grounding your life on or something. The, the difficulty I feel like comes when you're like, okay, look, I don't believe what you're doing is right. According to the Bible is like, well, then, then you hate me if you cannot affirm what I believe. And that, that can get tricky relationally. Yeah. I know. Is there anything that comes, comes to your mind, Mary Lee of like what they were saying about maybe a lack of empathy or perceived empathy from the, you know, from the church at large people who are outsiders who are looking for help or something like that? I don't know. Yeah. I think I had a few thoughts. I think with what Kim was saying, something I have thought about and wrestled through is like people who like, and this is essentially the parable of the seeds of like people who come to know the Lord and then realize like, Oh, my life is not getting any easier. In fact, it is just getting harder. And I came to the Lord thinking he was just like another treatment for my anxiety and it's not working, you know, or like, I thought this was the good life and like life is not good. Life is harder, you know? And I think that's just like a, life is, yeah, life is still hard. It's not easy. And now I'm being asked to do all these things and give up the comforts that I had before, you know? And so, yeah, what you had said just made me think about that. And I think that's where discipleship is so important because it's, you need older believers to be like, okay, this is normal. Here's how we go through it, you know? Yeah. And then I think with what Carly was saying, something that was convicting to me is I think even oftentimes when like Christians do do loving things, like Christians like, provide meals or like provide services and then immediately follow with like, come to church. It almost like immediately discredits it. It just was like, Oh, this was like sleazy salesman. Now, you're only being loving because you want me to join your club or whatever, you know? Interesting. But I think there's such a fine line between like the most loving thing we can do for someone is to tell them the truth, you know? And like, we know that the truth, scripture says that the truth will set you free. Like the truth is good and it's exactly what we need at all times. But when people are weary and downtrodden and discouraged, sometimes they just need like practical love. But I don't know. I mean, this is something that all believers should wrestle with. The first thing that I thought of talking about this specifically is the book, The Gospel Comes with a House Key and thinking about when we love others. And I think I can think of a lot of people in our community that do this well. So when I say these things, it's not like I'm trying to, I don't know, speak negatively of my Christian community. But yeah, when we are trying to love others, specifically those that might be deconstructing or that do not identify with being a Christian or a believer, when we try to love those people, are we inviting them to our dinner tables or are we inviting them to our program? And if they don't feel like they belong at our table, at our home, then they're probably not going to want to get involved with other things. And I think that is like a good place to start or even a question to ask yourself is like, would this person feel welcome at my dinner table, even if the conversations we're having at that dinner table are me confronting something in truth and love and saying, nope, I believe something different. Like they're going to receive that a lot differently at the dinner table than they are when they're sitting in a pew listening to a sermon.
