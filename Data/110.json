We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. In today's episode, we're talking about purity culture, deconstructing that, but I'm not going to be the one to intro that. I'm going to throw it over to Brent, not just because you're a woman. But well, the reason why is because I feel like you were the first person to bring it up and then you've done significant research on this and have really great perspective. And so I'm going to throw that over to you to get our conversation rolling. Yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, so we kind of had to through this idea around a while ago, but I think I wanted to do some more research and make sure that it was connected with, you know, the goal of our podcast and all of that just to really serve our listeners well. And the more that I dug into it, the more that I began to see that there is a lot of there are a lot of links between purity culture and purity culture gone wrong and people deconstructing a lot of different aspects of their faith or all of their faith. And so we'll define a lot of that. But for that reason, I felt like it was really helpful to cover because I even found some testimonies online this weekend of people saying like purity culture is the reason that I'm not a Christian anymore, which is crazy. And, but I grew up like pretty much in the heart of it, maybe at the end of purity culture, but I didn't. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. Well, I was just gonna say, as because we care about defining terms, right? Can I can I interrupt you and ask you what you mean about purity? And I'm assuming that probably a lot of our listeners know what that means. Yeah, but I don't and you know how definitions are everyone kind of totally and so and then I know we had mentioned the beginning. So maybe you kind of share yours, Chris, you kind of talk a little bit about about that and maybe kind of the timeframe of like, when did this come about? And then we can kind of go from there. Is that okay? Sure. Yeah. And that's great because Chris and I are different generations. Can I say that? I know. It's like, oh, this is gonna be good. See how she handles this tactically. I'm old, you're not. Generations. My understanding of purity culture is that it was primarily really a strong movement in the evangelical church in the 90s. And a lot of it was the heart of it was trying to promote godly purity and holiness and relationships and abstinence before marriage. And promote was trying to promote really good things as far as living a pure life as a Christian young person. And a lot of it came from people who I think parents who had been a part of the sexual revolution prior to that and trying to lead their families in a way that was different and counter cultural. So in a lot of ways probably had good roots. And then like anything can was twisted in a lot of ways by many people, whether out of ignorance or just misunderstanding. And it became something that was really legalistic in some ways in some aspects. And I want to say that because I know that not all of the movement was bad. There are aspects of it that were really biblical. You know, we'll unpack that. But became for a lot of people a legalism or even like a prosperity gospel of if you live this way, then God will give you XYZ when it comes to your relationships and your sexuality. And then even tied to identity as far as like if you're lived this way, then you're pure and holy as a Christian and kind of those messages. And then even the extreme of that being misused as far as like abuse and authority and all of that. So there's like a lot of different aspects of the way that it played out and looked, but primarily was just a movement in the evangelical church promoting purity and abstinence. So, Chris, what would you add or change from that definition? Man, I think you nailed that. I think it was a reaction in the evangelical churches in particular, but not just evangelical churches, but a reaction to the sexual revolution and what that had turned into in America. And I think I have said before, I think it really comes down to this, that the world began to teach constantly, rabidly, with every opportunity, pushing the message that sex is common. It's not special. It's not. There's nothing extraordinary about it. It's just a thing. You know, animals do it. Bugs do it. Everything does it. It's just not a big deal. And we need to stop treating it like it's a big deal. And everyone does it. Is that what you would consider in brief what the sexual, what came from the sexual revolution? Yes. Is that? Yeah. That was the sexual revolution is based on, without going into too much detail, Freud came to the opinion that the highest and greatest experience of humanity was genital sex. And so anything that limits that, anything that takes from that, anything that in any way restricts that is therefore a human evil. And so it's bad to limit someone's ability to engage in sex however they want to, whenever they want to. And so a huge energy, a huge amount of energy was put into solving any consequences of sex. So how do we solve the biological consequences so that there aren't any? How do we create a pill or other ways to make sure that pregnancy is not a consequence, that there aren't any diseases as a consequence? And of course we know that in many ways this blew up in our face and that actually what finally began to ratchet down the sexual revolution a little bit at least was actually more diseases. That's what put a big slowdown in it. But the church's effort to respond to this unfortunately did not do a good job of saying, of correcting with something positive. Oh, it was like sex is bad. Sex is bad. And so the biblical response, and if you go back and read the writings, in many cases, they really did do this. They said, no, no, it's not that sex is common or bad, it's that sex is sacred, sex is special, and it's meant to be saved. That's why the message, I mean, I was there year one of true love waits, which was kind of the first, one of the first big movements. And notice the name of it is true love waits. It's not, you know, wait so God will love you more. It's not don't have sex so that, you know, whatever it was. If you really love the key people in your life, especially the person you're dating, the person you want to marry someday, a true expression of love is abstaining from engaging sexually. And so it was the mindset, what originally was great. But like Bryn said, what it very quickly became, and most probably most students experience was essentially not that sex, the response to sex is common, became sex is bad. And people who want to have sex are bad. And people who do have sex, especially outside of marriage are bad. And those were the messages over and over again was, it became very fear based. It became, it was really a return to kind of the Jewish shame and fear model when it came to conforming. And so you conform to the community of the church, or you will be shamed. And it's a fear based motivation, which of course turned into not don't do it, but don't get caught doing it. And so anyway, it created all kinds of issues that slowly built. So I was there at the beginning of it, probably Bryn, if you were experiencing it, you were experiencing it edits, kind of its apex, good and bad. Probably you were probably at that when it probably started mostly a downhill spiral. It was pretty tame. You did once a year, you did a true love weights thing. And the silver ring thing. Yeah, that was the purity ring was a part of the true love weights. And it was very much so a family thing, like, you know, a daughter, a son would say, you know, I'm gonna wait till I'm married. And the parents would buy them a ring that that is a reminder that you've chosen to wait. Right? It was really kind of beautiful. And it's own and a lot of times it really was. Yeah, like, because we, that's what I was gonna say is like, we did that in our family. But I think one of the reasons that I didn't think to cover this for so long was because I didn't experience a lot of the really negative, you know, unhealthy or controlling or whatever aspects of it. And so I didn't even realize it was linked to a lot of these things until I was older, you know. Well, so now that we've talked about maybe some of its origins, can we can we kind of talk a little bit about how, how it strayed from that and then how what it kind of has become for people? Yeah, I think that's great. You want me to start or you? Yeah, yeah. Go for it. Yeah, so I think that's a great question. And yeah, Chris, that gives a lot of extra context. My understanding even from talking with friends and even reading a lot of things about, you know, people's testimony and different things. My understanding is that, like Chris is saying it, it became, it's like we lost the really healthy theology and the really beautiful aspects of what it was trying to accomplish. And in addition to being kind of a knee-jerk reaction, it also began to kind of twist theology. And so some of the aspects of core theology that, that I think got twisted. And when I say like, like I said, this wasn't everyone's experience, this wasn't the case. In extreme cases, we're not making blanket statements, but in extreme cases for those that were like really harmful, I think to people, that theology that was twisted primarily and then we can talk about other aspects of it. But was like Chris is saying, the theology of sex and what it is and what the purpose is was an aspect of it. Another aspect of it, like I mentioned earlier, was identity. So it became a behavior modification where if you, like I have, it's so heartbreaking, but I have heard so many girls say particularly, and I'm sure men have similar experiences too, but girls particularly, that it became an identity where it's like, this is what you're called to, if you don't do it, then you are XYZ. So like all these analogies that were used primarily in the purity culture movement of like, if you have had sex or if you've been sexually active and you're not married, it's like you're a flower that's had its petals crushed, you're like a piece of gum that's been chewed up, there's like the analogy of like the spit cup that's been passed around, just like really horrific images, tape that's no longer sticky, like all this stuff that I've read over and over again about women who were like, that was what was told to me if I have sex. And so it was communicating a behavior that was attempting to like live for the Lord, but then became an identity where it's like antithetical to the gospel because the gospel doesn't say like, oh do this, this, and this, and then you'll be holy and pure. It's that, no, Christ has done this for you, so you get to accept the identity of holiness and purity, and then you get to live that out in freedom, and you get to live that out to honor him, not that then somehow you can lose that or somehow you can, and so it became like an identity for so many of these girls, and I think it's like what you're saying, it became, and men too, I'm sure so many young men experienced this as well. It really though did target women. It really did. I mean, it was, yeah, I agree with you, yes, but the damage that was done to men was more, in my opinion, it was men are just kind of animals in heat, and men aren't going to be pure because they're men, so it's the girl's job to keep the relationship pure because he isn't going to, and so the message of that was to men, you're essentially animal and animal in heat, like you can't control yourself, and so that was such a, I don't know, helpless, creating a sense of helplessness, that message constantly coming at us, and it was so divisive between men and women, young men and young women, that men are essentially predators. They've like set them against each other. Yes, and well, and then, and I'm sure you're going to get to this, Bryn, but I feel like then a lot in evangelical and church settings, then you get into the idea from identity is like modesty, and those conversations that it's like coming from a place that we hope is, you know, trying to care for people ends up not caring for people. Right, well, it just becomes all interconnected, so I feel like the purity movement had so many offshoots from that like theology that was mistaught, and so yeah, like you're saying, it affected how we talk about modesty, how we talk about our bodies, like Chris is talking about, it even came between men and women and set them against each other and made women the like, almost like gave them a victim mentality of like, oh, you have to constantly be on guard against these predators, because all men care about is sex. Right, and so even changing like that whole narrative, and like Chris is saying, kind of took responsibility away from men to like control their own bodies, but even like change the narrative of, you know, what it means to be a godly man. And so I think part of the really harmful aspect is the goal was like to promote godliness in relationships before and after marriage, but what happened was it changed identity and, you know, misplaced the conversations about sexuality. And so then when all these couples got married, they had all this, all these lies that had been fed to them, some even being like, if you abstain and save yourself, then God will reward you with awesome sex, and all of your sexual temptations will be resolved in marriage, and you'll never have to be pure again, because marriage will fix it, you know, and so it just, yeah, it gives it, it then not only changes the theology of sex, it changes the theology of marriage. Right, and then I'm sure. And the theology of sin, and the theology of redemption. This was what killed me was when you said that, Bryn, I've heard from from several, especially women, men too, but especially women, was when you said like a, you know, like a flower that's been trampled, like a, you know, a tape that's lost in stickiness, whatever, is the fun, your fundamental value as a person came from your sexual status and experience, and you were only as valuable as your lack of sexual experience, because the statement was made all the time, who would want someone like this? Right. Who would want someone who's had these experiences? Who would want, and it was just a horrific presentation, and really traumatizing and brutal. I mean, well, and I think, I know that it was like very praised as well to be a virgin and to only marry a virgin. Right. And I don't, I think that was another thing that was like added to the shame side of things. Yeah. And so it's like, does that make sense? Yes. Which it's like, like I said at the beginning, there, there are aspects of it that are godly and biblical of like, yeah, if you and your spouse end up being able to both, you know, be virgins when you get married, like that is not a bad thing. Right. Great. Yeah. So there's a lot of like, really, like we've talked about a lot on this podcast, a lot of healthy places that it started or promoted, but then just became twisted in so many examples. And I'm sure Chris has seen in marriage counseling, like it didn't promote healthy Christian marriages. And there are so many couples that I have heard about or talked to or read about who ended up divorced because it set them up for such an unhealthy version of so many things in their marriage and promised so many things that, and gave each them a view of each other that still set them against each other in marriage, that it just tore down marriages, even if they did abstain until they got married. Yeah. Chris, you have Oh, gosh. Yeah. I mean, that message of, um, uh, like that, that it's all going to work out because you waited. Um, I mean, it's just, it's just not true. It's not biblically sound. Like you said, it's a version of health and wealth teaching, um, how destructive when, you know, Hey, we, we were awesome. And then it turns out he has a pornography addiction or she does. And, and it's like, and that's now that's going to go away because now we're married and all of our sexual hang ups and bad feelings and trauma and all that kind of stuff will be fixed by being married. Of course we know that's, you know, that does not the common experience. So and their sexuality and their body, and then you get married and expect them to just be fine and be like, great having sex with their husband. And it's like, well, that's, that's a big switch when you've never even touched them until your wedding day. Yeah. And, and you believe that all they care about is sex. Right. Yeah. You've been taught that they're just sexual animals and that they have no, they're animals in heat and they have no self-control. And so the reason they married you was to have sex with you because that's all they're going to value in you anyway, because obviously they're not going to value you if you have had any sexual experience. And so, and so it must be sexuality. That's how men apparently evaluate women. It's just the level of, I don't know, secondary tertiary consequences was, was just shocking. And, and I agree with you. I don't know that anyone intended it. I mean, other than Satan, I don't know that anyone intended it. I just think, you know, even, even the fact, you know, we were talking about earlier about the idea of, you know, the I kiss dating goodbye guy and that this became a, literally there became a theology of dating. Yeah. Dating is not mentioned in the Bible. It's a culturally contextual thing. And so people suddenly began to create this like, Oh no, if you date people, it's shameful. You must not really trust God. If you're dating people, you must not believe in the bill. Cause clearly what the Bible tells us to do is just to court people and blah, blah, blah. And, and it wasn't a biblical thing. They were trying to pull, I don't know, the 1860s romantic era of the South and call it biblical. And so, and, and to create all these things, some of which may have had some wisdom or tact involved, you know, I mean, God forbid a girl call a guy, right? During the purity movement. Cause obviously the Bible says the girls don't call guys. Um, I don't remember where it says that. I just, I just know it must say it somewhere. Um, the girls don't go to the threshing room floor and lie down and make themselves available. Um, that doesn't happen in the Bible. The one romantic story we have anyway, sorry, sorry, bitterness got toned down the bitterness. Um, the, uh, he's referring to the story of Ruth, of Ruth and Boaz where that exact thing happens. Sorry. The one romantic story we have in the Bible, which, in which the woman does communicate clearly her availability to the man. But anyway, um, it's a, it's, it was just so broken and it became like back to another podcast we had about the Bible and this was a great example of the dangers of the Bible and the Bible and our cultural preferences. And they began to be linked and taught constantly in the church. Um, in certain churches and it just, it just got out of hand. It feels like like it went from this something that had some real positive, good reminders to kids about sexual purity. And it turned into for some people, um, yeah, a real problem. Bryn, was there any, any other aspects of like, oh, this kind of came from this or whatever that you wanted to highlight? Well, I think, um, I, and we've talked, I mean, we've done several episodes on like, is the Bible sexist? I think we've done several on sexuality and God's plan for sexuality. And there's a great book out about it. Chris, and his son Mark just wrote a book called Sex and Marriage that covers a lot of this, like the theology of sex. And, um, and like, I've heard him teach it multiple times at this point, and it's just so restorative for people who, um, yeah, I have, have been under the influence of a lot of these teachings and just very healthy for marriages and even dignity for women. Um, and just, yeah, even, and I'm sure dignity for men understanding, like being able to explain how men view their wives and just like, anyway, so many healthy things. So sex and marriage by Chris and Mark leg, Amazon, Amazon it, but, um, but, but I think, um, Christian Colson, I think the extreme of this, which we may cover later, but I have seen a lot is that it was used, um, abuse simply. So like, definitely some good aspects of it. Some people who just, you know, some middle ground, but then the extreme of this is like a lot of women saying, um, you know, it was used in a way that was like, if, I mean, I'm not gonna, we're not gonna link it, but there was a pastor recently who said basically if a wamp, I can't even say this without just, it's so bad, but I mean, it makes our point. If a woman's wearing shorts and gets raped, like he felt like that was her fault. I mean, this is not an extinct thought, but like that level of abuse where it's like, if you're dressed in modestly and something happens to you, like man sin is your responsibility. And I think that level of abuse, spiritual abuse, um, and even the concept of like, yeah, you owe your husband sex and to be a godly, holy wife, you abstain beforehand because he won't want someone who's stained. And then after you owe that to him as like a submissive wife. And so that is like the extreme. Those are some of the extremes of how not everyone, like I said, please don't hear that, but there are some extremes that were taught that way. And I've seen a lot of women online who have said things like, um, that like, I mean, has damaged them in so many ways. And even women who were like still unmarried because of the damage that it's sent to them or, you know, weren't able to have healthy relationships, understandably, um, or even had to separate from Christianity because like Chris is saying, this was taught as like, um, theology and, and not just like, there are obviously aspects of sexuality that are in scripture and our theology, but the whole concept was taught in like conjunction with the gospel and on the same level as salvation in the gospel. And so some women have had to separate from Christianity altogether because it's so inseparable, inseparably linked in their minds. And so that's the only other point that I, I wanted to mention is like, I think this is really important to bring up because, um, yeah, it's something that people are having good conversations about, but like anything, I think it is easy for us to then go to the opposite extreme again, instead of going to scripture. And so just because something, you know, like this was, this was a knee jerk reaction to mistaching. And once again, because this ended up promoting a lot of lies, we don't then need to do the exact same thing. And as believers go to the extreme opposite again in reaction to it, but however, go back to scripture and rebuild those theologies and you know, the concept of identity and what is purity and what is holiness and, um, what is a healthy marriage and all those things. Um, instead of just going to the office at extreme now and saying like, well, we're just going to do the opposite of everything that was taught because it was parts of it were harmful. Does that, right? Am I saying that well, right. But anyway, any other thoughts? Kind of my initial, my initial thought about the conversation. No, I think that's good. I think it is. And I think we'll have further conversations about this as well. Moving forward. For sure. This is a good start. And I agree. I think it is something that many people have had a hard time kind of recovering from, as is often the case in Christianity, that it's, it's not the core faith. That's the problem. It's a, it's a movement within Christianity that creates an issue. So, and I think that's perhaps for sure. And I think it's also, it's just something that can be hard just coming from my personal, uh, experience. It's like, I, I don't, sometimes I don't know how I'm being formed or how my theology is being shaped, um, until afterward. And so for the, for instance, you know, uh, being told, like the promotion of a book or something that's like, this is really, you know, important for, I'm just now pulling, I kiss dating goodbye, or those types of things. That's like, when you're a teenager, you're being taught these things. And some, some, some teenagers, I feel like do a really great job of thinking for themselves. Um, I would probably, it took me a while to like separate what I believe from my parents and from those types of things. And I think that can be hard for people who are, you know, new adults, quote unquote, in our context of like, Hey, they're thinking about things on their own. They're real, they're, especially when we're talking about deconstruction, you know, they're, they're thinking about their faith and what they believe critically. And you can realize like, Oh man, I, a lot of stuff was provided to me that I, I might not have necessarily agreed with or, or I twisted it because I was immature or whatever. Um, and so I think, yeah, as, as you continue, thank you for doing this research, Brandon. I'm, I'm excited to see how that continues to, to illuminate maybe some truth and hopefully help other people who are dealing with the same thing. Yeah, absolutely. That's cool. There's plenty of reasons to deconstruct. We don't want to know people to deconstruct for unnecessary ones. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. All right. Well, thanks guys. I appreciate the time.
