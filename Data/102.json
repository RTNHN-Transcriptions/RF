We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. Guys, today we are jumping into some biblical contradictions. Now before we jump into that, I'm going to throw it over to you guys to kind of start off the meat of what we're talking about. A lot of times I feel like in some of the interviews that we've had and then this concept of contradictions continues to come up. And so if you're a listener of this podcast and you have been for a while, I'm sure you have your own things that you have heard, whether on different podcasts or on debates or just conversations that you've had of like, okay, what are contradictions within the Christian faith? Or, you know, somebody says, well, the Bible says this, but it also says this, how can you really believe this? You're ridiculous for believing this. And so, you know, we, there are tons of websites. I mean, literally, if you, if you Google biblical contradictions, the American atheist comes up first, it's got all sorts of things. And so obviously this is not going to be an exhaustive conversation today, but I think it'll be a good, a good start. And we think it's valuable because, you know, we, we obviously believe that, that the belief in Jesus, believe in Christianity is reasonable and not just something like we've said time and again, where you have to like check your brain at the door and not think critically about things. And so as our, specifically as our culture in America grows away from the Judeo-Christian worldview and a lot of people that we interact with on a daily basis, especially intellectually, we'll have differing views on things. And these ideas of contradictions are probably going to come up as we, you know, share life and do life alongside people who don't believe the same thing. And so we hope that these are, are, are useful conversations. And also if you run into some questions that we just haven't hit yet, please feel free to send us an email or shoot us a text or whatever saying like, Hey, this is a conversation that I had. Here's a contradiction that I think would be beneficial to talk to you. So anyway, that's kind of a long on ramp. But can I throw it over to you, Chris, really quick. And then I know that Bryn kind of has a contradiction that we're going to kind of run out of the gates with, but would you add anything to that for our listeners who are like, okay, this is cool. This is different. Yeah, I think so one, the generally speaking, when you're studying the Bible, when you're reading through the Bible, that kind of stuff, you're, you're just not going to run into much of this for sure. And so one of the things I like to say upfront is when, when you say, okay, we're going to now dive into the most difficult, challenging, whatever aspects. And then you start unpacking this. We ran into this, we've run into this before with others and then they, then, so we intentionally target the most challenging thing. Then we begin to unpack it in detail. Then one of the responses is, well, why do we have to unpack it in such detail? Shouldn't it be easy? Right. And so one, my answer would be, I don't, I mean, no, I don't see why it should be easy. That makes no sense to me. Every relationship I've ever been a part of has aspects of it that are difficult and hard and things that you're looking at. And then second, I would say it's, we are intentionally looking at something that is the most difficult. So out of, you know, 66 books and thousands of pages of material and all the different issues we've talked about, hermeneutics, we're then going to narrow it down to the things that seem some of the most challenging. So when we're diving through or digging through, and it seems like we're even, you know, we're going to be parsing language and, and looking at this stuff, you go like, wow, y'all are working really hard to make this okay. Well, that's, that's because we're picking some of the toughest things and the narrowest things. And then we've got to divide that out. So we're about to be doing some biblical surgery, don't expect it to not be bloody. And so, and there, and, and by the way, I will always say one possibility that, that I'm okay with the fact that some people come to the conclusion, well, that's just a contradiction. And then you've got to decide does that contradiction, is it a faith in there? Yeah. Or is it just, okay, there's a perspective difference, or it's a different word. Exactly. This affects how I'm going to study this type of scripture or this aspect of scripture or whatever. But, so I don't fear there being actual contradictions in the Bible. Some people might really be freaked out by that. Yeah. I don't, I don't think there are actual contradictions in that what the Bible intends to accomplish, it does accomplish. I think there are different perspectives, different people, different ways of understanding something. So if I say, Hey, my wife's going away for the weekend, so I'm going to be a bachelor this weekend. Okay. That I actually don't mean I'm not married this weekend. And you know that, then you know that. And so the word means something different in that context than it would if I'm saying, Hey, I've never been married, I'm a bachelor and you know, set me up on a date. Like those are, I don't mean set me up on a date this weekend. Right. And you, and you know that. So, and part of the problem is though, we, when we study scripture, we see a word and we think that word should mean the exact same thing everywhere we study it or under every condition we study it. And that's just not, that's not accurate. And so we, we're going to dive into some tough ones. In fact, I think one of the ones that, that Brynne's going to bring to us today, I actually think is really, is really a challenging conversation to have. Yeah. And, and we are going to be doing an apologetic with it. So first, we're going to unpack it. Because I've actually never dug into this as much as I would like to. So I'm appreciative for the chance to do it, but it's an apologetic, which means a defense. So I'm going to be starting on the assumption that the character of God is not in conflict with the character of God, that the character of God is not in contradiction with the character of God. So I'm going to be trying to defend that. And I think we all are, but recognizing, so don't go, gosh, how come you're just, all you're doing is defending. Yes. From the beginning, I'm going to start with that. Is there a way to make these questions okay? That you don't have to think something is, is in contradiction about God's character? Because those are the ones that really matter the most. You know, was, was the flood the whole planet or was it just part of the planet? Okay. I mean, I'm, you know, did the fig tree wilt early or did it wilt immediately or did it take 24 hours? I can, and I think we will, another podcast, either we already have, I don't remember what order things are going to land. We either already have touched on those on the, on the podcast, or we will be touching on those types of things. But this, this one is a, or I think the one, I don't actually know for sure, but I think the one that Bren is going to be bringing to us is a, it's a bigger, it's a much bigger picture and it's about the character of God, which makes it more important. Yeah. Hey, Bren, no pressure. This is the biggest one and you better get it right. Yeah. So, which Chris has not dug into before. No, I'm just kidding. Well, yeah. You're bringing us new, this is a new word. All right. Go for it, Bren. Sorry. Well, no, I was just going to add to what Chris was saying, but also saying that yes, we are starting out defending the character of God, but that's because as we've talked about many, many times, we've also done the hard work of being convinced ourselves that God's character is trustworthy. So it's not like we're just starting out saying, Oh yeah, I'm gonna, I'm, I heard an expression this weekend that was saying I'm starting with, I'm with what I know is right. And now I'm going to try to figure out why. And, and so that's like not the perspective that we're taking obviously of like, yeah, even if we are starting out defending the character of God in this, it's because we have been convinced that his character is consistent and faithful. And so it's, it's more from the perspective of, we just don't understand, we may not fully understand how it's faithful in this aspect yet. So that's why we dig into it. I don't know. Yeah. But, um, yeah, but the other thing I want to say before we dig in specifically was that the reason we're tackling this right now is because we have been engaging with people who have deconstructed or people who either in person or, um, by email and text and whatever it is who are wrestling with questions. And so this is just another avenue of that in our mind, even if they're, um, and some of it is yes, people that we have relationships with who have these questions about does the Bible contradict itself? But then a lot of people online who say, and maybe y'all, maybe one of you said this earlier, but, um, a lot of people online who cite reasons that they deconstruct say that it is, um, partially because, well, the Bible contradicts itself and it's not trustworthy. And that's like in a list of things typically. Right. Um, so that's one of the reasons we're tackling it. But yeah, so I wanted to, when we started talking about doing this and like, what's a verse that is a curious one for me personally, and all of us going around, the one that came to mind for me was does God tempt people? Um, is that the one that you were thinking I was talking about, Chris? That is the one. Okay, good. Um, so I was just, I'll read a couple of verses and then you guys can throw in others. If you think of some that relate to this, but the two that I've seen quoted a lot as contradictory are James one 13 and then Genesis 22. And I'll read both of them. James one 13 says, let no one say when he is tempted, I'm being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one. And then Genesis 22. So I'm going to read, because this is the version that is often cited, I'm going to read it in King James and then read it in ESV. So this is 22 in one, one through two says in King James says, and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him, Abraham, and he said, behold, I, here I am. And he said, now take thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee up. I don't read King James often. So that's hard. Very good job. I was like, some of these words. Okay. But then thank you to be a period actress. Yes, for sure. It was that good. Yeah, it was really good. Anyway, ESV. Um, yeah. And then ESV is 22 one through two. After these things, God did test Abraham and said to him, Abraham, and he said, here I am. And he said, take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love and go to the land of Mariah and offer him. There is a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will tell you. Okay. So there are there other verses that talk about God specifically tempting people that come to mind before we unpack it that you guys know of or have thought of. We can go off of these two, but just before we start, um, are those the two that you typically think of as far as now, as far as the idea of God not tempting people, there's several, but when it comes to the idea of God tempting someone, that's the only one that I've, that I've seen that it is saying God tempted someone. Um, there are other places where we see God put situations in people's lives or even send spirits to deceive people, which, which feels very similar. Um, for sure. Yeah. It just doesn't use the word tempt, but it does not use the word tempt clearly. Okay. So, so some examples of that would be, well, we can go into that, but so just on face value, kind of like looking at this, one of the things that I noticed immediately is this is really quoted often, but even like we just demonstrated and we've talked about King James and some interpretation things in the past. So I don't know that we need to deep dive into that, but just the fact that King James was translated a long time ago before there were a lot of documents discovered, um, that are even closer to the original, um, written text than when King James was out. And so that would typically only apply to new Testament though. Oh, you're right. Okay. That's a good, that's a good, I don't, I, now I could be wrong about that, but I don't know that that, I mean, with the exception of the, of the Dead Sea Scrolls. And I don't think this is an issue of, if it's, if there's a textual issue here, I'm not aware of it. There is a translational decision being made about the Hebrew word there. But, but I don't know that that's interesting then. I don't think the Dead Sea, let me look up and see. But I don't think the Dead Sea Scrolls had anything different there. Okay. No, that's, that's good then. Um, but I think that's, it's worth noting just that ESV and KJV translated differently because when it comes to context, the word tempt and the word test mean very different things. And, and in my mind, and maybe Chris and Colson, you might disagree, but in my mind, God tempting someone indicates that he is presenting the opportunity of, or even the appeal of sin to them and giving them kind of like prompting them, not pushing them to sin, but kind of prompting it. And test would mean that he is giving them the opportunity to resist sin. Um, in my mind, is there a definition? I feel like they're the same. I think there's a great conversation. I actually was wondering if this is where we wanted to start even was even in the English, what are the differences between the word tempt, test and temptation, test and trial. Um, and how do we know which one we're dealing with? And I have not unpacked this with anybody. So I want to have this together. Like I think that's an interesting question. Do what is the difference here? What are your thoughts? As far as we could look them up online and see like the definition. I'm also just thinking, so yeah, yeah. Cause I was like first going to the context of what was happening in Genesis 22, but, but I think that's actually a better place to start as like, what do we mean? Like what is the difference as far as terms? Let's start. Yeah, let's start there. Let's start with terms and definition and then go to context. Maybe it sounds good to me. Um, so just, this is a great exercise in, um, just studying scripture. Yeah. So even going to Merriam Webster, tempt means to entice to do wrong by promise of pleasure or gain to cause to be strongly inclined to induce to do something. Um, synonyms, allure, bait, decoy, entice, seduce, solicit, and then test a procedure reaction used to identify or characterize a substance. Um, a critical examination. That one doesn't apply. Um, to put to the test or prove to require to undergo a test to evaluate to test as a means of analysis. Yeah. Okay. I'm looking for synonyms. Trial is a synonym. Interesting. Experiment. Yeah. Okay. And then did you also want trial or you want just those two, Chris? I think it'd be good to get trial. What do you notice of those one trial? Well, when I was doing it in my head, when I was trying to delineate, like what would I count as, as someone tempting me versus someone testing me versus someone trying me. And here's my intuition is that a trial is just anything that's hard. Yeah. Just being squeezed, challenged. Um, anything that would be difficult would be trying. So that I think tempting a temptation is a type of trial and a test is a type of trial. That's kind of where my brain went quickly. So trial is kind of the umbrella. The umbrella and then a temptation. So tempting somebody makes it seem to me. Yeah. Are you hearing and I'm hearing a slight echo. I don't think I am. No, no, I'm not. Okay. Good. Okay. Sorry. No problem. So the temptation to me, what would delineate a temptation from a test? So I think if I sit down and take a math test, a test is evaluating my current stance, my current knowledge, my current understanding, my current physical abilities, that kind of thing like, like, okay, we're going to, we're going to max bench press or, or we're going to take a test at the end of the biology chapter, or it has to be challenging, but, but it's not the effort isn't to get me to fail. The effort is not to deceive me into failing. It is just a test. It has to be honest. Like that's one of the things that made a test different for me to tempt me is to try to make me do something wrong. You, you now have a goal. The goal of a test, the motive behind, yeah, the goal of the test is to evaluate my current stance. The goal of a temptation is to get me to do something. And it almost always, if not always, by the way, I'm going to work on this, but it certainly implies that something is being promised, but I'm being deceived. Like this is going to bring you satisfaction. This is going to bring you happiness. This is going to bring you pleasure. This is going to bring you, and it's not going to call like there, there's something dishonest about a temptation to me. It's like the serpent with Eve is obviously the original kind of temptation. You won't die. You'll actually be like God. Okay. There's, there's some truth in that, but it's also at the same time, a deception, an over promise. You're, you're good. These things are going to happen. These things won't happen. And so with a temptation, can you have a temptation that isn't somehow promising something or, or like there's not some kind of perceived and at least implied dishonest reward on the other end of it? I don't know. But there is a big difference. Even culturally when we, yeah, go ahead. No, no, that's okay. I'm good. Well, even culturally, like when we use the word tempt, like I don't think it's ever like, Oh yeah, they were tempting me to do something positive or that I should have done. Yeah. Right. You know, like it's never, it's never, um, used in the same way as, um, test. I feel like can, you know, be different, have different motives, but it's tempt solely seems to be with a negative intent or deception like you're saying. And even if you take it, tempting me to go be kind to my neighbor, you know, right. And then the other side of things is like, I think you can also take it out of the, um, and I, I'm not trying to say out of the Christian conversation, but I feel like if you're talking about, if you're talking about this concept with somebody who doesn't share the same beliefs, I think about people who are tempted to vengeance. And it's a common thing of like, you know, even in non-Christian circles of like, yeah, I know revenge seems sweet, but it's not. And so it's like, you, you think, Oh, this is really going to feel this. So, so even if you're not thinking about the consequences of sin or something like that, as a, as a non-believer, my thought would be when you're having these arguments of like, Hey, you're being, you are being tempted to do something. It is, yeah, it's promising something that it's not actually going to deliver people talking about, you know, Oh man, well, I, you know, I, I really wanted to hit him in the face, but I actually, after I did that, I didn't feel any better. You know? So it's like, yeah, the enticement, or even if I did, it was not long-term. It wasn't, it wasn't yeah. It doesn't, wasn't lasting. So it was like, I don't know if that's relevant, but I do think like what just to, yeah, just to include, it's relevant. Cause I think it's as, as a term, I do agree that it's like enticing you to do something that is not, it's like, it's not going to follow through or it's not going to last. The result won't last. Yeah. I agree with you. I also, I'm curious what you guys think, but I also don't feel like Tim tempt is a word that people who are not religious use often. Like people, I feel like they do when they, when you talk about food, Oh, you're so right. I feel like food is tempting to people. Like that word things to be tempted by cold. Oh, don't tempt me with that. Right. You know, with those peanut butter cups or whatever, you know, that's interesting in the therapeutic world, people use it usually talking about like affairs. Okay. Like I was tempted to do something. Um, and, and that was like, I was tempted to engage in this. I was in tempted. I was tempted to do this and they don't, they don't necessarily, they're not assigning it to a person. It's not so much that I hear people say, you know, this temptress was, you know, it's not assigned to a person so much. Um, but it is a, I was, it's a, it's a passive. Like I was tempted. Yeah. And, and, and it's interesting because I think there is a sense in which maybe a temptation, maybe both fall under the heading of tests, but maybe you can make the air. I think we use the word test as if a temptation can be a test because it is, it is evaluating me in the moment. So if I, if I'm saying, all right, this week I'm losing weight, I'm taking in this many calories, I'm burning this many calories. And then the next that day someone comes in and they're like, Hey, you know, someone else who's in a contest with me is like, Hey, I got a dozen donuts, Chris, if you want a donut. And I resist the temptation, I might refer to that as passing a test because a temptation can also be a test in that it does evaluate my current stance or I failed that test. Um, but is it, is it a temptation? So it's a temptation for me if someone shows up with donuts, but they're not trying to tempt me. They just are tempting me. Um, but the temptation is to do something that I know I shouldn't do. And I, I put the word sin, but I don't know that has to be a sin. It's just, it's just the desire to do something that shouldn't do. Incidentally, I just checked. And as I understand that the Dead Sea Scrolls include portions of Genesis 22, but not verse one. Oh, interesting. And so that word there nasa in a S a H, if you transliterate it into English, which you know, is different. Um, it is a primary route. It's, it is a route, which means, uh, in Hebrew, and remember this is Hebrew to test or to try. Um, if you accomplish it, you're considered proven. It is proved. However, three times in the Bible, it is translated. It's typically translated test like 20 something times. It's translated test three times as translated, tempted. Um, and so again, you run into the, to the issue of it can mean tempted, but it typically means tested. What I don't know is in Hebrew thinking exactly what the difference is between those, those two things. Um, so it, it's a, the question, again, it comes down, I think it does come down to the question of what is God intending to do here? Is he trying to tempt Genesis or I mean, attempt Abraham, or is he giving him a test? Is he putting him into a test? Um, and I think part of what helps us understand is what are the consequences of, of it? Like it is a, is it, and, and what are the conversations that have happened afterwards? And I think there's a good argument to make that based on the conversation that God has with Abraham afterwards, it is a, okay, we now both know where you stand, which makes it sound like, even if you're going to argue that it's somehow that he is tempting him, but I don't, I don't see how you're tempting someone to do something they don't want to do. So the main thing about temptation is it's like, I don't get tempted to go work out. I don't get tempted, tempted too fast. I don't get tempted to clean the dishes. Like, and that's clearly what this is. I mean, I don't see how this one can be defined as a temptation in that this isn't, you know, a God sent a sociopath. Yeah, exactly. Abraham just loves killing people. Can't wait to kill. And we don't have any evidence of that. Son, he waited a hundred years for it. So childhood does stuff to you. And, and by the way, he's like, I don't know if you've ever done it, but I'm trying to, okay, I gotta look it up because make sure I don't say the wrong number here. But I think he's like 19. Isaac is man. Isaac is not a little kid here. He's a strapping man against it. And yes, an ancient decrepit, decrepit older man. Sorry. How old is Isaac here? This one says 12. But I don't know. Yep. Faster than a hundred and I don't know if he was sickly, maybe not. I'm just kidding. He was just a wimp. Yeah. Anyway. Um, but back to the, yeah, go ahead. Colson. No, I mean, I, yeah. Cause I'm like, what, what would, I don't know. Like, I don't know what the, what the atheist, like, what is the, what is the devil's advocates? By the way, here's another one that says he was 26. So 18 to 20 years old. Here's another one. So, so somewhere hit someone else. Here's another arabic al teaching that he was 37. So he's not, no one is trying to argue that he was a little kid. The youngest I found is 12. But when you subtract the years from his marriage, based on again, we've talked about deep old Testament stuff, deep Genesis, math, the math and that dig years are gotta be careful with. Um, but, uh, that it was in fact, was a funny ginger ginger was studying something the other day. And she was like, she said something to me. She goes, did you know that we don't know such and such? Like, yeah, I did know. We didn't know that it was like the number of Israelites who came out of Israel, that, that it's kind of like Daniel with Nebuchadnezzar that the, or you know, with Nebuchadnezzar, like he was driven mad for seven periods of time. Like, well, how long was the period of time? Cause that matters if it was seven seconds, that's very different from seven months or seven years. And we just don't know. Well, it was, it was like, so they came out in six troops and no one knows how many is in a troop. So you got to love that that it was very important that it was six troops, but no one, like we, we really have no idea some of these things anyway. This is like that. We don't know exactly. But he was again, not some kid being traumatized by being dragged up on a mountain strap down and or whatever. So anyway, that's a good thing to know. I, I don't know. So I actually don't think this is the best case to make that God tempted, that God ever tempted anybody. Okay. I think there's a better, there are better cases to be perfectly honest. So once again, I think I would make a better atheist than a lot of the atheists. So I mean, do you, like in, in my mind, I think I would like to walk down that road. Do you want to, do you want to go there now or do you want to wrap up? Can you actually say why then you don't, is it why you don't think this is a temptation? I don't think about any definite, any reasonable definition. I don't see how this is a temptation. Yeah. God is the only thing you could argue is that God is tempting Abraham to obey him or tempting. Maybe you would say it this way. He's tempting him not to obey him. He's tempting him to not kill. I guess that's the temptation would be God says, kill your son. And Abraham is supposed to say, no, no, I'm not going to, he's tempting him to disobey. So I guess, I guess it works from that perspective. That is something he would want. So now that I say that, I guess it can reverse itself too either way. So I'm tempting him to not, I'm tempting him to disobey me and Abraham doesn't disobey him. But even in the passage, it makes it clear that Abraham is trusting that even if he disobeys him, God will either bring in a different sacrifice or as we learn in Hebrews, or will resurrect his son from the dead because he's already told him. Yeah. And so, and it turns out he's exactly right. God is going to provide a different sacrifice. He's not going to have him kill him. So it's, he's going through the process of obeying God to do something that seems unthinkable, knowing God has revealed himself clearly that this is unthinkable. And so God's must have something else that he's planning on doing here. And Abraham knows that and this isn't so far. I mean, if we're going to take this as literal, then we have to take the fact that this isn't some guy who just is having thoughts and visions, like a modern day schizophrenic might, that he needs to kill his children. This is someone who is literally engaged with God in a physical presence. So anyway, well, and like you said, I think the, the passage after that, that follows clearly by context indicates that it was God testing. Yeah. By our, by how exactly, by how we just defined it exactly. Yeah. Yeah. To verify that he, he doesn't, you know, love his son more than God. Right. So yeah, that would mean a test of character. Yeah. So I, I think the King James is a good, makes a better. Oh, I think there's a couple that make better case for that. So the King James, I think that's just a translational, a bad translational decision. And that may be because the word tempt meant something different in the 1500s than it does now. We run into that all the time is that it may have been a good translation then, and it's a bad translation now. And so that's, it's, you know, when we think about how quickly language can change when we're, you know, here we are in the holiday season. And, and when you talk about putting on gay apparel, we're seeing about putting on gay apparel. Well, when that song was written, however many years ago it was written, that didn't mean the same thing as now. And so it may be that in the 1500s, tempt was better understood as a test or something. I don't know for sure. But I think, I think we can recognize, yes, God created the conditions to prove something, to evaluate for Abraham and I guess to some degree for God, but I'll think, obviously God knew this, to evaluate Abraham's current stance. Are you willing to obey me? Are you the right person for me to fulfill my promise to Eve through? Is this how this is going to work? I want you to see that you love me more than you love my own, my provision to you. And you can imagine why. And by the way, this also is a little bit of a punishment. Putting Abraham in this situation is a discipline for the fact that Abraham and his wife had put, had really abused Hagar and her son. And so, you know, there's definitely a justice being done here where God is saying, your firstborn son of Hagar, you have abandoned and I am now putting you in a position to at least believe you're going to have to abandon the son I gave you too. And that's a, there's no doubt this is meant to create, this is a teachable moment that's meant to create a hard conversation between God and Abraham on purpose. I don't think that's the case, a challenge. I think there's a couple more challenging ones to have to delineate because in my opinion, the Genesis 22 one, however you define it is a test. And so it makes more sense to translate that word, nasa, which typically means test. It can mean tempt, at least sometimes some people think it means tempt. What I was looking up and what I'll continue to look up here in a second is, is there a better Hebrew or a different Hebrew word for tempt? And I just, I'm not enough of a Hebrew scholar to know off top of my head, so I've got to look it up. But anyway, so I think that's a, that's one issue that I want to see. And then, because I think there is, I just, again, I'm not the expert, but then we can look at a couple other passages that I've, if I were making this case, for example, I would look at 1 Kings, chapter 22. And if one of y'all wants to turn to 1 Kings, chapter 22, and kind of get the context for it, tell us the context about it, and then unpack, especially starting down in verse 20 and following. But anyway, y'all look at that, y'all look at that while I try to see if I can find this thing about the other word. Yeah, that, get the context there, unpack that a little bit, and then go from there. Okay, so looking at the context of 1 Kings 22 that you were talking about. So for those of you who are listening, who don't have your Bibles open, one, it'd be good for you to just pause it and read through it, because I hadn't really taken time to do this. But it recounts the story of the King of Israel and the King of Judah. So, and their consulting prophets for going against the Syrians, is that right? I think that's right. I think it's the Syrians, but whoever it is. If they're going to succeed in going up to defeat them. Yes. And so there's a group of prophets that are saying, you will succeed. And then there's one prophet named, is it Micaiah? Micaiah. Micaiah, who says, uh, you don't, or like, basically here, I can read it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, um, because, which it's funny because the, the King of Israel is like, I don't like him. He always, he always brings me bad news, which I thought was really funny. Yes. Um, I need, find me a prophet who lies to me. Exactly. I don't care if it's true or not. I just want good news. Yeah. But that's another one of those, like the people in the Bible are real people. Yeah. Yep. So, but, but the, the contradiction kind of comes in, um, you know, from 19 on and Micaiah said, therefore hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left. And the Lord said, who will entice Ahab? That's the, the King of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead. And one said one thing and another said another, then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord saying, I will entice him. And the Lord said to him, by what means? And he said, I will go out and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, you are to entice him and you shall succeed. Go out and do so. Okay. So, and then it comes to pass that, you know, they, they put Micaiah, I mean, they throw him in prison or whatever, because they don't like his news. Yep. They go up to battle and lo and behold, his prophets were not right. Or that the prophets, like the prophets that they had assembled beforehand saying, you'll succeed are not right. He actually even disguises himself and in the battle. And it says, it's funny, it's like in verse 34, but a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the King of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. So it's like, he was disguised. He wasn't even dressed as a King. Right. And this guy draws his bow at random. This King seeking arrow. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So it's like, and it, and it comes to pass that what Micaiah said was actually correct. Yeah. I kind of went about that in a roundabout way. No, no, that it's, it's not an, yeah, it's not an easy passage for at a thousand different ways. It's not an easy passage. Obviously the part we're emphasizing right now is, is like the fact that it's not an easy passage from a perspective of God says to him, you are to entice him and you shall succeed. Go and do it. And that sounds like God is sending a spirit to tempt someone to believe a lie and do something foolish. Yeah. If not evil, at least foolish. So, so there we go. Now that now, how do you one, so how do, how do you guys like, what are some things when I look at this, there's a few things that stand out to me kind of immediately. And I think one is too easy an answer, but it's, it's a tempting one, which is, you know, God isn't the one doing it. Okay. So it's, it's not God doing the tempting. Now, again, I think if I were on the other side of this argument, I'd be like, which I agree with by the way, I'm not right. But you just said that. You did just say that, okay, this is cheap. It is cheap. It is also true, but it's, it is, it does feel like a cop out. Because I think my cop out answer is like, we're talking about how if, if God is the definer of, of everything, if he is the ultimate authority, what, why can't he say it? Cause it's almost like he's giving, it's like, is he saying, Oh, you will succeed? Or is she just saying, of course you will succeed. I know the heart of they have. And so he's going to be deceived. Yeah. So is God doing the tempting? Is he just allowing this thing to come to pass? Cause you can, I, but again, I think that's part partially maybe a little bit of a cop out too. It can be all these are real factors. What, what, where the whole conversation is based on the fact that in the book of James, we have this passage that says God does not tend to anyone to evil, by the way, it does say that. So that's, that's important. It does. He does. He tempt me to, would he maybe tempt me to eat a donut? Well, I don't, I don't think so. But if he did, that would not defy James chapter one, because that's not evil for me to eat. That makes sense. So I think that's important to keep in mind. James does clarify God doesn't tempt anyone to evil. So that, that matters. And I don't know that this is evil, that this, this passage is, is not necessarily like that, but I think it's intriguing that it, but it is like deception. There is a sense in which there is a deceptive thing going on. Now I'm a little difficult on the passage in that it feels to me like Micaiah is actually coming clean about all of this to the very, to, to some of the very people who don't want to hear it. Yeah. So I don't know, like I don't know how that plays into this. Like he's, and even more importantly, maybe for the understanding of this passage is that this is a vision, not an event. Micaiah is not saying, God did this and I saw it. He's saying, God gave me a vision of God. I saw the Lord sitting on the throne and the host, like there's a vision. And so it's very dangerous to take any vision as some kind of literal theological, you know, goings on here. So there's, there's a lot here to, to make this suspicious for sure. And I, I think the truth of the matter is that it is God saying to this spirit in this, the word entice we looked at in the Hebrew. And again, entice is a totally appropriate word, but so is persuade. And so, you know, it is, okay, you're going to go to him. You're one way or another. And ironically, maybe by telling him the truth, you're going to persuade him to do the false thing is really kind of how this plays out. And so, but the spirit is the one who's apparently persuading Ahab to do the right, to do the foolish thing, even though the prophet is telling him to do the wise thing. And so it's such a funny little game that's being played here where God is saying like, yeah, you, when you talk to him, when you fool him, he'll be fooled. Like he's, he's an idiot. It actually, the Hebrew probably literally means to be made simple. Yes. So you're, you're going to make him, he's, he's going to be made simple through this process. He is going to believe what he wants to believe. So, um, I don't, I don't see this as deeply problematic. Yes. Um, I don't think this is, I think there's a lot of ways to escape, so to speak, the idea that this is actually God tempting someone to do evil. It is at best a vision of someone seeing God send or encourage or confirm a spirit that wants to deceive Ahab to do it. And God is saying, go for it because it's, it's, it's going to work. Yes. Um, and so I agree that it's a tough passage in that sense, but it's also, there are so many ways to say, and by the way, what he's tempting Ahab to do is not sin. It's just foolish. It gets him killed, but it's not sin. It's what Ahab is going to do and wants to do anyway. Um, and it is the way that God has decided to bring Ahab down. Yeah. Um, so anyway, I, I, I get that someone reading that would be like, this seems squirrely. I agree. I don't think it's a clear contradiction of the idea that Jesus, that God does not tempt people to evil. Yeah. What do y'all think? Is that, is it just, I mean, is it, are the waters just muddy enough or is it, is there something to that that we think, you know, we need, we need to somehow make God put God, behold, God has put a lying spirit in the mouth of your prophets and he's, and then God sends a prophet to warn them that God has, there is a lying spirit in the mouth of your prophets and God has sent me to warn you that he has allowed this spirit to come lie to you. That God has put the spirit there and, and then he's sending me to warn you. And because I'm a prophet of God too, and I'm the one trustworthy prophet, a student of Elijah of all things. And, uh, and the Lord has declared disaster for you. And so they slap him. Yeah. And I mean, it definitely seems treating. It just seems like Ahab from the beginning already has the, the, the cards are set against Micaiah anyway. Yeah. And, and Micaiah is doing the right, he's trying to do the right thing. He's trying to help Ahab make a wise decision and it gets him in trouble. Um, so it feels to me like God is giving Ahab plenty of ways out of this, even though he also sent a spirit. Um, kind of like you talked about off air, how it's kind of like God, when, when God, when Satan comes to God and God mentions Job and Satan says, Oh yeah, he's, this is the, these are the limits that if you test Job like this, he will fail. And God essentially says, okay, testing. And there's a little bit of this here. A spirit comes to God and says like, Oh, if I test Ahab, he will fail. And God's like, yeah, you're right. He will. So go, go for it. Yeah. Um, so I feel like that the only difference between these two is that the spirit is, is a dishonest spirit versus Satan who was a dishonest spirit, but doesn't say I'm going to go lie to him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. And then we, then we also have God saying you will succeed versus with Joe. We just don't, he doesn't say, Oh no, he won't, he won't write exactly. And it's interesting though. Um, okay. So that's one that people wrestle with. Do people wrestle with, I know that you have a list. Do people wrestle with, uh, the fact that like the story of Moses and Pharaoh, like when like God makes him, like, it's like once he got hardens his heart when God hardens his heart. Well, that's obviously a hard one for all of us. Right. What's weird about that one is the way it isn't God tempting, right? Tempting him is it is like God forcing it, forcing the case. Yeah. It's like, no, you're, you are going to, um, and, and some of the passages, Pharaoh is hardening his own heart. And sometimes it's God hardening Pharaoh's heart. And part of that again is the language. Yeah. In the Hebrew mind, is that saying the same thing that if you harden your heart, that must mean God hardened it or vice versa. If he got hardened it, that must mean you did. Um, cause I've always taken it as like, Hey, he, he reached like he had hardened his heart enough to where it's like, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to carry this out. Well, we do see that. And we talked about that, even back in Samuels with the sons of Eli, that there came a point at which God said, okay, I've, I've now passed judgment and you're still alive. You're still doing evil things, but I've passed judgment and it's done. So there's no coming back from that. Now you can't now come to me and say, Oh, we're so sorry. We repent. We confess. We whatever. And at least what God declares in that is that he says, I've, I've already decided there is no, I'm not giving you the opportunity to repent anymore. I've already judged you it's done. And, and so you no longer have the option of repentance. And then, and I feel like in those moments, it's also like God knows that you won't. Yeah. And in addition to that, that's right. Unlike us, if someone was molesting my children and I caught them and I was going to, you know, finish them and they said, I'm sorry. I might say, I'm, I'm, I'm super glad you're sorry. And you're still not going to get the opportunity to do it again. I mean, I, I could do that. And the difference between me and God is I would be going, I don't believe you. And God would be saying, I know for sure you won't, if you have any freedom at all. Yeah. So I know that's kind of, I kind of got us off track. No, no, I think at least I think these all apply. I think these are great examples. When you look at, I think, yeah, I thought of that also Colson, I think that's good. No, I had thought of the same thing about Pharaoh. So that's good. But Chris, you have another, you have more to your list though. Yeah. And so how about if we jump over into the New Testament, into second Thessalonians, Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians. So I apologize if I'm, you know, creating more challenges for anybody out there. But if nothing else, hopefully this will help you see that we're not afraid of these tough passages. Well, and I was thinking about this earlier. It's, I think it's good to bring up even examples that might not be common because I think what happens is sometimes these list of contradictions are the most common passages. So like everybody typically knows about Abraham, you know? And so, but I think it's helpful to dig into the ones that less people have read, unless you've read the whole Bible, because then if you go down the road of biblical contradictions, then you're not surprised by these others that you haven't heard of, you know, or like alleged biblical contradictions. But second Thessalonians, what chapter? Second Thessalonians chapter two, looking in verse 11. Do you want to read it, Bryn? Oh, right. I had forgotten about this verse. Do you want me to read it? Yeah, go for it. Start just 11 or I guess 11 and 12. Pick whatever you want. Okay. A lot of times the contradictions are pulled out of context anyway, so it's exactly right. I think that's, that's obviously a good point to make. It's like, doesn't really matter. We're gonna, because we'll, we'll fill out the context. But anyway, go ahead. I'm just gonna read a third of this verse. There you go. There you go. I will read the whole sentence verses 11 and 12. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. Okay. Dang. Mm-hmm. I would, so if I were, you know, pushing, this is, this would be the main one probably for me. I do think it's a contextual issue. Like I'll give you another couple that we won't go into, like we have. This is homework for you, listener. That's right. Deuteronomy chapter four, in verse 34, you have, you know, God, the language there, I think it's a, I think part of this is a language issue, but God's sending great deeds of terror to, in order to accomplish something. And then in Judges nine, it's one of the times when you have God sending a spirit that is, because the Hebrew, the word evil can mean all kinds of things. It can mean evil as in just bad or uncomfortable or whatever. It doesn't necessarily mean evil as in morally evil. And in Judges nine, kind of like we did in first Samuel, you get the God sending an evil spirit to somebody to deceive them. It's very similar to the first King's one. Interesting. But again, it is a, because I think part of this is because we have this bad understanding of, and this is another example of this, this bad understanding of heaven as being divided, you know, God, the angels, the spiritual beings being either angels who are all on board with God or demons who are all in rebellion against God. And the truth is, I think the spiritual realm is more similar to us than we realize in that there are great powerful beings that God has shared power with, just like He did with us, that we're to have dominion over the earth and manage it well and that kind of stuff go and, and, and, you know, be fruitful. But I think, I think there are spiritual beings that are, that work for God that may or may not be, they're spiritual beings in the same way we are physical beings, though we are both. These spiritual beings, some are clearly in rebellion against God. Some are a hundred percent clearly with God and others are sketchy in the way that they live this kind of stuff out or, or just have it experienced. It's so different from us. And so what is it like when, when like that passage, when you have a spirit who is deceptive in nature and comes to God and says, you know what, I'm going to go speak to these prophets and I'm going to, I'm going to put, put deceptive words in their mouth. And God's like, sure. I mean, yes, God could restrain that spirit, but God could restrain me every time I sin too. I mean, if I came to God, it's like, Hey God, I'm going to go, you know, look at this inappropriate thing online. God could say like, no. And in a sense, every single time I sinned that happens, God could restrain me. And then at some point he, he unrestrains me. Affirmation that gets. Yeah, absolutely. And that one is the verbal affirmation for sure. Verbal affirmation of like, yeah, go do this. That's like, what? Yeah. And so whether that's with Job or with judges, the judges nine passage or the one we read in first Kings 22, et cetera, in this one we're dealing with, I think something very similar. So the note that I wrote myself, if you go back to two seven, um, for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. So there's, there's this lawless, this, this, the work of the lawless one, which is often in Christian terms called the antichrist, um, this lawless one, God has restrained these because of the Holy Spirit, because of something God has put in place. And many people think this is the Holy Spirit here. There's only so much the spirit and, and by the way, the, the spirit of lawlessness is, is what's being described in here. There's only so far that that spirit can go. Um, because only so many houses he can go into only so many situations he can go into, so to speak, there's restrictions on him. And when God releases that spirit, when he, when he stops restraining that spirit, what's going to happen is that's going to just sweep across. And so the spirit, like the snake in the garden will make sure that nothing could convince these people. So God is going to release a spirit that right now he restrains and the sending of that spirit, the sending out of the spirit that has been restrained in verse seven and verse 11 is not longer being restrained. And it is, it is instead being sent out. It will now delude these people. These are people like we talked about with the sons of Eli who have already received, they've already been judged. Yeah. They're just still alive and they have not yet received a judgment. And so in order for them to continue that they've already received that judgment, God's judgment is already enacted. He doesn't want their free will overwhelmed. Okay. So let me unpack that just for a second. This is something I've wrestled with. This is one of my big questions was why doesn't God just make it absolutely abundantly clear to all of us? Like why don't he show up? Right? I mean, if God just showed up in the sky and was like, okay, here I am, you're supposed to believe in me, I can wrap my brain. I think it's a fair question. And I don't know the answer because it's a why question about God and his motives are beyond me. But I can, I can estimate there's one thing I can imagine and that is anything I would call free will is gone at that moment. Anything that I would think of as free will, it's kind of like, I mean, I would, I would be totally overwhelmed if God's appearance and God's presence and God's revealing himself so fully like that, then my freedom would be gone. So I am now just stuck doing what it is that God wants. Does that make sense? Yeah. Does it make sense, Bryn, to you? It reminds me of the verse. Yeah. Well, it reminds me of the verse. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with your whole heart. And it's like, it eliminates the, like the desire to seek to know God at that point. Yeah, I think, I think there you go. That's a good way of understanding it too, is like, it would be that I would have no freedom to reject him under those conditions. If he's there in all of his power and glory, I have no freedom at that point to reject him. And, and for whatever reason, we've all understood that God wants us to have the freedom to reject him, at least at this point, if that makes sense. So I think here's what's being described. God has restrained this deceit, this deception, up until now. Now, God is going to reveal himself in this great power. Like this is the tribulation. There's going to be signs and wonders and monsters and demons and all this type of stuff and God's presence. And here's what I think is the case. I think those would overwhelm people's freedom. Like their free will would be gone the minute they begin to experience all of that. So I think God here is saying, when, when that happens, when I'm about to make it absolutely abundantly clear to everybody that I am real, it's kind of like the Rowan Atkinson, the devil video. I think we've watched that before where he's, you know, it's there, all the people are standing there in front of the devil. He's Rowan Atkinson playing the devil and he's calling out different groups of people. He's calling role like people who are these people. And he starts by saying, well, first the atheists. Yes. The you must be feeling like a right bunch of nitwits right now. Right. Like cause you're in hell. So apparently you were wrong. And so, but that, that question is kind of like this. Like at this point, if you're still a nonbeliever, I mean, you must be some kind of nitwit. Like God is literally physically showing himself. Yeah. I think God sends this spirit who he's been restraining. He sends him this, him or her, the spirit, whatever that God's judgment is already enacted and he doesn't want the loss of these people's free will to change their mind. Interesting. And so I think it's, I think that's what he is saying now, that it is therefore God sends us therefore, because if they have already chosen, therefore God sends them a strong delusion. So they may believe what is false in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth and had pleasure in their unrighteousness. Now, I also will tell you, this is what I consider to be maybe the greatest of these challenging passages. Is this right here? In Second Thessalonians. Second Thessalonians. It's the one, it's the one that I am least comfortable with. I think I have an answer to it that makes sense. And I think that works. I don't feel like I'm having to twist the passage. I think, cause I went back and read this passage over and over and over again about the man of lawlessness. And one, it's a passage that's, it is definitely tough for us because it's like, man, it is this whole concept of the antichrist and what it means and how we're going to do that. Like I want all this being just so tough, but it's clear that what God is saying here is I have restrained certain powers, certain spirits, and one of them is a spirit of delusion. If this spirit was in the world right now today, maybe no one would believe. And so instead, here's what we've got is we've got this, the spirit that God then sends out. And these ones who have already made their decision is that he does not want them to change their decision without freedom. Which, which is interesting. We can, you know, we could spend a lot of time unpacking. What does that mean about the character of God? Yep. Yeah. Oh yeah. He has already passed this judgment and he knows this is the right answer. And he's so much wants human beings to have freedom to have free will is that he's not, he's not willing to overwhelm their free will, even for them to become believers. Right. Which again, you're like, this is hard. Yeah. I would, I wish you would. Right. Yeah. I was going to say, like, I'm okay with him overwhelming my free will in order to, you know, help me believe. Right. But apparently he isn't. And I think this passage shows that now that's my opinion. That's my interpretation. There are others. But anyway, well, but thank you for taking time to unpack that. I think this is good for all of us. Because I think, you know, we can, no matter if you, you know, you were, you came no matter, no matter where you came to faith in your life, you know, I think there's a lot of us who are probably listening to the podcast who came to faith as little kids. And so sometimes it can be these things while it's like, we haven't thought about them. I think it is important because if you're going to have these intellectual conversations, I mean, who is it that was it? Was it Dan who was saying like, he's just been so humbled by having conversations with people who don't believe the same thing because they are so well researched. Yeah. And he was just like, man, it's, it's, I've had to eat piece after piece of humble pie. And like, man, you know, so if you're going to have these conversations, if this is something, I mean, clearly you're interested in because you're listening to this podcast, I think these are, you know, these are worth wrestling with. And it's good to know. I think I hope you're encouraged. Yeah, absolutely. That other people are wrestling with it too. You know, it's like, so if you find yourself sitting there and you're like, man, this is actually hard. Yeah, it is. And you're in good company. No, I totally agree. The other thing I was going to say is it also, it's been interesting recently thinking about just digging deeper into theology. We talked about this. I talked about this with some students over, we had our worldview weekend this past weekend. And one of the things that I think is cool about these conversations is, you know, some people have the perception that theology is just for some people or, you know, theology is just for the professional Christians or whatever it is. And it's like, no theology is like what you believe about God, which applies to all of us. We all have a theology, whether or not we admit it. But all that to say, I think the cool thing about digging into this stuff is that when we miss digging into really hard things in scripture about life, we often miss like the deep parts of theology, which gives us like a beautiful, more full picture of God. And so I think it's cool because sometimes we, it is important to dig into things that cause doubt or whatever, but it also allows us to like have those conversations about the character of God and different things that end up just really giving us a bigger, more beautiful picture than the like narrow view of God that we've often had. I agree. And I would say, I think, you know, to kind of wrap up a little bit of this conversation, I would say that we can trust that what James says is that God doesn't tempt anyone towards evil to evil. Now that whole passage, James one is all about temptation and trials and tests. And a lot of times in the Greek, it's the same word or same root words. And so it can be a challenging to people, but to understand, I think what James, he literally in the same passage will say, God does test us and try us. He just does not tempt us. And in this, in that same section, and yet they're similar words. And so it's clear he's delineating, he's trying to teach this delineation to us in this passage. Yes, you face counted all joy when you face trials of various types, counted all joy when you face, when you face tests and you pass the tests and that our own, our own desires lead us into these temptations. But it's not God who's leading us to tempt. So it's like God gives us a trial, but it's our own failing that causes us to be tempted to fail even that trial. It isn't God, when He gives us the trial, isn't the temptation, the desire to avoid or fail or to whatever in the trial, that is the temptation to find an easier route. That's the temptation. Instead, we should count it all joy when we do face those type of trials. So I think that's exactly the purpose of James chapter one. If you go through the whole passage from one, one all the way down through 13 or 14, that you see those words used over and over again. And there's really two different words used. And, and it's meant to help us understand when you face something that's really, really hard, don't, don't blame God for the fact that you're tempted, blame yourself for the fact that you're tempted, you can blame God for the trial. You can even blame God for the test, but don't, don't blame God that you're actually tempted to fail at the test. That's our own limitations. And I think that's what's been told. God doesn't tempt us to evil. And I think, I think that is a safe thing. And, and by the way, we know from, from Paul's letter to the Corinthians that when we do face a temptation, an actual real life temptation, God also always provides a way to avoid that temptation. We don't always follow it for sure. But yeah, I think that's good. That's why Jesus tells us we should pray that God would lead us away from the evil one. So there's that little parentheses clause there, or that little comma clause, like so I'd lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. And so as God guides us through life, we're asking God, please don't put me in positions that tempt me. But knowing He's going to put us in positions that test us and we may be tempted to fail the test, if that makes sense. So anyway, I think it's, I think it's a great conversation. I think it's, and I love that we get to unpack it. And when people go, man, I don't, these seem contradictory. Don't, we love that. So if you've got those, throw them at us and we'll, we'll unpack and look at them honestly. And you'll hear in our voice, you'll hear us say, and we can totally sympathize with the fact that this is hard and it's challenging to us. And that there's passages I don't like, and I don't like that I have to work so hard to see how they fit in with the whole picture. But we still do. Yeah. There you go. That's great. Well, Bryn, thank you so much for bringing that up. And then Chris, again, thank you for engaging with us in that conversation to really bring some light to it. No, I love it. Great. Yeah, that's great. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review. It'll help other people find us.
