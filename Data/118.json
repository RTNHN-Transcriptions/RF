We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. I'm joined as always by my partners in crime, Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. Today we're having a conversation because this has kind of stemmed from a listener question that we've had that was kind of like, is something in the Bible? Is what was said in the Bible or not? We were having this little conversation because I had mentioned just this conversation of like, man, there are a lot of pithy trite things that people think that even Christians say, but that aren't actually in the Bible. And Chris's response was, you want to take the test? And me and Brent said, what? And then he was like, there's a test on my website. Oh my gosh, can you find it? I posted this on my website in 2013. Yeah, it's here. Oh, good, good, good. I posted it 11 years ago. That's so crazy. So first of all, tell me the title so I can number my paper. Okay. Are these common sayings in the Bible? Are these common sayings in the Bible and how many sayings are 34 34 34? Okay, great. Are we going one by one? Are we, we'll go one by one. Like, we'll do it that way. I think that'll be better on the listener than have to go back and do it again. Yes. Great. All right. So y'all ready? I'm ready. Okay. Question one. God helps those who help themselves in the Bible or not. No, no, no, you're right. Uh, that was a quote from a guy named Sidney Algernon or Algernon. Okay. Um, number two, spare the rod, spoil the child. Oh, they're getting hard already. Aren't they? Yes. I think it's in Proverbs. Okay. I, I think no. Okay. I think, okay, good, good. Disagreement, good disagreement. Yeah, I think it doesn't. Okay. I think it's taking something and just bending it. Bending it. Okay. So here's what's interesting. So as a quote, no, it is not in the Bible as a quote. Okay. The phrase spare the rod, spoil the child is not in the Bible. Proverbs 13 24 says he that I'm doing the King James. He that spareth his rod, hateth his son, but he that loveth him, chasteneth him. So no, that quote is not in the Bible. Proverbs 13 24 seems clearly to be where it came from, but it's not there from a biblical, from a strictly biblical perspective. No, from a concept. Okay. You can make the argument. Okay. Okay. Number three, cleanliness is next to godliness. No, I want to say no. No, maybe John Wesley. No one is sure for sure where that one came from. Okay. Number four, God works in mysterious ways. No. Yes. Oh, okay. Again, as a quote, no, it is not there as a quote. Well, here's the thing, but no, but I like it because it's like as a quote, no, but as a biblical or a principle that can be found in scripture. Right. Now I never, I never use the King James normally, but because a lot of these sayings, if you do think it's there, again, I'm going to the King James in Job 37 five says God thunderous marvelously with his voice, great things do with he, which we cannot comprehend. But so concept, does God work in mysterious ways that we can't comprehend? Yes. Quote, no, quote, no. How about this one? Pride goes before a fall. Yes. Yes. Very close. Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before it falls. So again, just crediting our biblical as a direct quote. So pride goes before destruction. Humble here, Bryn. That's right. Are we more and more working on it more and more all the time. We're humble, but competitive. Colson. That's right. I'm still winning by fool and his money are soon parted. Oh, no. That sounds like it could be in Proverbs. There's a thing. I'm going to, what is Colson? Well, you want me to answer first? Yeah. Yeah. First, Colson. I think it's one of those principles. It's like biblically, then we have things. I don't think it's in the Bible. Yeah. I was going to say no. It is not Thomas to Sir in 1573 wrote that. Um, number seven to thine own self be true. That sounds like Shakespeare. Okay. What'd you, what'd you say, Bryn? I said, that sounds like Oprah. No. Oprah may have said it too, but it is in Hamlet act one, scene three. There you go. That's funny. Beggars can't be choosers. No, no, no, no, not there. John Haywood said that money is the root of all evil. No, I've heard you preach to me time. Yeah, there you go. The love of money. There you go. First Timothy six 10 says the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Yeah. That's where people quote that. But man, I heard that the other day again. Really? Yeah. Christians thinks money is the root of all evil. Why do they take up offering? Um, to get it out of your evil hands. That's why. Yeah. Just kidding. Okay. So number 10, a house divided against itself. Cannot stand. Yeah. I think it is. Everyone thinks that Lincoln said it, but it did say it. Well, he was quoting the Bible when he said it. That's right. Mark chapter three, verse 25. Um, I was just thinking about bumper stickers, you know, about, yeah, it's right. All teams that live in the same house. Exactly. I had someone reference it the other day talking about that. One of them has an apple and the other one has an Android that we, we are divided house. Um, okay. All things in moderation. It's okay. I remember this. It's also the concept, but not the quote. Okay. I would agree with that. Okay. I don't even think the concept is there. Well, things in moderation was a moderation was a Greek virtue. Okay. But we rarely see moderation as a positive in scripture. Oh, usually we see things like talking about, um, when Paul is talking about, isn't there, there's a, I'll look it up. We can come back to it. There's like a verse when Paul's talking about, um, excess and he doesn't use the word moderation, but do you know what I'm talking about? Well, in Philippians, he says, let your moderation be known unto all men. So what you're talking about Philippians four or five, if you want to look that up. Okay. But you can check that out. So conceptually, maybe the concept is there for a little bit in that place. Okay. Okay. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Yes. For this sums up the law. There you go. Yes. Matthew seven 12. Very good. That's straight from the Bible. The eye is the window to the soul. Yes. Oh, now I'm second guessing. No, no. The opposite is what's in the Bible. Matthew six 22 says the eye is the lamp of the body, not the window to the soul. The Matthew six 22. Okay. Man. Ready for this one. The lion will lie down with the lamb. Yes. Yes. It is not. Oh, what? Yep. You could look out. I know immediately you're going to go check them. But if you could check Isaiah 11 six or Isaiah 65 25, they have lions and lambs lying down with other animals, but it's never a lion and a lamb lying down together. Isn't that great? That one got me for sure. The first time I heard it, I know y'all are all going to immediately start checking it like Google. Come on, Dr. Google. I did too. I was like, no way. Okay. Okay. That's, that's a good one. It is a very good one. Because I'm like, if anyone listening, he's like, yeah, for sure. Wait, what? What? That's what I did. Okay. The seven deadly sins are wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. The seven deadly sins is not a thing in the Bible. Okay. Agreed. Okay. Agreed. Question. So he said off air. I just, sorry. Chicken. We, I agree. I agree. We just read a different passage that says the seven things that the Lord hates in our last podcast. But no, Proverbs six, 16 to 19 has a list, list seven things. It is not those seven things. So what is it? They're not called the seven. And they are not called the seven deadly sins. Where does that come from? It is a Catholic teaching. It's not even in the Apocrypha. As far as I know now, if it may be an Epoch for not miss that, but I do not know. Okay. Interesting. 17 charity begins at home. Oh, no. I don't think that's in the Bible. Nope. Thomas Brown said that not, not in the Bible. I'm honesty is the best policy. Nope. That sounds like Benjamin. It is Benjamin Franklin. At least he's given credit for it. Like I've heard that Ben Franklin never, never accepted credit for any of these things that he allegedly said, but I think is so such a cool thing. Like a legend. Like I never said that. Exactly. Mark, my son, Mark used to have a t-shirt that had Jesus leaning into the t-shirt and it just said, I never said that. Jesus. I never said that. Okay. 18 honesty is the best policy. Anything that like almost rhymes. I'm like, dubious. Didn't I just don't do that. I just did that one. I just did that. Okay. So you already did that. 19 love the sinner hate the sin. Oh, that's a, I feel like that's a Christian. That's a trope. Okay. But no, I don't think that that's it. I don't think that verbatim as a quote that's in the Bible. No, it is not. I'm not in those words. Many people believe that the phrase originated with, uh, with Augustine in a letter from AD two 11. So it's a biblical concept. The early Christians referenced, but it is definitely not in there. Neither a borrower nor lender be. That sounds like, I know, I don't think so. To me, that sounds like it's part of a poem. That is Hamlet act one, scene three. The borrower is the servant of the lender. I think it's in the Bible. Okay. Wait, say it again. The borrower is the servant of the lender. Yes. Yes. That is in the Bible. Proverbs 22 seven. Um, I got it right, but I didn't get a point ahead because Colson also avoided. Yes. Uh, don't judge a book by its cover. No, nope. No, it is not there by quote. However, did you know the phrase do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment. So do not judge by appearances is directly from the Bible. John seven 24 number 23. Don't let the right hand know what your left, that the left hand is doing. I think it is in the Bible. Yeah, it is. Matthew six three. Um, but it's about giving, not about poor communication, which is usually how people use it. Okay. Uh, forgive and forget. Oh, we've just been talking about this in church. No, no, no, it does not. Uh, we are instructed consistently to forgive others. However, God apparently intentionally doesn't remember our sins. Probably not the same thing as passive forgetting, but an act of not remembering. Um, 25 practice what you preach. No, no, I don't think so. We could see the concept again all over the place. Right. I mean, that's not hard to see the concept and you can see where it came from. Um, but, and Jesus says, do and observe what they tell you, but not the works they do. So in other words, you're supposed to practice what you preach, but that's not a phrase. It's there. Number 26. It is coming up with alliteration for their sermons. That's right. That you get, you know, that's what it was. It was, that's exactly right. Better terrain in hell than serve in heaven. Man, that, no, Billy Joel, Joel, Billy, Joel, Billy, Joel. No, it's not. No, it's from paradise lost. Ah, and it's important. It's not even a biblical concept. Satan does not rain in hell. Hell is created for his punishment. 27 Billy, Billy, Joel's is I'd rather laugh with the center than die. They cry with the saints because the centers are much more fun. That's right. Okay. Great. Um, from only the good, only the good die young. Um, okay. Uh, hey, for someone who doesn't know movie quotes very well, wait, well done with a smooth music quotes though. Good old Billy Joel. Okay. So God is the great physician. Hold up. Okay. I'm not gonna let brands answer. Just like that. I think the concept's there, but I don't think as like a title, I don't think it's there. Colton. I don't think it's there either. It is not. Um, Luke is called the beloved physician and certainly God heals the sick throughout, but nope, not there in the Bible. All men are created equal. Yes. Wait, no, that's the close. Still not right. Yeah. I'd say no. No. It's in the declaration of the end of a declaration of an I mean, yeah, yeah. That other one. Um, a penny saved as a penny earned. That sounds like Ben Franklin all over. But it's not, and it's not in the Bible. Idle hands are the devil's workshop. No, no, but the, but idleness is addressed in the Bible. Yes, it is in negative terms. Yep. A guy named Isaac. Something your great grandma would say. That's right. The devil's idle hands are the devil's workshop. Um, number 31, God's will is the safest. Doing in his workshop. That's exactly right. God's will is the safest place to be. See that's now safest. I feel like is the buzzword there. Yep. It's not in the Bible and worse. The concept is not biblical. If by safety, you mean an earthly concept. Yes. Being in the center of God's will didn't work out safely for Jesus or the apostle Paul or the early church. Right. Um, number 32 children should be seen and not heard. Not in the Bible. It is not. I wish it was in 14. In 1450 there was an old thing. You'll love this, Bryn. There's an old English collection of homilies that says that young ladies should be seen, not heard. Oh, yeah. I knew you'd love that. Um, okay. Number 33. That was me as a child. Just never said anything. I was just never seen. Exactly. She was out somewhere doing something. Uh, 33 followers of Jesus should be quote in the world, but not of the world. That exact quote. Why is it so hard? It's because it's because it's like phrasing. So it's like, man, I, and it's also hard because that's something I've heard a lot phrase. No, but the, like a similar sentence. Yes. Okay. I think it's in there. You think it's there. Okay. Not by that quote. No. John 1519 says, if you were of the world, the world would love you as its own, but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world. Therefore the world hates you. Um, and then John 1714 says, um, I have given them, I have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world. So the concept definitely there, but the exact verbiage does not seem to be there. Man, you're keeping score Colson. If I am keeping score correctly in my mind, which is always not trustworthy, I'm up by one point. Well, that's great. He's not gonna, this one's not going to help. Um, although I have one more to add to it. God never gives us more than we can handle or bear. Not in the Bible. No, definitely not in the Bible and not a biblical concept. How about this one? Laughter is the best medicine. Yes. No, it's not in the Bible, but it is the best medicine. Okay. This is one of those as close one. A joyful heart is good medicine. Dang it. There you go. Oh man. Okay. Very well done. Okay. That's just kind of fun. And I think it's a good thing for us. One part of why I created that quiz when I did apparently 11 years ago. Is that all? It just seems like yesterday, um, uh, was just the reminder how easy it is for us to think something is in the Bible that isn't. Well, I mean, I feel like I've heard those probably said in a sermon or said teaching, not necessarily in a, in a congregational like Sunday sermon situation, but for sure. Anyway, sorry, I'm interrupting you. Oh, no, not at all. No, that's exactly the point I'm making is I think that's a crazy and, and what we are taught and what we are told about these things is, is very impressive to that. We get these messages. I mean, I remember things like being told that it had never rained before Noah or that Adam had the men have one less rib than women do or concepts like that. And when you get told those things, when you're a kid, you're like, Oh, okay. Well, it must be true. And then later you find out it's not true. And an example of that, I think is when you see people walking around with signs that says God hates soldiers or God hates gay people or well, it must be somewhere in the Bible. That's their job is to know what the Bible says. And so they must have it right. And so, which is part of why what the Bible tells us is to test every, I was going to say what the Bible does say is that, that we should check it and we should test it. And so anyway, that's my encouragement is that when you hear somebody quote something from the Bible, one, maybe it's there. Go look, if it is understand the context and and dig into it. And if it troubles you dig into it even more deeply. And then if it's, but you'll sadly, you'll discover on a regular basis, even if somebody agrees with you, by the way, and they say, the Bible says something, go look and see if it does. And fair to try to verify. Once again, if you're a teacher yourself or saying things that the Bible says, make sure that you're not letting people astray. Yeah. Wow. That that will preach because something else the Bible does say in James 3, 1 is that not everyone should be teachers because teachers will be judged more strictly.
