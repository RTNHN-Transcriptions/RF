We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside me are Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. How are you doing guys? Doing great. Doing very well. Wonderful. Very, very well. Yep. Today we're continuing kind of a conversation that we've had and a lot of a lot of these, that's one of the things I love about this podcast is just like a continuation. We're having conversations about deconstruction, why people are leaving their faith, why why is it important for people who have been in the faith for a long time to deconstruct today, specifically, I would love for us to do just like a brief synopsis, talk a little bit of it about what we talked about, hypocrisy, and then kind of jump into some more things, the reasons why people are deconstructing. So I'll throw it over to Chris Sherrod first of all. Yeah. Well, last time we met, we were talking about the last couple of times just that in the churches, in any church, it's always going to be imperfect and you're never going to find a perfect church. So I think you do find a lot of people that are always church hopping because you're just stay there a little while and you're going to eventually, if you actually go and get to know people while you're there, you're going to meet people that you don't get along with or don't like, or that are not nice to you. And so if that's the case, you're always, until you die, going to be trying to find another church. And it's one of those cliches where, you know, where John F. Kennedy says, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. Right, right. But even your attitude going to a church is not what will this do for me. But okay, so how does this church fit? How can I fit in with this church? If it's a solid, healthy church, then what can I contribute versus the consumer mentality that a lot of people have? But anyways, there are legitimate examples of people that really were bad. I mean, they do wrong things and they hurt people and abuse people that you have real hang ups for a real reason. And I think that was our point last time is that, yeah, and we don't want to just make the excuse like, oh, well, they weren't real Christians. Like, you really are hurting. So we don't want to just deny that. But so then what do you do with that though? Does that mean so you throw everything out or do you? Yes. That was when we were talking about, and this is one of the, as we're working through this conversation of deconstruction and reconstruction is that it, I think it is, it is important for us to deconstruct our faith in humanity. Like that, that is a part of, and really almost a part of being a Christian. It certainly seems to be a natural part of maturing as a Christian is that we deconstruct our faith in humanity. And so we stopped looking for humans to do things that humans don't do. And so we're not so shocked and brokenhearted when humans end up failing us, even religious humans, even religious leader humans. Again, there's no, we're not offering up excuses. It's just reality. And so it's not so many of these things don't have easy answers. If they had easy answers, no one would be deconstructing it. It would be really easy. And so sometimes the person who's a jerk to you in the name of Jesus is not in the name of Jesus at all. They're not a believer. And that's, that's legit. That's not always legit. Sometimes they are really believers and they're just human and they're jerks. And if you analyze your own life, you'll probably discover that you are too sometimes. And which was interesting to hear from John Redfern last time. And one of the connection points we noticed was in talking with him and getting to hear from him was that the mature step of identifying with, yeah, you were really hard on me. You were really mean to me. You're really abusive to me today. But, but if I'm honest with myself, I've been hard on people and mean to people, even abusive to people at some time in my life. And again, that doesn't excuse anything. It's just, it's just reality. So deconstructing our faith in ourselves seems to be kind of the next step after deconstructing your faith in humanity. I don't know, maybe let's go in the other order for some people, but, but those don't require us to deconstruct our faith in God. Right. And another, just kind of tacking onto that and listening to a different podcast yesterday, talking about it, not in the necessity, but almost the necessity of like, let's just take an honest look at what we believe the churches that we're a part of and seeing what is like, what is cultural, that is, you know, basically what has like, what is the gospel and what we believe. And then also what is, what's something that we've created. That's like, this is not, this is not true. This is something that we've just made up. Right. And so I think that can also fall into that same thing. So that's, that's really great. Thank you for doing that. What word, or were you going to add onto that before you jumped on your next one? Well, there's always the funny example of if you were stranded on a desert island, like as if how often that happens, but if all you had was a Bible and you were just going to start a church with a bunch of people that you got stranded on an island, like what, if you, again, only went with the Bible, not all these traditions, what programs would you for sure have or not have or how many things are optional? You know what I mean? Like if we're just going to only go with the Bible, you start to realize how many things really are cultural or just traditions that we think it's always got to be that way. Right. Wherein, like in scripture, in worship, it was reverential, like in the New Testament church to have something, have your head covered, have something on your head. Right. But in our culture, it's reverential to take your head off. Right. Exactly. And so for some people it'd be like, you're being so disrespectful. It's like, well, that's our cultural application of being respectful. Yeah. And it shows up in different ways. Yeah. That's, that's, that's all over the place. We run into that all over the place. That's great. Where we were going, I think from there was being honest with yourself. If you're, if you're deconstructing your faith, are you already wanting something to not be true for the wrong reasons? In other words, are you deconstructing it so that you can hold on to a belief that you really want to hold on to or a sin actually that you, that you really want to hold on to? And I think it's an interesting observation about a lot of people is they don't start doubting God's word and then begin sinning. A lot of times it's, I'm sinning in this area. And so now I want to hold on to that. Yeah. And so I'm doubting and I'm doing that with my air quotes. I'm doubting God's word, but it's really because I don't want it to be true. Yeah. Because they can't both, if I'm going to be honest, they can't both. Right. I can't have both of them. So your story with a lady or counseling. That was, that was many, many years ago, a young lady who was a leader in her youth group and a strong believer came in for counseling. And I had worked with her when she was a teenager about other issues, totally other issues. And here now, five, six years later, she came in and said, you know what, I'm really having a crisis of faith. That was the language she used. And we didn't have the word deconstructed yet. Then she said, I'm having a crisis in my faith. And I said, well, what's going on in your life? And she said, well, I've had this boyfriend for about six months and I've just changed jobs and I've this and this. And I just, I just felt like it was appropriate to ask in the moment. I wouldn't normally be this confrontational, but I had known her for so long and under different settings. And I said, so how long have you been sleeping with your boyfriend? And, and her first response was, you know, well, that's not, that's not what I've come in to talk about. I'm talking about my crisis of faith. And I said, I think maybe those two things are, are interrelated. Let's talk about it. And so it was, turns out about the time, well, she just said like, well, okay. Well, it was about this long ago. It turns out it was about the time she had started having a crisis in her faith. And so I just asked, is it possible that, that this crisis in your faith is, you're afraid of losing something with your boyfriend, but you know, that you know that what you're, or you believe that what you're doing is not in coordination with following God. Well, and so one of those two things has to give either your faith either has to, so there's, there's an immovable object and an irresistible force. And one of them eventually has to give, which one is it? Is it the relationship with the boyfriend or the behaviors with the boyfriend? It's going to change. And not, you know, not everyone would agree with all of that or all that process. And maybe even I wouldn't do it that way now years later, but at that stage, that seemed like the right thing and seemed like the right way to engage with it. And, and it knew her well enough. And it, it, it really was significant for her to recognize, okay, I'm making a decision without making a decision. I've, I've made the decision that I don't want to lose my boyfriend. And the relationship with the boyfriend wasn't super healthy. It was one of those, if I don't keep sleeping with him, I think I'm going to lose him. And I don't want to lose him. Whole other issue there in the heart in regards to, you know, a guy who's put you in that position is not, that's not a healthy relationship. Right. But so she had rec, as we began to talk to and recognize that, and she, you know, decided to go back and work on drawing some boundaries with her boyfriend. And, and if I remember correctly, I mean, it's been 15, 20 years since then, is that I think he did, like when she tried to draw some boundaries, he was not okay with that. Yeah. And then she wasn't okay with someone who wasn't okay with her drawing some boundaries based on her convictions. Yeah. And anyway, that was, she was an adult. It was all her decision making, but it was a fascinating interaction. But what struck me was how easy it is for us to, to realize there's something I want in life. And that thing that I want in life is somehow in contradiction with what I believe about the faith. Yeah. And one of them has to give. And so in an effort to help myself get what I want out of life, I began to deconstruct my faith rather than deconstructing my desires. Yeah. And I think too, this was a conversation that we had a few months ago that really kind of helped shine light on a lot of people that I have known that have deconstructed their faith. A lot of it had to do with the radical autonomy piece. And so it was not, it wasn't just, this is what I want to do. It was, Hey, this is who I am. So this is, this is authentically me. And so what you're saying that, or my, my faith crisis here is I'm saying I'm having faith in something that says that what I'm, what I am choosing is wrong or who I am, who I identify as or whatever is wrong. And, and so I remember you said something you might want to clear up how you said it, but it was more like, I believe that you, you are, you know, you're authentically, I can't remember what we can edit. Right. Yes. And so it was like, I believe you're being authentic, but I also believe that you're living out of your flesh. How would you say that? So what I think I said was, I believe you that you're being authentic, but you're being authentic to your flesh. First of all, like I'm, I believe you that you have those desires. Sure. I've got a whole lot of desires that are not right. Yep. And so it's a matter of what do you do with those? And so the autonomy that you were talking about, which it literally, that word literally means self-law is such a big deal today. Everything is, it's all about you have it your own way. You call the shots. And so the big question that all of us have is who gets to write our story, like who's in charge and in our world today, that's, it's like, who does God think he is that he can tell me how to live? And it's who died and made him go. But it's in Romans one after it talks about people suppressing the truth that God is clearly revealed. Right. To protect their own beliefs and behavior. It goes on and it says, although they knew God, they neither honored him as God nor gave thanks to him. So again, it's not a matter of, I don't believe in God anymore. I'm just not going to honor him as God. Right. I'm not going to give thanks to him. I'm in charge and it's this mortgage board thing where I'll go through and cherry pick the parts of the Bible that I like and not the parts that don't. And so that's where I was saying even before that people sometimes you got to be careful when you reconstruct your faith. It ends up being this really liberal, God is cool with any religion and there's many ways to heaven and God is fine with as long as you're in love or happy. It ends up being this non-biblical thing that you reconstructed and that's where Jesus explained that to Nicodemus even back in John 3 verse 19. He just goes, here's the verdict just to kind of boil it down. He says light has come into the world. Men love darkness because of their sin. They don't want to come to the light because their deeds are evil. And Paul echoes that same thing in 2 Timothy 4, 3 and 4 where he says the time is going to come when men won't put up with sound teaching, sound doctrine. Right. The Greek word is healthy, hygieno. It's where we get the word hygiene. Oh, nice. A healthy doctrine instead to suit their own desires, they'll gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. So it's not a matter of what is true. It's what I want to be true, what I want to hear. And it says they'll turn away from the truth and turn aside to myths. And a myth is an invented story, you know, to give an explanation for something. So it's just, I'm turning to something other than God's truth to hear what I want to hear. And doing that, following myths, no matter how honest you are, you'll always be myth taken. That's my dad joke for the day. Wow. That was great. But there are other, like, I think it's cool that I'm glad that we spent time defining truth. And we'll, I know we'll keep hitting on that, but it's like, because a lot of these conversations, as we kind of boil them down, it kind of comes back to, okay, but what do we believe? What do you, what is your standard of truth? Yeah, that was the, I mentioned, I was listening to the podcast and heard myself say something like, I'm sure we'll be, the definitions section will always be a part of the podcast. Yeah, I feel like that'll just be a thread, you know, but I'm glad that we started with that, you know, because that's just kind of, because, and I feel like I was even watching a Ben Shapiro video recently, and he had somebody, you know, come up at one of his rallies and kind of ask him some questions. And he's, his first thing that he says is, well, their first problem was they didn't define their terms. Right. And I was like, Oh, so in a lot of areas in our culture today, defining terms so that we can at least be, have like common understanding is super important. So if you're listening to this, and you're like, I don't really know what, like, my definitions aren't, you know, I don't, I don't know what they mean by truth. Maybe go back and listen to that episode. Listen to the one about faith. So, so we kind of unpack the thing about hypocrisy. Can you jump into the next H on your list, Chris? Well, the heaven and hell one. Yeah. Okay. Or I mean, or do we want to, we kind of started on the hard decisions. I feel like we kind of, yeah, we have breached that. Yeah. Let's stay there for a little bit. The hard decisions of like, there's a, there's a sin in my life that I've got to choose. I've got to struggle in my life. There's a belief in my life. And we remember we talked about the key distinction between, I think we did that within the Christian worldview, there should be a huge distinction between embracing sin in our life and struggling with our facing life and whatever those things are. All of us as Christians struggle with anyone who says they're done with sin as a liar, right? John says so, but we're not done with sin in that sense. And that we, there is sin in our life. The difference is it doesn't own us or define us or, or whatever we're struggling against it, even though we fail. Yes. The distinction between that and saying, no, I know this is sin. I know this is morally wrong, but I'm choosing it anyway. That's, those are two very, very different things within the church, within the Christian life. But even that application only applies to Christians. And for someone who's out there, who's not a believer, I'm sorry for all the times Christians try to modify your behavior. That's not, that's not what Christianity is about. It's not about getting you to stop sinning. It's you need to understand who Christ is and what that means for you. You know, Billy Graham used to say, let God scale his fish after he catches them. But the tendency for us to try to scale them in the water is really silly. Let that be an issue with them. But yeah, I feel like this is this conversation of, and this is not meant to minimize the real questions that it's not an ad hominem attack. We're not attacking the person that we say, they say, Oh, I've got these questions about Christianity. We're not going to say, Oh, you're sleeping with your girlfriend. Like that's, that's not, that's not, we're not just trying to catch you out. Right. It's something for people to be aware of in their own lives and in the lives of the people they love that sometimes people who are protesting are really wrestling with a decision about sin. For example, that's not the only one. There's a lot of them. I mean, it may just be hard decisions about like we talked about, like about suffering. So you might unpack, I think you called it hard times or hard hardship, hardship. There you go. What, how do you see that as one of the things that causes us to deconstruct? Well, this is related to kind of the straw straw man faith that we mentioned a number of podcasts ago that a lot of people have the idea that God, because he loves you won't let you suffer. And then you don't have to live too long and discover that I'm going to suffer, but that has nothing to do with whether or not God loves you. And again, that's, that was a pre, preconceived idea that you brought to your circumstances that actually just isn't true. In fact, the Bible promises just in this world, you have trouble. The price of that. Yeah. And then God uses trials to strengthen our faith, to grow our faith. He's actually the one who is shaking our faith to make it more unshakable. James one talks about that, that you can count joy because it's producing perseverance in you when your faith is tested. I think it's just, there are really, really painful, hard things that people go through that you don't want to minimize and make it sound like, well, but look at the bright on the bright side, your faith is stronger. Right. It really still hurts. And it doesn't, the thing that I, that I shared before about suffering is when I was a waiter and a couple of my sons have been waiters before. If you get your, if your order comes back and it's wrong at your table, there's three options. Either I communicated it wrong to the waiter or they wrote it down wrong or the cook cooked it wrong. But all three of those, you're assuming this wasn't done on purpose. None of us meant to do that. It was an accident. But the hard thing about our belief in God being sovereign and all powerful and all knowing all those things is if something happens, it wasn't an accident. Like he allowed that. And so that's what makes it really hard for people to reconcile, like how could a loving God allow evil? Why would a loving God allow evil? And the argument that's been called the rock of atheism is an all powerful God could stop evil or prevent evil and innocent suffering and all loving God would stop evil and innocent suffering, but evil and innocent suffering exists. Therefore there's not an all powerful, all loving God. So the first one is of course God could stop evil if he's all powerful. The assumption is an all loving God would never allow any evil. That's where you start to go. Well, you might need to clarify that because as parents, we allow our kids to go through suffering. We allow them, you know, to get, I always use the example of their inoculations. I'm getting a shot that it really hurts. It's so hard to take them. My daughter-in-law took my grandson recently for shots and she was filming herself afterwards, kind of talking about it, that she was just kind of weepy, just watching him cry in that instance. And you're in, but you're, it's your fault. You're the one who, you know what I mean? You took them to go get those shots. And so I've used that before as an example. I don't know if we talked about it in here. I said, what would you think of me if I, if I told you I have allowed a perfect stranger to plunge a sharp object into my child? Right. You'd be like, what kind of parent are you? But it's like, that's what happens when we take them to get their shots. Right. They don't know this nurse and I'm, I'm the one taking them there. And I'm usually the one helping hold him down. Right. There's just the look of betrayal on their face. When they look at you. Yes, I remember it. You of all people. That's right. But I couldn't explain to my child why we're doing this. I mean, I could try. Right. They wouldn't get it. They would understand it. Right. They just get the pain. Right. But I'm still going to do it because I love them. Whether or not they agree or whether or not I have their permission. I know what's, I know what's best for them in that. Well, that was a, when we talked about, because this, this issue, the Epicurus is the trilima, the, the, that what you just described. If God is unable to prevent evil, he's not all powerful. If he's unwilling to prevent evil, he's not all good. If he is willing and able, then why does evil exist? And I agree with you that obviously God could stop evil. He could have decided not to allow evil in the universe, to not allow freedom, to not allow. And, and this is such a deep question when we talk about why humans suffer. Like you said, there's a lot of different buckets that can go into that. When I try to explain it, it's reminds me of like the, one of those circus, you know, money cons where you're supposed to throw a ball and it's supposed to land in one of the cups. Right. Yeah. And, and it never, never does, but it's, it's like that. There's a cup that says, oh, I'm suffering because of my own stupidity and my own foolishness. That's why I suffer. Okay. Well, sometimes when I suffer, it's that one, I can throw it in that cup. Sometimes I suffer because of other people's stupidity and foolishness that I I'm innocent of, and yet I'm suffering for it. Well, that I could, okay, there's that one. There's kind of the mass of humanity, decision-makings that humans have done is if you go, well, people died in a snow storm caused by, you know, climate change. Okay. Well, if that's, if that's the case, then all of humanity caused these conditions and someone died in it, like, okay, there's that one then. And you can do so many, is it, but there's some that, that we don't get like, well, there's a, there was a volcano that went off and that doesn't seem to be anybody's fault. God could have stopped that. And that's, or, or in, in, you know, endemic, like, uh, you know, bone cancer in children, the example, or, and even with the ones with humans, why wouldn't God stop those? I mean, when the, when the abuser shows up in the child's room for the first time, why don't they fall over dead from a heart attack in that instant? Why doesn't God? And in the end, it makes sense that it's something that we're questioned and it's something that's hard for us to deal with. And it is, I run into that one a lot, but, but part of what you talked about, the question is, can we prove that God doesn't have a good use for that suffering, that there's not a worthwhile, no matter how horrific it seems, that it's not somehow in the best interest of that person or of humanity or of, you know, God's purposes in the world. And, and the truth is it's really, really tough to, it's hard to imagine for us as humans sometimes to imagine why that was a better thing. But most of us know stories of people who faced horrific suffering and that's what led them to a relationship with God. I have a friend who we've talked about. I've actually already thought about having her on the podcast because she does those, but she talks about, for example, I thought about having her come for the last conversation because she's recently been on a podcast saying I wish she was more comfortable as a stripper than in the church, that she felt more accepted at the strip club than at the church. And, but her, the horrific abuse that she experienced as a child, she would say without that, she doubts that she would have ever put her faith in God. And I don't, I don't, I don't like that. I'm not comfortable with that, but, but if, you know, I can't argue with her about it, obviously, but there is a, how do we know when, when we had the atheist David Smalley come speak at the church and he and I answered questions back and forth. Um, one of my favorite kind of moments in it, cause we had developed a little bit of a friendship was when I threw this question, when he got this question and, and start talking about his own children and start talking about how, you know, he takes his children as a dentist, which is, is kind of a euphemism for torture. We all talk about, you know, bless thank you all you dentists out there who willing to be portrayed as, you know, somehow horrible people for the sake of our teeth. But, um, but as he got done talking about that and about how, you know, this was, I take my children with the dentist, they don't understand why they just know it's torture and it's horrible and they hate me for it. Well, he kind of gets done and says, I, gosh, I feel like I just answered the question in a way that defends your view better. And I was like, no, no, keep talking. Like, yes, the defense rests, keep going. Like that was, that was awesome. Um, but what he's talking about in what you mentioned is there's a third leg to that stool that we believe God's all powerful. And he's all loving, but he's also all knowing. Right. And that's the one that never, no one brings that up in that argument. And so if God is all knowing, when I see something that happens or experience something that happens, um, it doesn't prove that God isn't loving. It proves that I'm ignorant. Right. That's what it means. I just don't know what could, in my mind, I'm thinking, I can't think of a good reason for this. Therefore shouldn't be happening. That's right. Which just proves that I just can't think of a good reason. Right. Um, just like the analogy of the child who can't imagine a good reason for going to the dentist or getting shot or undergoing surgery or even being disciplined. Right. Even, I mean, even as rational as I got as a teenager, there were times when I could not fathom why my parents were disciplining, but they were so irrational and so unreasonable and it made no sense. And it was whatever. And now as an adult, I'm thinking, no, that was pretty good. That was, that was, that was pretty good discipline. Um, because I lacked the perspective, I lack the history. In fact, not to spend too much time here, but, uh, and I think we talked once, I mentioned once on the podcast already about being raised by professors and how that makes me comfortable with, okay, God gets to be the expert. Yeah. Um, but man, after studying the book of Job, which is about this topic, the most ancient, probably the most ancient book in the Bible and talking about this topic is that at the end, when talking with an atheist, I think it was with David, when he, he said, God is, I mean, God is so mean to Job at the end of the book of Job. And I'm like, wow, I don't see that at all. I see God being super gentle and patient and a little bit snarky. Like when God's like, so I'm curious, I'm trying to remember if you were there when I created the earth and I'm thinking back and I don't think you were there, Job. I'm just, no, I think you were like, and then asking questions like, well, maybe you can help me with some easy ones, Joe, like how does, how does, where does snow come from? Can you explain that? I mean, we still use weather phenomenon as the example of chaos theory to this day, that is beyond our ability to predict perfectly. God says, so I'm, I'm curious if you, are you on top of that one or can you do the easy stuff? How about let's do a really easy one. Can you catch a crocodile? Maybe just go out and grab me a crocodile real quick. Can you do the easy ones? No, those are the easy ones. The, and the easy ones, by the way, include things like can you spin stars into space, ignite them and set them on fire and send them into space? Like, oh, you can't do that one either. In my mind, God is saying you like the perspective, you like the understanding, you like the raw intelligence that even if I tried to unpack this for you, you couldn't get it. Like trying to explain vaccines to a child and they're not going to get it. Try to try to explain discipline to a teenager and I'm going to get it and trying to explain taxes to me. I'm not going to get it. I'm just, you know what, can you help me answer this question? Cause I don't, I don't get this. My brain doesn't do that. This is about deconstructing humanity again. It's about the problem of human suffering and the fact that we don't understand it is either a God who needs to be deconstructed or humanity's pride that needs to be deconstructed. The third option, what if I lack the perspective to understand why God allowed this kind of abuse? And I agree that that's hard and that it's a step of faith. I agree that it's hard. It's not blind faith. It's not ignorant faith. It is a faith that says, I know there are experts in the world. There are people who get this. This makes sense. And yet I don't, I'm not going to fully comprehend what God's doing here. That's okay. And I think to remember that that's essentially what the cross was all about. Like, God doing something about suffering. Like sin coming into the world is what brought suffering in the first place and death. And so you've got this reminder from the book of Job or a lot of Psalms that God, scripture is not silent on this issue of suffering. I mean, a whole lot of songs. Oh gosh, no, not at all. And Isaiah talks about he's close to the brokenhearted. And so you, you, you get the sense that God is not ever heartless in any of this. But again, he's got a really great, great reason, even in Lamentations where it talks about God is the one in Lamentations three, one of my favorite, like first 20 verses are him talking about how tough things are. But then he turns and he says, but this I call to mind and therefore I have hope the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercy has never come to an end. They're new every morning. Great is your faithfulness. But a few verses later it says, but though he caused grief talking about God, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his, his steadfast love, for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men. And that word willingly literally means from his heart. In other words, it's how I'm feeling when I'm taking my kids to the doctor to get their shots. It's like, yeah, this hurts. I don't enjoy watching you go through this. So, but I'm going to do it anyways, because I know something that you don't know. And that's ultimately what we'd look forward to in the book of revelation that he's going to wipe away all the tears. There's no more death, no more suffering. And he ultimately solves that problem of evil, which if you've never read, I don't know if we mentioned it in here, but the problem of pain is a book that C.S. Lewis wrote that's all about suffering and evil and gives an explanation. And he talks about what you said, Chris, about couldn't God just make that guy drop from a heart attack? He says something along the effects of all matter in the, in the, in the realm of a bad person would, would be really unstable because if he takes a piece of wood, he's going to hit you over the head with all of a sudden it becomes soft as grass. And I mean, like, yeah, exactly. Sound waves around you wouldn't obey the words coming out of your mouth of their evil. Like, it's just, I don't think we want the world that we think we want. Right. Like, do you want a world where every time you're about to do something that God disapproves of, he stops you and you can't. Right. So that's where a lot of people are selective in the kind of evil they want God to stop. Oh yeah. That's a, there's no doubt that one problem with that is the question of where do you stop that? Right. So, okay. Oh, okay. We can all agree that child sexual abuse, God needs to end that one. Right. Okay. We can all agree with that one. And again, that starts with the pride of we all need to agree on it. Yeah. But, but what about just misbehavior and, and what about if God, I mean, very much so people who are deconstructing their faith probably don't want God to say, okay, everything I disapprove of, I'm now going to make impossible. I'm going to step in. You can still want it. You can still pursue it. I'm just going to, every time before you fulfill it, I'm going to damage something so that you can't. Yeah. And, and that would be, that's just not freedom. And so I get the idea that makes, that makes some sense to me as well. And even with your perspective, people go, well, but who I sleep with is different than, you know, starving children in Africa. But it's like, well, but that's, according to you, you have the different, right? You delight in that. This is worse than this in verses, but what does God think? Does God think that sleeping with someone you're not married to in a covenant relationship actually really is wrong? Right. And do you want him to stop you every time? Yeah. That's a, that's, that is exactly part of this conversation. When we talk about hard decisions, it is can, can I accept God's perspective on these things? Am I willing to accept God's perspective on these things, even if I don't fully get it? And, and that's in my mind, that makes sense that I'm not going to fully get things. That that's, I don't know how much of that is just my intuition or that I've been so wrong so many times every in my whole life. I mean, I just feel like that's so easily done that my feeling of no, I have to fully get this does. I don't have a high meter for that. And, and I don't know again, how much of that is just like that we showed, Colson was that with the other podcast with, yeah, when we were showing the video of the people bouncing the ball, the count, the number of times the white, the people pass the white ball or whatever the people in white pass the ball. The selective perspective test or what it's like, visual, whatever. Cause what is it in there? There's a gorilla moonwalking bear. I've seen one, it's like a moonwalking bear and you're like, how did I miss that? And so it's, it is amazing how people will like a huge percentage of people. And so again, it's so easy to be for us to be wrong. It's just, it seems like a healthy, rational perspective to acknowledge. I feel like this about this, but I could be wrong about that. And I feel like that goes back to, again, to deconstructing those things. And that, that comes true in regards to everything from human suffering, which I consider to be very understandable and, and I, I'm not comfortable with it and I don't like it, but again, that's, I don't, that's, I'm talking about me again, all the way to why God forbid certain behaviors between humans. I don't have to understand the ramifications of all of that. I don't fully understand one of my, one of the examples I also love to reference and I just got a comment on it. Cause it, it know it's outdated a little bit now, but some of you guys may remember when there was the huge oil spill that it was the oil, the actual container had broken off at the ground and it was spilling oil up from the, like the BP one. I think that's right down on the coast of Texas and how everybody had an idea for how to fix it. Do you remember that? Like for some reasons it stands out to me that Kevin Costner had a plan for fixing it. Like, I don't know what that's like, that he was like, here's what you gotta do. And, and I thought about my idea immediately was like, why don't they just drop a big concrete block on it? I mean, this shouldn't be, but the thought of asking somebody who was an expert in whatever paleo oil, I don't even know what oceanographic, I don't even know what the title for that would be. Oilology. Oh, no oilology. Anyway, but them sitting, me sitting down with one of them, again, this is my professor mindset sitting down with one of them and saying, Hey, why don't you do a big concrete block on it? And having them look at me and go, what do you know about barometric pressure? Right. And what do you know about it at a mile down in the water? Like nothing. I mean, nothing like, okay. What do you know about hitting a one foot square object a mile down in the water with something like, Oh, is it that it's that? Wow. It's that, huh? Like a nothing. I mean, I don't know. Is that what you would have to do? Like, what do you know about the pressure of the earth's crust on a pool of oil under the, Oh, that's, that's a thing too. Wow. That at some point he would say, or she would say, Chris, it's not going to work. You can just trust me that it's not going to work. Or we could spend the next 20 years getting you educated up to the point where you would know why it won't work. And, and again, I'm so comfortable with that mindset that I can watch a horrific thing happen as a therapist. I hear the worst things that happen to people's lives and say, that's, that's unthinkable. I have no idea why God allowed that. I cannot fathom allowing it, but I also can't catch a crocodile and I'm willing to accept that maybe God does understand it. And in fact, if I could add Samuel Colts, my other example, like I've always thought when it comes to behaviors that when Sam Colton, Colonel Colt, who invented the revolver, like when he gives you advice, like don't point the cylindrical in at yourself and pull the trigger part that you should listen. He invented it. I mean, he created this thing. He invented it. So his instructions should be very valuable. Given that God, I believe designed humanity, him saying, Hey, don't, don't do sex this way. Again, I, I'm, I'm willing to accept that maybe he knows what he's talking about. No, I don't promise. I don't say that I always obey him. Like I actually believe, I believe it in my behavior, but I'm willing to accept that there's something there he's got that I don't. And the struggle comes in also with people saying, but I really do feel this. I really do want this. I don't want that. And that's, I think that's what ends up the tension that they're feeling that they end up giving in a lot of times I've had staffers before Colson, I've talked about that. Um, one of them particular who worked for me on, on leadership, his, his struggle was homosexuality. And he knew that while he was working with us and we had conversations very real and how are you wrestling with that and how can I pray for you and what's your accountability and stuff. But then a couple of years later when he had, you know, was in a different environment, he came out saying that he'd embraced homosexuality and God's fine with it. Me and God have had a good talk about it and, and I'm good with it. And I just think it's that example where he finally just said, I can't live with this desire is so strong and I, and I want it to be okay. And so I'm going to change what I believe about the Bible versus let the Bible change. And there's a really great distinction that Rosaria Butterfield and Sam Albrey have weighed in. I don't know who said it first, but are these desires how you are or who you are? And I think in our culture, any desire that you have, they're like, Oh, that's got, that's who you are. That's your ultimate identity versus no, this is what sin has done to me. It's I, we all have messed up desires because of sin. And so desires that I have, I think Sam puts it this way, desires that I have, they go against God's word, aren't evidence of how God has made me, but how sin has marred me is the way he puts it. So again, we're back to what you mentioned earlier, Colson, of I believe you that you have those desires, you're being authentic, but that's just how you are. Like, and it's not an excuse, but sure you have those desires, but that's what Jesus came to redeem you from and to give you a new heart for you to empower you to conquer. And so you can't just say, I have these desires, therefore I get to fulfill them. You get to deal with them and bring them to the Lord and wrestle with them. So it's how you are, but it's not who you are. And that's why it's a struggle because if you think that that's your identity, then anytime people question it or say it's wrong, it's like, well, you're attacking who I am. And so defining even what it means, what do you mean by who you are is another issue. But I just think a lot of times the heart, the heart of the problem is the problem of the heart. That's ultimately what you're dealing with. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructive Faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.
