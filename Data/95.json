We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined by my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. Chris Legg is here with me in studio. Bryn Starnes is at home. And guys, I'm glad to be back with you guys. We are talking today a little bit about, we can do air quotes for current events. But Chris sent us a text this morning saying, oh, I think it'd be valuable to listen to Albert Mohler's podcast. And we can talk a little bit about it. And so it kind of revolved around this idea of a book that came out about de-churching and that concept of Americans and American believers leaving the church. And so that sounds pretty, at least germane to what we're talking about. So worth a discussion. Chris, do you want to just kick us off with some initial thoughts on that? Yeah, that was, it was interesting. So Dr. Mohler was actually responding to two different news articles that came out, I guess, today or yesterday. I think one was in the New York Times. I don't remember what the other one was. I think they both were. One was Nicholas Christoff. It was an opinion piece. And both of them referenced the great de-churching, which is a recent book by Jim Davis and Michael Graham. I have not read the book yet. But basically what they're doing is they're making the claim that in the last 25 years, we have seen a greater decline in Christianity, or at least in church attendance. Then we saw an increase in church attendance during three of the great awakening periods in the United States. And immediately as I heard that statistic, I did the kind of the same thing that Dr. Mohler did, which was like, I mean, there's a whole lot more Americans now than there was at those. What would the percentage numbers be? And so I don't think they could make the same case. Again, I haven't read the book, and maybe they do. Maybe I'm wrong about this. They couldn't make the same case that the percentages, the percentage of moving away from the church would be greater than the first, second, first awakening, second awakening, or the Billy Graham crusades. But obviously, regardless of that, regardless of the claim, they claim, I think something in the area of 40 million people have left the church in the last 25 years. And remind me, were they also talking about like other houses of worship? I feel like they reference that. But anytime in America, you're talking about church attendance. I mean, 10% is meaningful when you're talking about 40 million, that's 4 million people. But 90% of church attenders or holy site attenders, I guess, holy place in America are Christian. Okay. Oh, so then, yes, okay, I see what you're saying. So, it's a, so the numbers are if it's 40 million, and if it's evenly broken out, and I am 100% sure it is not evenly broken out. But that church attendance, because I know that because for example, in the Protestant evangelical world, we are not seeing the same type of numbers that some of the mainline denominations are as far as people leaving. It's still significant, it's still meaningful, but it's not. We are the evangelical church in America, at least the last statistic I saw. Now again, I've not read the book, maybe they contradict this is that evangelical come, uh, well, the evangelical churches are maintaining essentially related to population growth. And so we're not losing or gaining a ground in the American world. But again, that's not okay. That's not like that's like, Oh, good, whew, like, because if millions of people are even leaving other denominations, they're, they're not coming to the evangelical denominations at a high enough rate that we're growing. Right. And so we are losing people, but we're also gaining people are leaving the back door and coming in the front door. So it's a very real thing that we are losing church attendance in churches around the country. Now where we are here in Tyler, Texas, which we describe as the diamond on the cowboy on the buckle of the Bible belt, right? You can't get any more of that here. And so you would think we would be the last place as, as, you know, we'll be the last kind of hill above the waters when it comes to church attendance. Um, but we see it here too. I mean, it's even, it is much more normalized for people to not be embarrassed, so to speak, that they're missing church on Sunday morning, that the social equity that comes with attending churches, um, is would that, I, we do see that being lost here. And I've got to assume that's the first step is when people stop worrying about missing. It's not that they're not a part of it. It's not that they don't care. They're just like, I mean, it's fine. And then next step will be why bother? Yeah. And I don't know if the book engages with COVID. Um, because we obviously saw a lot and, and Dr. Mueller mentioned that too, um, about the question of COVID and, and I mean, cause we definitely, we saw, we have people, so here we are 2023 and we have people who are just now starting to come back from COVID and other people who left during COVID and who have not come back. Um, it's amazing to me that I'll talk to people. I talked to a couple of the other day that was saying like, yeah, I was, when I asked him about where they go to church and they, they said, Oh, we go to South spring. And I was like, well, that's cool. Now I don't, I don't know that I have seen y'all around that much. And they were like, well, okay. So typically we watch it online. And so it's like, Oh, that's great. I mean, I'm glad you're watching it online. You might, you might go ahead and, you know, come on in as well, because you're getting a very small piece, a very small percentage of what church is intended to be if it's online. Yeah. Which is an interesting point that he covers of like, why I feel like there's a lot of reasons that people are leaving those that are leaving. There's a lot of reasons for that. And I think he does cover like COVID is one of them, or at least Albert Mueller did not that the article did, but, but it's interesting to think about, okay, what does that mean about our view of what church is? That was kind of one of my takeaways, you know, of like, well, is it something that in our mind is optional or replaceable, or is just providing us something that another aspect of life provides us, which then, you know, is a, is a view of church that needs to be challenged. Yeah. Yeah. Cause what I think of is similar to a lot of American culture right now, which I think has just been, it's been a trend for a while is the consumption. You know, we are, we are consumers, materialistic, whatever you want to call it though. But it's like, if your mindset is what can I get out of this? And it's like, well, I'm just going to listen to this sermon that I really like and listen to music that I liked. And it's like, well, you can listen to that at home or say, and again, I'm not trying to hate on people that are, that are, that are watching. I'm more just saying like, if that's your mindset of like, well, this is what church is rather than, Hey, I'm an, I'm a member of this body. I am a participant in what's going on. And my absence is, is robbing other people of God's design. And I'm, I'm missing out on what God's true design is for this, you know, body of believers. I think if you have the consumption mindset, then it's like, well, one, that, that seems quintessentially American right now. And then two, it's, you know, you really are missing out. Right. Yeah. And then when you combine, not necessarily, assuming this is people's reason, but when you combine the cultural shift that's happening right now with all the issues that are really tough to tackle, like we've been talking about, sometimes it is easier if the church is not aligning with culture, if it's viewed as just a community, and the church is supposed to be community, but if it's just viewed as like a social interaction that is optional, then when it becomes inconvenient or it becomes like our lives are too busy or those social things that are contradicting or coming into conflict with culture, make it uncomfortable somehow to engage with, and all of those things combined makes sense why it's easier not to. Like I said, not assuming that we know the reasons that people aren't attending, but, but it makes sense to me why, why we would find in, in church attendance, you know? Yep. And, and it's intriguing to me. So we've seen this, the date, the timing is what drew my attention to this. So because of my role as a therapist as well, I try to keep an eye on, you know, mental health and suicide statistics. And just recently, I was trying to see when they released it. I don't know if there's a date on this, but the CDC recently released the 2022 numbers. Because, you know, they're always right cutting edge on top of things. We're here in August of 2023 and we're getting 2022 numbers anyway, but of suicide and statistics. And it's interesting that we've seen this massive decline in the de-churching in the last two decades, which, which maps right on top of when we started seeing suicide rates increase in America. So for like 15 years, they had been going down across the board. And then about 20 ish years ago, they started climbing. And, and so looking at some of these numbers are just, you know, it's pretty wild where we see, we see tiny decreases among a very small populations, maybe most shockingly in this last year, so that, and this is, there were people writing about this before, but that they predicted that the child up to college age would actually decrease in suicide and depression during COVID. And that's actually what happened, apparently, suicide rates and despair and depression rates actually went down among the 10 to 24, 10 to 24 is too big an age range. I don't know why they would do that. It should be 10 to 18 and 18 to 24. That kind of thing is silly, but, but in general, there was a decrease. And some people were predicting that because it turns out being at home with your family is healthier for kids than being in the social situation, the social pressure sometimes, especially for high school kids. And that, that, that caused a lot of anxiety. Yep. That caused tons and tons of anxiety. And so, and that there's something healthy about being at home and being around your family and that kind of stuff sometimes. And that does not for every family, for every situation, but it is, it is intriguing that there was a, there was a little bit of a connection there. And of course, what we've known for, so this is the way, what I think is means we've known for generations that kids who have parents who are invested and involved in their lives and in their education are healthiest. Well, a lot of parents had no choice but to be invested and involved in their kids' lives education for the first time during COVID. And sure enough, we saw that increase. I think we'll see that go back to its other numbers during this year. So the late, late in 2024, when we finally get 2023s numbers, we'll get to see, we'll probably see that catch back up. I can be wrong about that. I hope that's obviously not the case, but, but we see increases among, you know, significant increases among people 45 to 64, people between 65 and older. Both men and women saw a significant increase in suicide during this last year. And this has been a continuation of a pattern. So it's just, you know, it's pretty, pretty heart wrenching. I don't, I don't say there's a one-to-one correlation between the fact that people aren't going to church and therefore their suicide rates are up. I just think what we're seeing is less and less stability in most people's lives. Well, and there are studies, right, that show that anxiety, not that it is a cure, but I lower people who are consistently in a church, a part of a church body report lower records of anxiety and depression. Yes. Yeah. And marriages are a quarter, like 25% more likely to be healthy and survive. And that's for people who are engaged, not just, you know, just have a name that you're connected to. Because that was one of the things that blew me away years ago was, and we should have guessed at this, but that, you know, claiming to be a Christian does not meaningfully change, like your marriage satisfaction scores, your depression, anxiety scores, that kind of stuff. But living as though you are a Christian does. Now, some of that is just sociological because living as a good Muslim or as a good Jew will have some of the same positive effects on people. But so some of it is just sociological. It's not theological, so to speak. It's sociological. I mean, it's theological in that God made humans to live in family systems and in packs and herds. And I mean, that's how God made us. But it isn't surprising. It shouldn't be surprising to us that when we have the stability of what God teaches us, and to live that life, that community life under His shepherding, that's very, very powerful. And what we're seeing right now is we're seeing, you know, kind of like years ago, some people, I'm sure John and others have heard me say this, but that one of my fears for America was the fact that we, you know, I'm part of the 13th generation of Americans, Gen X, and we were the first generation not conscripted into war, into the military. And I was like, okay, war is bad. I don't like war. I think war is bad. At the same time, there may be some negative cultural consequences to having several generations in a row not be conscripted, not have to face combat, not have to experience those things. Like, I think it's bad. And yet sociologically, there may be some things that cost us like, I assume combat is pretty good for weeding out the type of people who shoot up schools. You know, those people probably don't play well with others and well, and they probably don't survive combat. And so we're likely, and I don't know this, I'm making this up. So what are the effects on that? Well, what we have right now is people who don't like church and don't believe in Christianity and even think that they're negative influencers waking up and going, this may be bad for our culture, that we have so many people leaving the church. And that's purely for the sociological aspects, but, and which is something Dr. Moller unpacked, which of course we would agree with that, you know, belonging without believing, that's, you know, you're not really belonging. You don't belong to the church unless you also follow Christ. And the only reason I come to church is because I follow Christ. I don't come just for the, well, and there's donuts and coffee. So I will admit that that's part of my motivation too. But the, um, but that wouldn't sustain you coming for, I mean, me, not for not for the, not for the amount of time that I come. Fair enough. That's for sure. That's for sure. From plenty of times when there are not donuts, you know, that's true. I do come at times when there aren't done. That's not as happy. I wouldn't, you're not as happy on those days, right? We all know the truth. Yeah. Um, yeah. So, uh, but that's, I don't come to church just for the social gathering. Um, I come to church for, because I'm gathering with other people who follow Christ. And if those things were taken away. Yeah, I would still follow Christ. Yeah. You'd still. Yeah. And yeah, have and did and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, that's for sure. I agree with him that Christianity is not merely a belonging. It is a believing, uh, or it's a belonging to Christ, not merely to a church. Well, because I think, I think when it comes to belonging, like what we're seeing in culture is that I think we do desire belonging, but if something comes in to conflict with that, where it's like, okay, my belonging to this group has to come up against, you know, something else, whether it's like my discomfort or me adopting something that socially makes me belong less or like whatever it is, it makes sense that belonging without belief isn't enough because you can go and find belonging somewhere else. Like you can, and, and arguably from our perspective, it's not the same kind of belonging, but if that's the only thing holding you there, then it's like, well, I really need sleep. Like, well, Trump, that if it's not accompanied by belief, and I think that's why we're seeing there are other groups in the states that have a large number of people who are joining them because they do belonging really well, but you don't have to sacrifice some of the other things that you're called to sacrifice when you want to belong to the church body. Is that, you know what I mean? Uh-huh. And so, and we've talked about before there, there are circles in the U S that arguably do hospitality and belonging better than some churches, you know, um, and so, and that's a conviction to us as a church, as a capital C church, but it makes sense to me that, that if it's costing you something and there's not a belief accompanying it, then that would be an exit from that church and belonging would make sense. Right. Well, and I think that's, um, I think that's part of what the challenge is, is that, is that some people that right now, I think what, and what one of the articles at least that was, he was referencing pointed out was the guy was saying, you know, I'm not a practicing Christian. Um, and I never really have been, even though I went to church, you know, it was kind of, I remember his example was pretty fascinating of, I don't like, like, I never really held onto these beliefs. I don't really believe that Jesus rose from the dead, et cetera. But I sure do like singing in church, um, and that kind of stuff. And then it was, how do you, um, like, what do you do with that? And he's, and then he's actually said, I don't think I can get my friends to gather together and sing under normal situations. And so I think, I think that's part of the issue is that what they're discovering is there isn't an easy way to get it to go. Um, not to the same thing commitment anyway. Yeah, exactly. And so I, I feel like that's, that's part of the issue here is that they're facing and that's, that's tough. No doubt about it. Well, and I think some of it, so I was reminded the other day of our conversation with Mark, because I was reading through the great divorce by CS Lewis. And there was an excerpt that reminded me so much of our conversation with Mark Legge about how seeking is so popular right now, but not finding. And I think that there's, and I can read part of it because it's obviously very poetically described in CS Lewis's book, but. Yeah. Did you hate that guy? He talks. Yeah. But it just reminded me, that kind of reminded me of the situation, because I think when we have a culture that emphasizes seeking, we're also inadvertently keeping ourselves from that type of community, because community means that we have to be bonded over something, you know, like having a shared belief is what typically bonds groups of people together and friends and like, yeah, I don't agree with my friends on everything, but with all my friends, I have something shared. And, and if you don't land on any belief whatsoever, then you are, you're trying to be open-minded and, and essentially keep yourself appealing to all people. But what happens is then you have no depth of community with anyone. Yeah. And I think that's just contributing to, to this problem of like, we, like he's saying, no one's going to sit and sing with him, you know, just for the sake of, of singing, typically, if there's no belief backing it. Yeah, I agree. And I think that's not a, I mean, I think that's part of the challenge that we face for sure is how do we not somehow claim, Hey, come here and find a good country club. And right, you know, it's not merely, as we say at the church, it's not merely a dysfunctional family. You know, it's not, that's not, that's not all you're getting out of this. This is really meant to be a living out of a personal relationship with Christ. And, and so it's not just, Hey, we're going to get together and sing, which is obviously that's great, but that's not the, that does, that's not the end. That's not the end of the plan. So anyway, I think there's a good, there's a good conversation to be had here. I, I think there is something unhealthy about and not healthy for our country. This great de-churching that's happening. And it was intriguing that many of the things that they threw out there as reasons why we're strongly linked to the things we've talked about on this podcast, the close-mindedness attitude, or the Christian stance on certain issues of sin. You mean people, reasons that people are listing that they're, that they're de-churching. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so it's interesting. I don't know how I feel about the idea that, well, what if people started to come back just because they were despairing or discouraged or lonely? Well, I mean, in one sense, that's why a lot of people came to follow Christ in the first place is they had realized all the other wells were dry. And so I don't, I'm certainly not opposed to that kind of thing. If that's the reasoning, why people come back is because they're lonely. But what a weird thought, the thought of coming back to church for some reason other than Christ. Yeah. And how that would have to be corrected very quickly. Like, no, no, we're not. This isn't just a gathering of people. This is a gathering of a family with a father who has adopted us. So it'll be an interesting thing for us to wrestle through if that day comes when people are coming going, listen, I just want a place to raise my kids. And sadly, now, even as I'm saying it, I'm thinking, gosh, how many people are already doing that? And how many have been doing it for 50 or 60 years? And that's part of why they're following their unchurching is because they weren't capital C churches in the first place. We've talked about that before, that the early church fathers already began to identify the difference between the visible church and the invisible church. The visible church being people who are present and the invisible church being people who follow Christ, no matter where they are. And I think the visible church, every time there is any pressure, the visible church shrinks. Because why would you come if it's going to cost you something, if the only reason you're coming is that you gain something. And so the only reason you would keep coming is if you were willing to pay everything in order to be here. And that's the actual Christian calling is not we come because it's offers some social equity. If it does, great. If it doesn't, fine. Like that's, and we've talked about how it's intriguing. This is why I talked to some of my friends in the African American church, which I wish I look forward to the day. I'm sure I'll be dead before it happens when that delineation no longer makes any sense to anybody. But right now it still does. And so the African American evangelical church and talk to some of my pastor friends and said, you know, you guys have more experience not having to be here. And I think more experience not having the social equity. You have more experience not being welcomed in your communities. It wasn't because of your Christianity was because of your ethnicity, but being a Christian did not save you from it. And so like, you know what it's like to not to literally have probably have white people not want a black church in their neighborhood. And as broken and messed up as that is and infuriating as that is, I am sure that is the case. Well, what's it going to be like when you have white people telling white churches, we don't want your church in our neighborhood. We don't trust you. We don't think you should be here. We think you devalue the property or whatever it was that they would say. And how do you like we're the, I feel like the white evangelical church is going to have a lot to learn from the black church over the next few decades as we have to join them in being, you know, kind of unwelcome in our own home, so to speak. Yeah. And I think we have to do the hard work like we've been encouraging on every topic when it comes to Christianity. But I think this is no exception when it comes to doing the hard work of asking ourselves, why do we go to church and teaching our families and even speaking that truth to each other? Because I think that's like a very basic question that we don't ask a lot of times. It's like, even if we love Jesus, like, but why is attending church together important? Like, why is that something that is it optional? Is it something that, you know, is like twice or, you know, 50% of the time is okay? Like all these questions that I don't think we think to ask ourselves a lot of times of like, okay, if someone asks me, why is it important to be a part of a church body? What would I say? Because I think if we haven't thought through that, then even if we love Jesus, attending church can become cultural for us or like, just a, it's not a practice that we hold dearly and even value, like highly, it's just something that even though we love Jesus, we do and because of technology and whatever it is, there are other options of like, well, you know, I'm an extrovert, so going in person makes sense for me instead of like a deep theological answer of like, why are we called to be a part of a church body? You know? Yeah. That's good. And I think, again, all those other things show us it isn't merely attending that does it, nor is it merely claiming to believe something that does it. It is believing and living it out that really changes our lives in powerful ways. So I'm intrigued to do a little more research on Michael Graham and Jim Davis and what their perspective is and maybe get on there, read their book. And if we do, we can discuss it here as well at some point. I think that'd be valuable. So for those who are out there, I got to tell you guys, I've had, I don't, I think three or four different people who have commented to me recently about their appreciation for this podcast. And so I underestimate it because if, you know, for me, it's just whoever's in the room, like, hey, this is, this is good stuff and fun for me. And I like discussing this, but I have been intrigued at how many people, believers, and in a couple of cases, non-believers or people who are deconstructing or wrestling through that whole process, who have said something to me recently, including a couple like who are total strangers who I didn't know at all, who found me either through this or one person who had come to visit the church because of this podcast or had sent their friend here because of the podcast. So I'm really encouraged by that. I'm really encouraged to think that there are people who are wrestling, whether believers or not, and are encouraged that we're willing to have these conversations. So I really appreciate that. And we love getting feedback. So anybody who's out there, we would love to know feedback no matter what side or what part of this process you're in. In fact, there's, if I remember correctly, there's a student who I was talking to who is looking to, is considering doctoral work along the lines of the deconstruction movement and had found us that way and was reaching out. So just some neat conversations that have been happening with that. And I look forward to us continuing in these. And I think research or podcasts like these show us that this is still a, like we're not done with this job yet. And there's still a need for this. And I'm so excited about the guests who we've had and the new guests we'll have. And I'm hoping we get more and more questions as well to help guide us with where we need to go next. Because I think we're doing, we're going to look at some of the more of the conversations about people who are deconstructed, whether in, you know, live or interviews online or books or, you know, websites or whatever. So please send us stuff and we'll love to, we'll try to look at it and give a response to it. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
