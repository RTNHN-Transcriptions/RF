We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, and alongside me are my partners in crime in studio, Bren Starnes and Chris Legge. And you might be noticing there's some extra noise in studio. We've got some cleaning going on. I think we've got some carpet cleaning going on on the floor where we're working, but I did a quick test and the audio should still come out clear. There you go. So anyway, if you hear that though, and you notice a little difference. You didn't notice it. Now you will. Yeah, exactly right. I figured it's probably good to say something, right? Yeah, I agree. If you if you hear something, it's probably just a strange noise your car noise your car is making. Oh, that's right. That's immediately to the shop. We'll just edit it. Well, your brain might be making a weird noise. Your brain mind might be doing that. Anyway, guys, right now when we're recording this, you guys spent some time at camp at student camp for our students and preteens here at our church. And we kind of, or Bren was mentioning beforehand, just kind of a cool thing that would be, I think, beneficial for us and our listeners to wrestle with. And it's kind of the idea of a camp high mountain top experience. Can I throw it over to you, Bren? Yeah. And just kind of kick that around. Let's talk about that. Sure. I, yeah, we went to Shepherd of the Ozarks in Arkansas with 250 people, something like that. Oh, the, the biggest preteen and student camp we've done so far. And it's always an amazing week. I love we both Chris and I both love student camp. Yes. For many reasons. But I think coming home, there's always a lot of processing that happens and should happen. But one of the things I was processing even for myself as an adult who's done camp multiple times was kind of that low or that sadness of, Oh, now we're back to normal life. And now I have to get up and go to work or make breakfast for my family or go back to school or whatever those things are that we're coming back to. I even experienced a little bit of that this weekend. And I thought it would be helpful to process just what it means to have a mountain top experience. Because I think sometimes if we don't have good tools to process those experiences, I think we have them throughout our life, but they are sometimes few and far between. And if we don't have good tools to process them, they can aid in deconstruction because what can happen is, and we can talk about different things that happen depending on, you know, personality or whatever it is. But I think sometimes we come home from those experiences and then we start doubting our everyday experience or dreading our everyday experience and either wishing that all of life was a mountain top or wondering if the mountain top experience was real on some level. And so I just kind of wanted to unpack that because I think it's really helpful, not just for students, but for adults. I think we all have those experiences, especially in the faith. What does that mean? How do we have good tools to process those? Why are they important? And just how much should we think about them? Because those things are good. Like it's not that camp and having that high is inherently a bad thing. Right. Is that right? I mean, I or I would argue that it's not. So we can have that conversation. I think that's a great place to start. I happen to agree with you, but I don't think that that's an assumed statement. I think because I think very often people will delineate between the mountain top experience and you use the word normal, which I appreciate, typical, but that's not normally the word people use is they will say real life. Yeah. You've got to come back to real life. It's not like being at camp. It's not like whatever. You got to come back to real life as if the mountain top experience is not real life. And I would say, I think sometimes it is. I mean, if you're, I don't know about you guys, you know, I had a relatively a pretty good Christian family growing up, but we're pretty skeptical and we can be pretty jaded. And so I think probably sometimes the camp experience for me was, was if it wasn't overtly treated as, Oh, that's cute. Interesting. That you've come back with a camp high, which is what it was described as. And then it was at least kind of subtly always communicated like, well, it's not going to last. And my friends, that was certainly the case. I came back and went to go hang out with my friends after getting back with camp. And I was like, Hey, we ought to do a Bible study and let's talk about Jesus. They're like, Oh, that won't last. Yeah. Well, you must've just got back from camp. Like it was always treated that way as though it had the fact that the emotions of it weren't long lasting somehow made it not real. And so that's a, that's actually, there's a, the program that I teach with the forge class. I actually start one of the very first things we start with, with a book called screw tape letters is the question, is this real life is being in a forge program for eight months and living in community, living in a camp setting, living in all this, is that real life? And I'm telling you the vast majority of them immediately are like, no. And their speakers will say, Hey, when you get back to real life someday and, and their, and their parents will say that. And people, people even all around them will say that like when you, well, you know, just get ready for real life when real life hits you. And, and I'm not saying valleys aren't real life too. They, they're also real life and normal days are real life. Like that, I, that, I mean, the first one I would love to correct with people is, is that somehow because the emotions don't last, that makes them less real. And that actually is the nature of emotions. Emotions don't last. And so the fact that the emotion doesn't last is more evidence that it was real because, you know, I mean, you, we're all married. So how long have you been married right now? Uh-huh. Eight years. Eight years. Yeah. Eight years. Eight years. We've been dating for 10. Okay. Same. Yeah. Or 11. So here we are, you know, I can't remember. We're on a similar. Yeah. Yeah. I'm coming up on 30. And, and so I don't know about you guys, but that honeymoon high has never gone away. We are still just as ecstatically excited and that's never changed. Like that's good. I'm good. I'm like, both of them are looking at me like, like, uh, how much do we call him out on the podcast? I was like, I was just going to be like, okay. Yeah. I'm honestly like, okay, well, I cannot relate. Anyone else. That's, that's because that is real with human beings. We, that's us. I mean, we, we have high days and low days and we have honeymoons and we have, you know, divorces and almost divorces. And I think that's the nature of humans. I think it's the nature of life. Um, uh, not to turn it into a mini sermon, but, but I, I, I was, it was shocking to me one day to realize the nature of the fallen world is that the natural state of everything is death. That's what it means. I assume that's what it means to me to fall in the world is that the natural state of anything is death. We are, I had, I had a very, um, I don't know what word to apply to this, a client who had a dark, dark tendencies with their language. And he said, we're all on a six minute timer that's counting down toward our death. We restart the client timer every time we take a breath. So you're six minutes from dead right now. And at the timer starts when you take a breath and if you ever let the timer run out, you're dead. And so you have to take a breath to restart the, whatever you are out there, take a deep breath and start the timer back up. But I did not, but still, yeah, it's, but it's not wrong. Yeah. We're on a three day timer for water. We're on a probably three day timer for sleep. We're on a 30 day timer for food where, I mean, that's just, that's, that is the nature of it. If the three of us just sat here for a week, they would, they would, I mean, I have some coffee in front of me, so I would last a little longer than the rest of you because I have a liquid. Oh, well, the Brinsco, the water bottle. So she'd be, she would outlast the other, you're done four days, you're done. And so we could not just sit here for a week. We would have to go, uh, get water. Um, and so it's, it's like wild to consider that that is the natural. So of course the natural state of any emotion is to change. So if it's a highlight and you have an epic moment, and that's what we mean, I assume by mountain top. Yeah. I was curious, I can't find evidence online, whether the term mountain top experience comes from the experience of, if you've ever been a climber and saw no guys ever experienced that we've done a climb to tall mountain and the euphoria that comes from reaching the top. I have, I've never done it. I've never like had that summit euphoria, but I've heard, I've had friends who've described it as like, it's just, it is euphoric to reach the top. Have y'all done it? I have. I don't think I've done, I haven't done a 14er, but I've climbed some smaller. Okay. And is it just this, just an emotional, like, Back in my Everest days. Back in your Everest days, right back then. Like, can you equate it to something? Um, it's a, it's like, it's, it's the accomplishment feeling. It is the thing. It's like, it's that accomplishment. We did it. I can't believe we pulled it off. It took hard work. The end was glorious. Yes. And then, you know, the view that's there, I'm assuming I've not run a marathon, but I assume it would be similar to that feeling of like, I can't believe I pulled this off. I accomplished this. And then with a mountain top, you have the, also the advantage of usually an amazing view and the camaraderie of, we did this together. If you did it with other people, but I actually just searching mountain top experience, I would say the first three or four pages that I glanced through, none of them referenced that. Interesting. They were all referencing Bible passages about people on the mountain top. So it actually makes me wonder if it's like the word talent, like the word talent in English. It's not an English word. The reason it's the word talent means talented, like that you have skill sets is from the concept of a talent, which was a coin or a measurement of money that Jesus used to tell a parable of the talents, meaning whatever God has given you. But it's come to mean in English, your skill sets. Well, actually there is no concept of that outside of the biblical picture. It makes me wonder actually if the mountain top concept comes from Moses, Abraham, and their mountain top experiences. And so that we describe these great moments in life, these epic moments as being like, you know, Moses meeting with God to get the 10 commandments or Abraham meeting with God to sacrifice, to not sacrifice Isaac or Jesus and the amount of transfiguration. I wonder if that's, if the actual etymology is from the biblical account, which should that be intriguing? So then, because I'm tracking with you then like, okay, let's call this what it is. This is still real life. It's just a mountain top experience. Why is it hard then for people, especially people I believe that grew up in the church who may, let's say, you know, from a young age have gone to VBS or something like that, a vacation Bible school or camp or, or some, some sort of basically where there's an emotional experience and then a, and a call for response. Yeah. And then I know, I know of people and then I've also felt it personally of like, okay, I've made a decision, whether it's like, I'm choosing to be saved or I'm choosing to, you know, go in, you know, to devote my life to ministry or what, you know what I'm saying? Like that, that kind of vernacular. And then it's like next year rolls around and I feel similar. And then it's like, okay, well, should I respond? And then it's like, I just, I've talked to people and it's like, you know, I've, I kind of did that, but then the next year I kind of felt it again. And so, and so I guess again, we, we, we're coming back to emotions or, you know, an emotive response to what's happening, but I don't know what, what, what that triggers in your brain. Do you think we could discuss really, and you covered some of this, Chris, but we could discuss why it's important to have those and then go into kind of how we struggle with the fact that we also have them. Yeah. Is that, is that a good idea? So yeah. Why? Well, going from Chris and your conversation about scripture, if we believe that it comes from scripture, even there are examples of it in scripture, I think we can go back to that of what do we see in scripture as the reason that we have it. And even, yeah. So what would you say is the benefit to having mountain top experiences? Some things that come to my mind is you use the marriage analogy and that makes a lot of sense in this perspective to me because we all need times to reconnect with our spouse and make good memories and connect on emotional level and pause and stop the rest of normal life to remember, to point our relationship and remember the things that we love about each other and recalibrate. All of those things are positive in a marriage. And no, not every weekend is a retreat weekend when it comes to marriage, but I think we would all argue those are important. And those are something that often gives you energy to continue going through normal life the rest of the year. And in the same way, it seems like that is what a mountain top experience could provide spiritually is it's not that it is false emotion or somehow fake. It's that we need, we always need time to stop and recharge and reconnect and remember why we follow the Lord and pause the busyness. We talked in the junior and senior class yesterday about pausing the busyness of life and the pace of life that Americans have, particularly we often have to intentionally pause and stop and you know, Shabbat, stop to connect with the Lord and hear from Him because our busyness often drowns that out. That's like my initial thought. Yeah. What do you think? I mean, going off of my own personal experience, I know that it was these sort of mountain tops were important for me because it reminded me of why I was following Jesus and that I was not alone in this. And then it was also just like, I don't know, I mean, maybe a glimpse of what the Lord intended in some ways of like, you know, really communion with others and communion with Him. And it's like, and what was also, I mean, it was a testament now that I look back of like how fickle I am to, it's like, what was, what made it a camp high? What made it, you know, what made it made it so important or emotional for me? And it was like, oh, well, aside from not getting great sleep, it was having really deep and intentional conversations with guys my own age. It was spending time in God's word consistently. And then it was also giving God praise. And it was like, those are those things like, while you talk about, you know, quote unquote, real life and like, oh, you got to go back to school or you got to go back to this. But it's like, but I think another reason why it was such a shock to my system was I didn't have, like, okay, I went to church, but my rhythms of, of connection with God in my personal relationship, especially during that time in my life, I think it's looking back and say, oh, that's a testimony to how starved I was for connection with the Lord. Because when I was connected to Him, it was like, this is amazing. And then, but I'm now going to go back to how I normally do my life, not make a big change. That's a good point. But and then the other part of it that I think is cool about a church camp thing is that you're, you go with a community and then you come back with people who you share community with. Yes, totally. Versus mine was I saw these people once a year. Right. Right. And I, you know, I was looking forward to it and there was really wonderful memories there. But then I think I was starved for some of that back. So I don't know. Yeah. That's kind of, that's, that's my anecdotal two cents. Yeah. So there is a, it's, it's like, I mean, you can, you can think about the biblical concept of feasts of holidays and festivals. So we as humans need seasons and we need reminders. We need, and part of this is because the valleys are real. And by the way, to use the word that young people use on video games now, the grind is real. Like it is a, the, that used to be talked about, about actual life, not video games that, that like the grind is real going and doing what needs to be done day after day after day, even though you're making tiny amounts of progress and it's, it can be exhausting and boring and, and it's not very exciting. Like that, those are real. And so, and so are the mountaintops, the Epic moments. And that's, it's like saying, when you go like, oh, it's not real. Like the sex thing, desserts, not real. Yeah. I mean, it just, just because exercising is real. And just because, I mean, I'm literally sitting here was thinking like the moments when the cleaning goes off and you feel the cleaning goes off and you're like, oh, that feels so good when that, when that cleaner turns off, that, that is not no less real than when the machine is running. It's, it is a, there are times we need to do that. Marriages, more marriages would make it, maybe the vast majority of marriages would make it if they would understand this concept of, yes, there are times as Bryn well knows and you well know of, of doing the grind of, I mean, taking care of a baby is a, is a grind. It is a, every few hours, there's something to be done. Every few minutes, there's something to be done. And when you have little kids, every few seconds, they're, they're demanding something and that grind doesn't stop. And so if you don't get away, if you don't have date nights, if you don't have a time to go to the movie with friends, if you don't have poker night, if you don't have picket, whatever it is, those, the, the minor version of mountain top experiences, then you're not going to make it. And as humans, we need those, we need those to look forward to. But that's like the, the entire biblical holiday, holy day, prescription is all based on this reality. Even the Sabbath, even the fact, like you said, even that every seven days they were supposed to stop and relax and spend time with the key people in their life, stop the grind for 24 hours, like that is God gave those to us. And so of course we need the, we need the weekly ones. We need the small daily ones that we're supposed to sleep every night. We're supposed to spend time with family every day when possible. But like those are, those are necessary. And that's, that's just part of human nature and it's part of the nature of a fallen world. So fallen race in a fallen world. And, and to treat the high points as somehow not real, but then to treat the rest of it somehow as real is just an obvious mistake. And so yes, decisions made in a high point are hard to maintain in the grind or in the low points. They still can be. I mean, that's, I think as mother Teresa who talked about living in a valley for the last like decades of her life and never feeling like she got to come out of it and yet holding fast to what she believed was right and true all the way to the end. And so those are both are, are all are very real and they're, they're reality. And we need the high points if we're going to have the low points too. And we need those high points to, to invest in and to, to strengthen us. And then he goes about like what Dan Ray said the other day, that was, that was really cool when he referenced like we, I wrote it down, like the fact that our decisions are largely going to be emotive. And so that's just weird to think like, it doesn't mean the decision isn't real. The fact that it's connected to emotion, it's just not the whole, the whole thing is not just emotion. So of course you're going to go, yeah, we intentionally, and this, I think this is part of it too, is we intentionally craft situations to create the highs, but we don't have to craft the ones that create the lows. We can, I mean, I, I do once a year with a group of students craft a low, but, but the, we craft the high and therefore it feels less real. Like it's, but life can, you know, life can already, a lot of times throw us the lows. That's right. The lows are going to take care of themselves. There's a fallen world. Right. And so, yeah. And so we go, oh, everything about camp is, you know, we, it's all supposed to focus into the spear point on Thursday night when the kids are, you know, most invested in most, and then you give the gospel and then they respond and they like, well, yeah, welcome to being a human. Of course, our condition affects our heart and our soul and our mind, but the fact that it is an emotional time, a positive time, that would be like saying the honeymoon night wasn't real because of all the emotions. Like that's just dumb. Now I'm saying, I don't mean to minimize it. I know so many of us, I was too raised to think of it as, well, you know, we're, we're manipulating this or manufacturing this. And yes, you're right. We are, I manipulate positive experiences in my life all the time. I manufactured them all the time. I, I, I schedule nights with my friends and dates with my wife and, and all those types of things and, and hang out time with my kids that are meant to be positive. And you cultivate an environment for all of those. That's right. That is the goal of, of what you want. Exactly. If I don't, they won't happen because we live in a fallen world. And there are moments of joy that we don't choose of surprise joy. Um, and those are awesome too. But of course, if we want that, that's going to be necessary. So I, what I would love is with anybody who's, who would be out there, who would go, oh yeah, I had that campite and I put Jesus into my heart at VBS or whatever. But then I came home and went right back to my sin. Like, yeah, I mean, we're not surprised by that. I'm not surprised by that. And I would assume that's the, that's a super common thing because there you're certain, like you said, you're surrounded by good influences and friends. And there's these positive moments and there's the social encouragement and, and all the different things. And, and is it, is your conversion real? Well, I mean, maybe you know, and only you and God know that the answer that question, but it doesn't mean what you experienced wasn't real. It doesn't mean that unless you know, it wasn't unless you're like, um, this will make people like me. If I do this, well, maybe, maybe then that wasn't real. I don't know. But, but don't go back and say, oh, now that I see how they created that at camp, that makes it not real. That's, that's again, we would not say that about anything else. This food's not real because the chef spent so long manipulating it into tasty forms. Therefore it's not really real. It doesn't really affect me. Donuts aren't real because they're glazed. Like, yes, they are. And Brussels sprouts are real, even though they're terrible. Like it's a, both, both are true. And if I want to have, you know, sometimes by the way, and that, that also applies like, and sometimes we need to face hard times, um, because those are real too. And we need those in our lives too. But anyway, I, anyway, just, just, just, yeah. Yeah. Well, kind of going back to your question, Colson. So then what would you tell people? I think this is your question. You can rephrase it if I'm remembering incorrectly, but so then for people who are on the other side of a mountaintop experience, what would you tell them in the moment where they're kind of coming down? Okay, great. Um, so you know how the apostle Paul in Romans, I think it's 13 says make no provision for the flesh. I think the opposite is also true. We should make provision for the spirit. And so just like, uh, you know, I have all these passwords on my computer and blockers and on my phone, all that kind of stuff. And I've said before, like, I'm, I'm an adult man. If, if I want to look at something inappropriate, I can drive to Best Buy, pull out my credit card, buy something that will give me internet access and see what I want to see. Like no, no one can stop me from doing them. 50 years old. So, but, but the insanity that would make me want to look at something inappropriate probably isn't going to last through all those steps. You know, when you've got that, that, that werewolf feeling of like, ah, got to engage with whatever my addiction is. Well, there's a bunch of barriers between you and your addiction. Well, your, your addiction may not be willing to push past them. It's the, you got money, you know, spending a day, I had a friend who used to freeze her credit card in, uh, and so in a block of ice so that she couldn't use until it melted. And she'd be like, even if I put it in the microwave or something, like I gotta be careful not to melt the credit. But she's like, by the time I got the ice melted, a lot of times I realized I don't need that. I don't need that. That's making no provision for the flesh. Wow. So you don't store alcohol. If you're an alcoholic, you don't store little Debbie snacks. If you're sugar addict, like I am, right? You don't give yourself access to pornography. If, uh, if that's something that like that you're tempted by, like I am. And so, so to say, okay, so I'm going to make all these blockers, that's making no provision for the flesh, but the spirit, the opposite. So when you're insane, you want to make, when you're sane, you want to make decisions for when you're insane. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay. The same thing is true. When I'm sane in a happy, positive, joyful way, I should then actually make decisions that are going to maintain. So honeymoon, great time to plan your date schedule for the rest of the year. Like that's a great time to do that. You have a great night together. You enjoy each other. It's a great time, whatever. That's when you want to start setting the disciplines in place that are going to maintain that we're going to go on dates. We're going to have these fun times. Um, and that way when you are in the valley or when you are in the grind, you've made decisions that provide for the spirit. You guys know I do a poker night once a month and every, almost every time I'm like, Oh, I don't have time to do this tonight. Like there's just, and I have guys will tell me all the time, like, Oh, I wanted to come this month, but such and such came up and such as this. I'm like, or the month or the what quarterly lead pastors meeting that I go to every time it's like, Oh, so much. I need to get done. I don't have to, but well, it's on the calendar. I better, I got to do it. Right. I hosted in my house or my church. I got to do it. Well, I get there and I'm there and 10, 20 minutes in, I'm like, Oh, I needed this so bad. And so it's the same thing. Part of how you do it is you need to discipline yourself to have. And so when you come down from the mountain top, that's a great time to sit down with someone who you love and go, okay, here's some commitments. I'm thinking you guys are do the thing where you write a letter to yourself during the mountain top and then have someone mail it to you like six months later. Oh, I've never, well, I've never chosen to do that. I think it's wise. It's happened where it's like, you need to do this. So do this. And then, you know what I mean? But I, like, I'm not thinking about it. I'm not thinking about it in the, in the mountain top. If you do that, I mean, I tried to journal in mountain top, so it's essentially, yeah, you go back to it sometimes. Yeah. Okay. So we used to do that all the time at camp. The last thing at camp is you wrote a letter to yourself. Okay. And then we would put them all in envelopes. You self address stamp. We don't see it. Yeah. And then six months later we mail them all. And, and it was so cool for the kids to go like, Oh, I made this commitment and I've fallen off of that. Or I, this is what I was telling myself then. And I've forgotten the truth of that. And, and so, cause it's from you, you know, you can't question your, and, and anyway, it's, that's part of it. But I, I think that's part of why we need them is to recommit to what we know is best. It's why we do need those seasons. We all mock, I, me and myself included, knowing new year's resolutions. But we need to make commitments at different times. You know, it's like, okay, I'm going to start on Monday. Well, okay. Actually start on Monday. And you go like, Oh, I blew it by Wednesday. Okay. Well then start next Monday or Thursday. Like that's, that's humans. Yeah. Um, it's in CS Lewis's crew tape letters. It's called the law of undulation. Human beings undulate. We have up, we have down and the demons desire is to make us believe the one we're in will never stop. And so, um, I'm in this camp. Hi, I'll always have this camp. Hi. It'll never go away. It's like your senior, you know, the last song in Greece, we go together, we'll be friends forever. Like, uh, and so like, no, no, you won't, but, but you think you will and you believe it. And then when you're not, it can be so disheartening like, Oh, but if you knew up front, no, the friendship you have with those high school students is so real and so deep and so powerful. And it's so wonderful. And it also probably won't last the rest of your life. Both are true. It's not that one, Oh, and so many adults are like, Oh, the friendships you have now that they don't matter. They're, they're going to go away. You're going to know, of course they matter. Yeah. But they're probably also going to go away. Yeah. And so all of those things are true simultaneously. And we don't need to minimize any of them. We, we have highs and it's awesome to have a high and you probably won't stay high forever. And then you're going to have lows and lows can be really, really painful. We learn a lot of the lows, but we can be really, really painful. We write good poetry there. Um, and they're also not going to last forever. Yeah. So, and it just reminds me of the things that we've talked about a lot on this podcast of it's also that more, much more important to remind yourself of truth and realize what you're putting your hope in because those things are good and real. But if your hope is in the high or the emotion or the friends that are going to last forever, and then they go away at some point and your hope was in that, then the low is going to be even lower. And it just pushes us back to even our relationship with the Lord, not our feeling about that relationship. That is such a great point. That's we, that's back to our themes. That's we, another thing we probably need more of us need to deconstruct is our faith and our feelings that I trust of how I feel. And that's sufficient to carry me through. And no, it's not that our feelings are. And that is so countercultural. Yes, it is. For right now. Because your own experience is all emotive, you know, like we were talking about with Dan. So that's awesome. Motions are fantastic and they're vitally important and they're super powerful and they're a wonderful gift from God, except when they're a curse sometimes. But they also are still just emotions. And to treat them as somehow more real than external reality is a mistake. They are real, but they are real emotions. And that's, man, those are some great, some great reminders and good things to think about. So if you're one of those people who had a mountain top experience, and then you walked away from it and you're like, I just don't, it wasn't real. We'd really encourage you to really evaluate that, look back on that and see if it's just the jaded attitude of your family and friends about it that makes you think now it's not real. Is it something like that versus no, it was real and you need to recapture that. And we'd be happy to talk with you about it and pray with you about it too anytime. Good conversation guys.
