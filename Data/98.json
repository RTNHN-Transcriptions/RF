We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. Today, we're jumping into the conversation about biblical contradictions. Sounds good to me. That's awesome. This has been really what our show is about. We've been defining terms for a long time. We've been trying to understand people's stories and search for the truth. And so we're not, we're not ones to shy away or I hope we're never ones to shy away from looking at apparent contradictions, looking at the Bible and facing those questions or conundrums or whatever you want to call them head on. And so I'm excited for us to dig into some of these questions. And so, Bryn, can I throw it over to you? Because I think you had a question to kind of kick off our conversation. Yeah. Yeah. I was just wondering. So when it comes to just after kind of looking at some of the main websites, well, I guess there's a lot, but main websites that cover contradictions and some of the most common claims of contradictions. My question is, do you feel like there are different headings when it comes to contradiction? So for example, some of the ones that kind of stood out to me, and I'm curious, Chris, if you think that that they're able to be divided this way, and I know it depends on the person and how it affects them. But to me, it seems, and I haven't done an exhaustive reading of all the contradictions because what people claim are contradictions, there are thousands, but yes. But it seems like they can be divided into a couple of different headings. So for example, two that came to mind were one seemed to be verses that are out of context. So if you haven't read scripture a ton, or you just pull a verse out of a whole passage, like Christians are known to do sometimes. Anytime a verse is printed on anything, I feel like we run that risk, but not hating on graduation cards, but you know. I can do all things through a misquoted passage in scripture. Exactly. So I feel like some of it is that where it's like, okay, if you are in a culture that throws around a lot of Christian expressions or sayings, and they're taken out of context and you haven't had a lot of training when it comes to, or haven't done a lot of reading the Bible for yourself, some of them seem like that to me where it's like, okay, well, but if you had read more, you would know that that's out of context. So that's one. Another one that comes up seems to be like a misunderstanding, which is close to out of context, but just a misunderstanding of like a biblical concept. Or if you're just looking at the words and not the big picture, biblical concept of like, how can that be true? And that, and it's like, yeah, if you're just looking at the words and you don't understand the biblical framework and the biblical narrative, then it would seem like a contradiction until you understand more about who God is or the story of salvation or something like that. And then it comes together beautifully. So those are two that seem like headings and then a third being, okay, this does seem like at face value. I don't understand how these two things are possible and it's going to take a lot of digging or a lot more digging. Yeah. So yeah, I think, I think there are, you know, the, what I encourage people to do when they run into, when they hear about, so there's kind of two different things here. When they hear about a contradiction in scripture and the first thing they need to do is go look at it because a decent percentage of the time it's just, it's just not there. Like right. It's that someone in good faith or bad has claimed something is in the Bible that just isn't in the Bible. Okay. Yeah, that was other. Okay. And so that's the first thing you got to do that we want to do is go look at it. And so that's going to be one. And then a huge percentage of the time it is intuitively, it's either a problem that the claimant has with the Bible. And that's been one of the difficulties right now as I've been searching around for a really good list of alleged contradictions in scripture. And the problem is, you know, some of them are, you know, they claim to be thousands of items long. And yet the first one is like, God is angry a lot. And that's a problem. Like, okay. I know that's, that's a problem you have. That's not a contradiction. That's not actually a contradiction. And or yeah, it's a contradiction that God is loving and yet also kills people. Yeah. Like, okay, no, that's, that's not a biblical contradiction. The Bible clearly presents a God who reserves the right to take human life and who is also patient and yet also just, et cetera. Like that's not an actual contradiction. That's just a general, I don't like this about the God the Bible presents. Yeah. That's not a contradiction. I have seen those. So I feel like that's a good thing for us to define then, what is a contradiction when we mean contradiction? A contradiction is going to be when within, within the right content, within the correct context that you've got two things claimed that cannot both be true at the same time and in the same way. So this is the classic definition, the classical understanding philosophically of what a contradiction is. And, and one of our basic understandings of logic is what's called the law of non-contradiction. Two things, two things cannot be true if they contradict each other in the same time and in the same way. And so I think I mentioned last time on the podcast, like if I said, I'm, I'm, I'm being a bachelor this weekend. So you know that I'm not literally claiming that I'm, though I've been married 30 years this weekend, I'm suddenly not married. Like, you know, I'm using that term euphemistically. So that's not an actual contradiction. You could say like, no, no, you can't be married and be a bachelor at the same time. Okay. Yes, you're right. I'm not literally a bachelor this weekend. Does that make sense? True. Okay. So at the, so that would be, that's, that's not an actual contradiction. Though if, if someone made a claim on it, it might have to be explained like, okay, that's because I'm not, I'm not using the word in the same way both times. Does that make sense? And so, so those would not be, those would not be a contradiction because it, the two things can't be true at the same time and in the same way. Or if I said, I was a bachelor. Well, that can be true because at one point I was. And so those are, you know, if, if I wrote in an article, you know, in 1992 that I was a bachelor and then someone said like, no, no, you're not a bachelor because you been married 30 years. Like, no, no, those are two different times. So it was true about me at this point. Now it's not true of me. So that's the idea of a non-contradiction. So for example, a self-contradictory statement has to be false. So if I say no sentence has five words, well, I've now created a sentence that has five words. So it is a self-contradictory statement and therefore must be false, nonsensical. If I say there is no source of knowledge except empirical evidence, that's a self-contradicting statement. Unless I have empirical evidence to prove that empirical evidence is the only source of knowledge, it's a self-contradictory statement. And so it can't be true. It can't be accurate. There are no, there's nothing that is true. That's a self-contradictory statement. If it is true, it is therefore false and vice versa. So it's a self-contradicting statement. Therefore, it must be false. It must be a ridiculous, absurd statement. So what we would need be looking for in the Bible is two things, at least two things that are claimed at the same time and in the same way that cannot both be true at the same time. And so, for example, one we will certainly run into is how did Judas Iscariot die? And so in one account, you have Judas being hanged to death. And then in another account, it says that he fell and burst open. So can those both be true at the same time and in the same way? So could you argue he hanged himself and after he had hung a few days on a noose, his corpse rotted enough that he fell and that will explain how he burst open was because of the decaying that had happened to his body. So is that a contradiction or not? Well, it doesn't have to be because there is a way to understand both of those accounts in a way that both work, that they can both be true at the same time or in the same way. Is that making sense? So that's what you've got to do is you've got to find an example of something that cannot both be true at the same time or the same way. And I'm going to acknowledge upfront, some of these will feel either picky or someone might say like, oh, that's a stretch. Yes, that's that which is fine. And we're even going to talk in a minute about what we will call true contradictions, but how that's a cultural context. Even that is a cultural thing. What we would consider a contradiction in the West might not be considered a contradiction about 2000 years ago or 4000 years ago in the Middle East or now in the Middle East. And so a lot of what we look at contradictions or errors in the Bible are errors only in the 21st century Western mind and would not be an error to the original authors. And that's problematic when we ascribe an error or contradiction to like if I say, which I heard, by the way, I'm not, I don't have time to do much sports stuff, but usually I can safely say use the example, the Cowboys got killed yesterday. Although I hear they didn't. I heard they won't. I heard they killed 40 to nothing. 40 to nothing. Wow. So who were they playing? The New York Giants. Okay. So if I said the Cowboys absolutely slaughtered the New York Giants yesterday, no, neither one of you or anyone listening is going to go, Oh my gosh, did someone call the ambulance? Who got, did anyone get arrested? Oh my gosh, that's totally inappropriate. You can't do that at a football game. Like no one does that because in the correct cultural context, you know precisely what I mean. And so for example, we used it, we were teaching through first Samuel, we ran into, you know, one place, you know, Saul has an army of several hundred thousand soldiers. And then literally the next chapter, he has like 600 soldiers. Well, it's very likely big. We know from military war language from 3000 years ago from other cultures that it's not uncommon that when, what they do, when they mean it was so big, you couldn't count them all as they just throw a massive number at the wall. And no one actually at the time probably thought really 200,000 that's amazing. He should have conquered Egypt then because no one has an army that big that at the time his audience would have known that meant, man, he had a bunch of guys that not literally 200,000. Now, if that's accurate, and I'm not, I don't know for sure that it is, it may be it's 200,000, but if that's accurate, understand that would not actually be an error any more than me saying the cowboy slaughtered the giants as an error. It's not an error. It's a contextual or cultural language device. And sometimes we know those and sometimes we don't. So of course, I'm going to charge me to try to give, we're going to try to give the Bible the benefit of the doubt, but we're not going to go overboard with that. Just so everyone knows if they're listening, if you're someone who has contradictions that you really struggle with, we want to look at them and engage them honestly. But so let me give you another couple. There's pre-prescriptive versus descriptive errors that like God, people will say, well, God says that there should only be a man, one man married to one woman. It seems to be what he's saying in the book of Genesis. And yet, you know, David has extra wives. Abraham has extra wives. Jacob has extra wives. Like that's a contradiction. Well, it's not a contradiction. It seems like a contradiction of standard. Right. But it's not because one is descriptive. Abraham did have several wives. Jacob did have several wives. That's the description. It's not prescribed that we ought to do the same thing. It doesn't ever say like, and God said, Hey, you know what, this is a much better way than I did it. Like we don't ever see that. And so the description, the difference between a prescription and a description is a common, people think that is a common source of contradiction. I'm left with, I don't know why God does not openly condemn that they do that. Right. Which I'm fine with that being an issue for somebody like, well, God should really be condemning that. One, again, culturally, sometimes God condemns things scripturally without saying condemn. Like it never seems to work out well when people have multiple wives. That may be the lesson, one of the lessons we're supposed to get is, yeah, that's not going well. So one, you check to see if it's in the Bible. Second, you see, is this a deep, is this a deeply cultural held thing that we would understand? Is it something that can be integrated like the death of Judas? And then or like even, even when it comes to integration, I even saw one that was like, well, do faith, does faith save or works? Which is it like this? It was listed as a contradiction because scripture talks about faith and works, but that's like a perfect example of integration of like understanding the bigger picture. But they quoted like Ephesians two and then Romans three talking about like, you know, through faith and then you're not justified apart from, you know, like those verses. Anyway, so integration. Go ahead. No, that's, that's, that's a really good point is that that's one that is a like, that's a great example of a perceived contradiction. That is, it just isn't, it's a contradiction. It's a tension that the scriptural authors are wrestling with themselves, that, that literally they're wrestling with what is the role of faith and what is the role of works and and whole chapters in the Bible written wrestling through that tension. I consider that almost bad faith to claim that that's like to go to, to claim that that is a contradiction in the Bible when it is a difficulty that the Bible is honestly openly, the authors of the Bible are honestly and openly engaging with. Right. Like that's, that's irritating. If someone says, you know, well, the Bible, you know, the Bible is, you know, only gives easy answers to certain things and there's a contradiction like, no, it's the passages there are about this very issue. So anyway, the other thing I'm curious to is like with, I think a lot of these contradictions can appear marginal in a lot of ways, right? It's like, it doesn't alter the main, the message of what's going on. Like as far as Jesus dying on the cross, those types of things. Or am I, am I, is that an accurate statement of like, I feel like from the conversations we've had, a lot of the contradictions that we've looked into don't change, like whether it, whether the article is supposed to be the, or, or she or he, you know, like those types of things, it's like, okay, those sort of, I mean, I guess, and that's another wrong idea of a contradiction. Then I'm not, I'm not with, I'm not going into the same definition, I guess. Right. Right. No, I'm just saying like a lot of those things, if somebody's like, yeah, well, but Christians, like they, they kind of shy away from sometimes addressing these contradictions, right? Do you think that some people don't go into it, like searching for contradictions because it's like, well, if you look at it with honest eyes, most of the time it's not altering the message. And so if you're trying to live about the message, you might not even care that much about little contradictions. Right. I don't, does that make sense? I'm not trying to make, I don't know if what I'm saying is right. I mean, I think I'm just like, I feel like some people in the Christian faith are like, I mean, I, I don't really spend a whole lot of time thinking about this. And I feel like people who have the questions might be like, why don't you spend time thinking about this? This is a, yeah, I, there's a lot of fun with the idea of, and you have to be careful with this, but that often sometimes Christians will almost take the attitude of like, I don't care. Right. And which in some level is okay, because if you come at it from the correct perspective, meaning if this turns out, if listen, if you turn out to be right, that, you know, I don't, I don't know that, that Sam first, the second Samuel says that, that Joshua B.M. killed 800 men, but first Chronicles 11 says he killed 300 men. And of course there's a way in which those could both be true. Or 800 is definitely 300. Exactly. Or it's like, but Goliath was this tall, or he was this tall. Right. And it's like, okay. Okay. So if that's, if that's the way that you're going to live, then you go like, okay. So if that's, if that's it, and it turns out, no, there actually is a true actual contradiction. Um, that, that it would be, it's totally appropriate for a Christian to say, yeah, that really has no bearing on whether Jesus lived, died and rose from the grave. It is not true that any, any type of contradiction anywhere in scripture means we have to throw the whole thing out. That is absurd. That's an absurd statement. Or that anything in scripture has to be, that something in scripture has to be taken figuratively. Therefore, everything has to be taken figuratively. Of course not. That's absurd. Um, but those are, those are the times I'm telling you, you will be so disappointed when you start digging into the preponderance of these contradictions are so poor. There's one or two that I think are legit. Um, and we'll get there before we're done that I don't know what to do with. But what's wild to me is those, those are never the ones that, that people on the other side of the aisle bring up to me. They never bring up the hard ones. They bring up. So literally, okay. So I, I searched biblical contradictions. Okay. Yeah. I went to the, the first option on Google is the American atheist website, atheist.org slash activism slash resources slash biblical dash contradictions. This was Google's first offering to me. Let's look at several. It says, let's look at several contradictions. Exodus 20 verse eight says, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Romans 14, five says, one man esteem's one day above another. Another esteem's every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. That is the number one contradiction, biblical alleged biblical contradiction listed on the number one Google page of the American atheist website. That is in no way a contradiction. That is the apostle Paul engaging with the question of different people from different religious backgrounds and how they esteem different days. And many of the people who he's talking to are Greek, not Jew, and would not have honored the Sabbath their whole life. And he's saying that doesn't need to be a deal breaker. That's the purpose of Romans 14. And yet again, I go, Oh, this is going to be fascinating. I can't wait to see what great biblical contradictions they come up with. And that's the first one on their highest page. And I'm like, that's a joke. That's a, that is not, or Ecclesiastes one, here's the number one, second one, Ecclesiastes one, four, the earth abideth forever. But second Peter three, 10 says the elements shall melt with fervent heat. The earth also and the works that are there in shall be burned up. So let's talk context for a second. Ecclesiastes is not a statement of truth. It is not a book that is filled with statements of nothing but raw truth. It is a statement of the perspective of a man who's running an experiment on his own life. There's truth there, but you can't just take a five word phrase out of the middle of Ecclesiastes and claim that it is the, it is somehow God or God's word claiming that this five word phrase is truth. It's a, it's a wild concept. But on top of that, second Peter three, 10 is not claiming that there will not be an earth. There will be an earth. It won't be the exact same earth because the earth is going to be cleansed, which is the point that Peter is making in second Peter is that the earth will be cleansed. So not only are these not contradictory from their own perspective, not only does this completely misunderstand the context, but these two passages actually support one another. Again, that's the second one listed. And, and I just, this is, this is when I kind of, you know, start losing my patience. I don't know where to find an actual competent list of contradictions. Um, so I've got a book that I'm going to be looking at that allegedly is go for it. I've been talking too much. Well, I was just saying some of it too, I think, and we've talked about this before, but some of it is just, I think goes back to a question of like, I don't even know some people, um, yes, it's like a misunderstanding or like you're saying they, they haven't dug in to understand how they're integrated. But then I think some of it is just a question of is scripture trustworthy, which we have talked about, but I think, I think some of these lists, yeah, sometimes I've found several that they take things very seriously that are like, like you're saying, it's like, wait, why is this a hangup? But I think some of it is just like, okay, overall, we're proving that scripture is not trustworthy. So it's not even that each individual one is momentous in their mind, but it's that all of them together prove that scripture isn't trustworthy. And so I think that's, that's why for a lot of people, and it depends on how you, how you think. But I think for some people, it's helpful to dig into those small ones and, um, or at least enough of them, like you're saying where it's like, okay, I feel much better about this already, or in your case, disappointed, disappointed. But, um, but like, I, I think it's important to dig into a few of those just if you're new to studying this, because I think it can have that effect. So even if cumulatively they're not, they're not that many that are important for, um, faith conversations. It's the conversation of like, wait, if there's this many as scripture trustworthy, you know what I'm saying? Right. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So I think sometimes it's helpful for people to start there, even if you know, you can just take a couple, not that we have to do it now, but I'm saying for people, if this is the first time that you've been engaging with this, sometimes that's the question that people are asking is like, wait, is scripture trustworthy? And then dig into the meat of them. I don't know. Or something, or something could feel like, feel really contradictory. Like I know you were saying earlier, but for somebody who really, who is like, okay, I really believe that the earth was formed over millennia. Right. And somebody who's like, no, I really believe that what it was seven days of creation. And that's kind of what got our, our earth to where we are today. Right. Those, I feel like the perspective of the interpretation of scripture can feel contradictory. Is that, is that an accurate thing to say? Or am I saying that weird? No, I think there's something very much so. I'm just saying like for somebody who doesn't understand if they're just, if they just make an assumption like, yes. Oh, well, the, if you're a Christian, then you can't believe in science. It's like, right. That's not a biblical thing. That's right. That's a personal thing. Right. Which I feel like that would feel contradictory. Yeah, absolutely. And so it's like, I don't, I don't know where that falls in the contradiction conversation, you know? It does not. So it does not belong in the biblical contradiction conversation. Yes. What that belongs in is in the general trustworthiness of scripture conversation. What does scripture claim to be? Which we've talked about. I know we have. And so whether, and even Herman Utich's conversation is how do we interpret Genesis one or Genesis two or Genesis three and what are they, how do we interpret them and what is being said there? It feels like a contradiction because our scientific understanding, our empirical evidence seems to reveal one thing and the scripture seems to reveal something different. Now, the law of non-contradiction would tell us we have to be wrong with at least one of them. Maybe both. It isn't that science has to be the science, the empirical evidence. Sorry, there's no such thing as the science. That's such a, anyway, the empirical evidence science has no authoritative power. It's a science. Yeah, the science. But any more than the Bible, by the way, don't do that. Don't, don't fall into both. Well, the Bible says like, okay, it might, it says, for example, what I just read, the earth shall last forever or whatever. That doesn't mean the Bible is making that claim. That's somehow God is making the claim, the earth abideth forever. Yeah. So, so again, be careful with either one of those. Don't quote the science or quote the Bible as though those are, everything that comes out of the Bible is not equal. Yeah. And so. But what you were saying, I feel like is helpful because as I'm hoping that we continue to have conversations with people who are really struggling, hopefully we can just help delineate for our listeners, like this truly, this question really is a contradiction. And so I feel like that's a good thing for us to keep in mind is like, is this a hermeneutics question? Is this an authority of scripture question? Or is this a biblical contradiction question? Yes. This is so, and so a biblical contradiction would need to be, would need to be, they are in the same way, in the same time, in the same place, a contradiction. Yes. And so probably the, you know, our best sources for potential contradictions when we work our way there should actually be the Gospels because it's four different authors writing about the same or similar experiences. And so that would be the best place where we would look for, are there contradictions, true contradictions between the way John explains something between the way Matthew explains something, because that, that's actually a pretty good, I mean, that'd be pretty tough. All four men from different backgrounds writing, two of them eyewitnesses, two of them not eyewitnesses. Yeah. And man, that should be riddled with contradictions. I mean, you get four people to watch the same video, the same 15 second video and then write a summary of it and you will, they will be riddled with contradictions. We ran a study when I was at A&M where they, where they, they showed people a video and then had a questionnaire afterwards. And one of the questions, they had a whole, the questions are identical except for one question, which one was, did the windshields break when the cars collided? And the other test said, did the windshield break when the cars smashed into each other? And the best predictor of whether or not someone thought the windshields broke was not whether they saw video with windshields breaking, it was whether the word smashed was used. Funny. And so for human beings, if you hear, if someone asks you, did the cars, did the windshields break when the cars smashed into each other? Apparently the answer is yes. But if it's collide, apparently the answer is no. So that shows how terrible we are as eyewitnesses. And so. Eyewitnesses of the same frame and the same, like from the same perspective. Yeah. Exact same angle, exact same perspective, exact same few seconds. Yeah. And then we have, we have four men, two of which are eyewitnesses, two are second hand, testimony gatherers, and they are describing some of the same events. The events should be so radically different. I mean, they should be, have nothing in common. And yet they are shockingly similar. However, how do we, if we find any contradictions, that would be at least interesting, wouldn't it? So you guys, you guys are going to love this. I literally was scanning down through these other top again. Let me emphasize the top choice, the top Google search website with the top examples and item one, two, three, four is human sacrifice. And it is from Leviticus. Do not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither thou shalt profane the name of God, which technically is about Molech worship, not about human sacrifice. But I will also, I will acknowledge if the person knew scripture better, they would know that human sacrifice is forbidden scripturally. And I kid you not, the contradiction is the story of Jephthah making an oath to God and then sacrifice, potentially sacrificing his daughter when he comes home for victory. Yeah. Which God in no way instructs Jephthah to do. Yeah. It is all his, that is all Jephthah's ideas. And we don't even know that he actually did it. But if he did kill his own child, he doesn't know that he did it, meaning like physically killed her. We don't know if he actually literally killed her or not, because the Bible doesn't actually say that. He promises that he will. It seems like probably he does. My opinion is that he actually probably does, though he may not. We don't know. It's not like God was pleased with that. That is the prescriptive versus descriptive example that we gave a minute ago. And so I love, because sometimes I will even say the prescriptive versus descriptive and people are like, oh, no one actually throws those out there. Well, yeah, the American Atheist website item four on their contradictions page is a raging example of that. Now, they put a little note says, remember, God is omniscient and knows the future. He should have stopped this. Well, that's your judgment call. That is not a biblical contradiction. We can debate that whether you think God has their authority or has the responsibility to stop moral evil in the world. That's a debate we can have. But this is not like this is a great example of that is an a total error of the prescription versus descriptive type. So just to catch us up to speed for my own sake. Or to summarize, so when you start from the beginning, when it comes to contradictions, first you ask, is it actually there? Is it actually in the Bible or is it one of those things that because we have talked about before, there are a lot of things that we quote that are not actually in Scripture. Looking at you, God helps those who help themselves themselves. So see if it's actually in Scripture, then from there, see if it is something like that where it's descriptive, not prescriptive. And then from there, see if there is a way that the biblical concepts integrate if when you understand the bigger picture, is that what you had said? And then from there, if it still seems to be a contradiction, then go from there and do more digging. And here's another one that we will run into a few times, is remember what's actually happening in these passages. So let's take for example, discussing with a group last night questions and stuff. A question came up about a perceived difference between two of the gospel accounts, one being in Mark and one being in John, if I remember correctly. And we talked about it, but we talked about the fact that John had a copy of Mark. Like John quotes Mark, he quotes Matthew, he quotes Luke. And so what we have is an example of John did not feel like it was necessary to throw out Mark because he and the author Mark may have had a different perspective on a certain event. So he didn't go like, oh, well, Mark claims this happened. That's not right. I need to throw out the book of Mark. This is not a true gospel. Even if they had a different perspective on the same event, instead, he writes his experience of that event, which may or may not contradict Mark. We can talk about that at some point. But notice, he still cites Mark about other things. So he considers Mark a trustworthy witness for many things. He just has a different memory of this specific event that may or may not be actually contradictory. That it may be that both of them could happen. Some people think they could. Some people think they couldn't. But this was huge to me, the recognition that these... So we've done it in Samuel, where we have Saul wipe out the Amorites, the Ammonites. He just wipes them out. Like he claims every man, woman and child. He's killed everybody but the king, and then they killed the king right then. The problem is, like four chapters later, you have Ammonites running around. Well, the same guy wrote this book. He didn't think of that as a contradiction. So he must have understood the idea of slaughtering all the Ammonites as not literally meaning slaughtering all the Ammonites. I slaughtered them all in this zip code. Well, that's probably what it means, is in this battle, the ones who fought me, I killed. Everyone who ran or hid or whatever, like, no, I didn't hunt them down. I don't mean literally every single man. Again, that's war language. And so that to me is an example. You have to look internally. It's not probably appropriate for us to consider it a contradiction if the original author did not consider it a contradiction. Because what that would indicate is kind of like I said about the Cowboys killing the Giants. So if I say the Cowboys absolutely slaughtered the Giants, I mean, they just killed all of them. And then and then I'm like, and next week the Giants are going to be playing the Rams. You'd be like, wait, I thought the Giants were all dead. Well, contextually, we understand it perfectly well. And they would have understood contextually perfectly well that language then too. We didn't just invent this. So anyway. So would you say a good next step for people when it comes to digging into these is maybe like just starting with like reading the whole chapter that it's found in or something simple like that, where it's yeah, definitely do digging and we can give more suggestions on how to to research. But I think that seems like a practical next step of like just read the portion of scripture that it's found in. You know, and then that may be a good way of realizing like what you're saying of, oh, this isn't even viewed as a contradiction, you know, by the author or whatever. Sorry, I'm just I'm still scanning down through these alleged. They only offer on this main page. They only offer like 12 and they're just all terrible. Like they need to hire me to write their contradictions page. I could do a better job. Are there any that you're seeing that are like a bad example of contradictions for another reason than the ones we've just talked about? I mean, the context what is the same time and in the same way we have Genesis 32 30 I have seen God face to face in my life is preserved. And then no John one 18 no man has seen God at any time. Yeah, I've seen that one. And and you're like, okay, they are clearly not described one. John had certainly read Genesis 32. And so John did not think of himself as contradicting Genesis 32. This is clearly talking about this the a different way of seeing God. And and what John is talking about is is the nature of the what it means to see God in this way in John one 18 is clearly not what's being described in Genesis 32. And again, you're right. If you went and read those chapters, you would realize, oh, these aren't this is like I'm batching it this weekend. Like this is using the concept of seeing God into very different ways. And so they don't contradict each other because they're not talking about the same thing. Though, and again, I just I love the idea of taking a passage, you know, 10 words out of Genesis and comparing them to seven words out of John as if as if that type of coalition is supposed to be something you can do throughout Scripture. But because of that, but it's I mean, here's a here's an obvious with God, all things are possible. Matthew 19 26 and then Judges 1 19. The Lord was with Judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. That's just again, that's just poor contextual understanding. It is not the Lord that can't drive out the inhabitants. It is Judah. That is the he's the the the he here is Judah, not God. So that's a wow. Impressive man. It's just it's impressive how bad these are. I hate to mind. I don't mean to mock and I know maybe it sounds like I'm mocking. I just I feel like I am being mocked by these being the best examples that they can throw out there. I have seen well, I mean, I have seen some though that are like we talked about. They are hard concepts even for Christian like their conceptual. So it's not just the verses, but it's like, hey, these two verses represent concepts that are hard for anyone to grasp, you know, like like this God prevent harm to good Christians is one. Yeah. And so it's like, you know, there are, you know, there are a lot of verses that are like talking about that. And so I think some of it. Yeah, I think some of it is I don't know that all of them are backed by a lot of research or hard work, but then there are some that seem to be talking more about like, these are problems that I have with Christianity in general. And here are two verses that demonstrate this concept. You know what I mean? Oh, listen, last week or last whenever it was last time we met when the last podcast, the one you threw out there, Brin, about the character of God being God who does not tempt someone. And then there seems this is this is a character's trait of God. It's a statement about God. God does not tempt people. And yet then we have examples that it looks a lot like that. I wish I could say I'm surprised. I'm not. That your example of a what is a perceived contradiction is much stronger than anything on the main American atheist website. Those are that's a that's a much more difficult one to unpack and is is a much more authentic potential contradiction. And which I really appreciate like, it's not I just you know what what I'm what I am tempted to mock is if these are the contradictions that drive you into treating the Bible as absurd, you need to do a lot more homework. Yeah, yeah, that doesn't mean there aren't some in there that are really hard. Like you said, I totally know that makes sense. But the ones that seem like to me, it's like, do you actually think Christianity is that shallow that those those particular arguments are the ones that dismantle it in your mind? Oh, gosh, yeah, how it's insulting to think like, I'm so dumb that this that these didn't chase me off. Right? Like, oh, if you had any intelligence at all, you would not accept the Bible because look at this. Ecclesiastes nine seven says, Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart. But first Corinthians 730 says they that rejoice as though they rejoice not. I'm not kidding that that's one of their examples on this. Yeah. And like, yeah, man, you're man got me. I don't have any way to engage with those two things. Like, you've got the whole Bible to choose from. And that's what you pick. You guys are you've probably not seen we may have even talked about this. You've not seen the movie Roxanne with Steve Martin. No, Bryn, you haven't either. It's a retelling of the Cyrano de Bergerac story. Oh, interesting. It's it's really well done. It's very funny. I don't think there's anything truly inappropriate in it. I think Daryl Hannah runs around without clothes on, but she's hidden the whole time. You can't see her. It's just supposed to be funny that. That Steve Martin doesn't think to bring her clothes under those situation under the situation, but it's it's a worthwhile movie. It's very funny, but he has that huge nose. The Cyrano de Bergerac has. Well, there's a scene where he's in a bar and this kind of thug guy is, you know, they they're talking back and forth and the thug guy goes, Oh, yeah, well, something something big nose. And Steve Martin turns around is like, Really? I give you this to work with. And the best you can come up with is big nose. Like I gave you all this. And so then there's this famous scene from the movie where where Steve Martin has to give 20 something's better 20 better insults for his own nose. And and they're they're just they're brilliant. They're actually ends up being like 34 of them. The movie intentionally miscounts because apparently they wanted to use all of them. But he he delivers these brilliant insults against his own nose. And honestly, that's how I feel when I read something like this. I'm like, you have the whole Bible to work with. And you're and you're taking a verse from the middle of Ecclesiastes and comparing it to a verse in 1 Corinthians 7 that honestly have absolutely nothing to do with each other. They don't contradict each other. They're in no way connected. And they're two totally different forms of literature. It's like, this this is it. Like this. This is the best you got, man. I could give you 20 better ones. Well, it seems like there are two. There are two, you know, groups of people who claim contradictions. One is people who are actually seeking and come against walls that that are truly causing them to question the authenticity of Scripture. And then another group that just has to be able to do that. And then another group that just uses anything that they've already decided that they're not going to follow Christianity. And so they use anything no matter how small or weak or they don't they haven't even it seems like they haven't even done a lot of research to see if the things that they're listing are accurate. But it's just like, oh, let's pile on more. See, Christianity is laughable. Right. And I found a quote on one of the websites that I was reading that said to be an atheist, one need only be able to laugh when such obvious nonsense is offered as being divine truth, divine truth in quotes. And it's, you know, it is a more of a mocking tone, but we know that not everyone who claims contradictions to the Bible have that. So it seems to be kind of two different groups of people. The unfortunate part is a lot of the. The group that is potentially just piling up whatever they can find against the faith that they have decided not to follow is affecting people who are actually searching because of the the sheer magnitude of the amount of things that are being quoted. You know, so it's like, oh, there's a thousand contradictions. And if you are actually someone who's searching for, oh, is the Bible trustworthy? And you don't even know where to start when it comes to a thousand because you know what I'm saying? It's like, oh, well, that's that's so overwhelming. Like, I don't even know if I can dig into all of those. But this website says that there are a thousand. Right. Do you remember? Do you remember there was a kid who I told you a kid. I mean, he was a college student who I told you all about in the podcast, maybe, maybe, I mean, way back that he actually said that he had walked away from his faith because of all the contradictions in the Bible. Yeah. And when I asked him about it and he said, well, you know, I learned about him at school that there's there's all these kinds of like, OK, which one was the tipping point? Like, which one was it that you thought, oh, wow, I cannot tolerate this anymore? Yeah. Yeah. And he's and he said, it's no, no, it's not that there wasn't any just one. It was just the fact that there's so many. Exactly. Yeah. And he couldn't remember a single one. And yet he had been told so often by by these different people in authority, oh, there's so many. And he had just come to trust that versus one, even if there are that does not necessarily make the case of Christ absurd. Right. Right. Second, if there are, I would argue there aren't many and and there aren't there. It may be that there are truly none in the originals, but even if there are like, I feel like there's plenty of ways to engage with them. There's authentically plausible ways to engage with them. Anyway, I just I just feel like there's a lot of there's some work to be done here, but I would encourage anybody. If back to what we said many times, if you discover something that troubles you with this, is you like, oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do with this contradiction. One good for you for doing the work. Yeah, totally. Check and make sure it's there. Check and make sure that it's not an obvious contextual difference that just anybody who spends two minutes looking at it can spot that it's an actual contradiction. It's not two different books talking about two different things with two thousand years between them with two totally different forms of literature. Like don't it's it's okay to do to do a little bit of work there. And then if you don't look it up or send it to us. And I mean, we're not God's gift to all of this stuff, but there I promise you it may be new to you. It may even be new to me, but it isn't new. Most of those who are Christians know more about the potential than those who aren't. Yeah, totally. And I think it's like you're saying, I think it's also okay once you've done your own searching, if you're still wrestling to send it to someone. I mean, I do that. That's why I ask Chris and Chris and other people of people who have a greater biblical understanding. Hey, I'm still coming into a problem with this. Can you help me understand because you have a greater knowledge of scripture or historical context or Greek or whatever it is. Find an expert who can help you walk through it. But I know we're about out of time, but maybe next episode we can dig. I know we didn't get to a lot of specifics of the true apparent. The contradictions that pose a more challenging. We're going to make people wait a little bit on that. But I do like that we laid a good foundation for if somebody's dealing with them right now, here are some good questions to ask. Here are things to look at and then how to kind of go about continuing that on that journey of looking rather than just like, okay, well, there's some contradictions. Oh, well, or apparent contradictions, I should say. Anyway, well, thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it. And if you have anything that's burning in your brain that you're like, man, I really want to hear what they have to say about this contradiction or apparent contradiction or something like that.
