We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Bren Starnes. And today we have a special guest in studio with us. And so I'm going to throw it over to Bren to do kind of our introduction. So Bren, take it away. Yeah, yeah. In studio, so fun. A lot of times we have to do calls, but yeah, I'm really excited. Our guest today is a longtime friend of mine, Catherine Covington. Do you go by Catherine or Missy still? Cause growing up, I definitely called you Missy. Yeah, no, everybody that met me post like 2009 calls me Catherine. Okay. So we'll just go with that. But I'm really excited. So Catherine and I grew up together, have been friends for a long time, but kind of lost touch for a number of years in adulthood and then have reconnected recently, which has been super fun. Yep. And she came back. Time to head up the cool people and bring up one of them. That's what she's telling me anyway. But Catherine grew up in the church and we took like worldview and apologetics classes together, probably public speaking. Were we in public speaking together? All the things. I mean, I took Chris Sherrod's apologetics class actually. Oh, okay. Did you know he and Chris like were the original, um, well, and Colson for the original partners and crime on the podcast. They started it. Yeah. Then we upgraded. Um, yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. No, they just were like, Oh no, we need somebody. Chris is gone. Exactly. Yeah. Catherine and I took worldview and apologetics together. And then I guess you took some glasses that I didn't. Um, and then in adulthood, I think you, do you consider yourself agnostic now? Is that where you, it's a, well, we'll get into it later. It'll be really interesting. But, um, yes, sort of, I guess that's the most simple explanation I can come to, but it feels oversimplified. Yeah. For sure. It doesn't it always. Um, but all that to say, I'm excited because for a number of reasons, one, Catherine is super fun and I love her as a friend, but she's also well read, very articulate, um, a great thinker. And we had just been talking and I was like, Hey, this is kind of crazy, but do you want to come on the podcast because you're going to have a different perspective than a lot of our guests. And we've talked before and even talked, I think in the last episode about how the value of talking to people that you don't necessarily agree on everything with, especially when it comes to religion and faith and that we want to keep learning and growing. And so we want to hear your story and we want our listeners to hear your story to see what we can learn and how we can grow. Um, and just demonstrate that like you don't have to agree on everything to have a cordial, good conversation. Yeah. I think if you're only surrounding yourself with people that agree with you on every point, like what's the point of an echo chamber, you know, just listen to yourself. I love talking to people that I disagree with. Like there were some of my favorite conversations. Yeah. So for all those reasons, I'm really excited about today and thanks for, for coming. It's going to be a great time. I'm so glad you guys invited me. Um, but if we want to start out, you can just tell your story, whatever part of that you want to tell. I'll try to keep it pretty short. Um, starting with like, no, don't, okay. I love how I've, I've been listening to a few of y'all's podcasts, like in preparation for this. And I love how short y'all's podcasts are. And I'm like, and then I'm going to get on there and it's gonna be like, well, this is a two hour episode. Oh no. We'll divide it into five episodes. I do love how short and visible there. Um, but starting with kind of a disclaimer, um, some of the, some of the things that I'm going to talk about, um, involving like decisions my parents made and how they raised me are kind of some hurtful, hard truths sometimes. So I'm sure that there's going to be some people that listen to this that, that know my family. And so, you know, if you're listening to this, maybe don't text my mom and be like, Hey, you should listen to this podcast with Catherine, you know, because, um, there's, there's nothing that I'm not trying to villainize anyone in my life. Um, I really, I have the privilege of being able to say that I have two parents that loved me and sacrificed a lot of their own financial gains and, and personal mental stability and all of these things to try and do what they thought was best for me. And I think that that's something that I, so many people in my life can't say, right? So there's going to be things that I'm going to discuss and say, Hey, I don't agree with this and I don't think this was the right choice and I don't think this was the right decision, but I'm not trying to villainize anybody and be like, Oh, they were wrong for this. Like they genuinely were doing what they thought was best. Um, despite the fact that it might've had long-term consequences, right? So, um, some of the truths are hurtful. So maybe if you're listening to this, don't be like, Charlie, listen to this. Um, but starting with that little disclaimer, but growing up, I, I, my family was a very active part of IBLP, um, which is now a bit notorious thanks to the shiny happy people that came out on Amazon. The Duggars are like kind of the photo perfect family. Um, like the poster, yeah, they're the poster children, poster children, the 20 children poster children for, for, um, IBLP or ATI was kind of the parent organization and that one didn't get talked about as much, but ATI was overarching parenting organization, which then fed into things like IBLP, alert, um, Excel, all of these offshoots of, um, ATI. So my family was very, very active in that. And if you're not familiar with IBLP, it is an extremely legalistic, extremely patriarchal, um, I don't even know the right words, I guess for it, but, um, dogmatically, um, legalistic, and, um, basically teaching curriculum. Um, they had their own homeschool curriculum. They had the answers and the solutions to absolutely everything. Right. And so, uh, my parents did not grow up in a Christian household whatsoever. Um, and for my mother, it was a pretty traumatic household as well. Um, and so when she decided she was going to start having kids, she wanted better for her family than she had. Right. So, um, they started going to a church that was largely, um, ATI families, ATI, IBLP families. And so for the first time, my, my mom saw this structure of, oh my goodness, the, the father's active and the father makes all the decisions and he's in control and in authority and the mother's nurturing and kind and loving and all of these things. And then the kids are perfect, you know, cause that's always the image. And it was the first time I think she ever saw that family dynamic in real time of, oh, this is, this is what I would want my life to maybe look like. And so, um, they just dove headfirst into it, you know, trying to avoid their lifestyle and their childhood. Um, and, and we were a part of that probably until I was pretty actively until I was about 14, 15. Um, we lived really close to what I call the compound. Um, but it was, it was the campus where they did all of their conferences and, um, retreats and all the things. And so we would work out there as a family. My dad's a physician and he always volunteered for like medical help. And so we were a very, very active part of that for a lot of years. Um, their curriculum is called the wisdom books. Um, and we went through all of them every, every year. It was like a yearly thing. We would do all 52, um, wisdom books. And, um, thankfully my parents, yeah, it's the same ones and you had redo them because there's always something new to gain from it. Uh, just like the Bible. Um, and oh gosh. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That language is just like the Bible. There's always something new to gain from it. Um, and thankfully my parents really value education. And so I know a big complaint from other ATI or IBLP members is that they didn't receive a good homeschool education. My parents supplemented the wisdom book with, you know, calculus and physics because a lot of families just did the wisdom books and not education. And that's kind of how they were marketed. They were marketed as an end all be all. This is all you need, you know? And, um, yeah, even like over the Bible in some ways, right? I mean, it's kind of like their version. It was like, this is the interpretation. Obviously you need to read your Bible and obviously you need to do your own studies, but this is the conclusion that you should be coming to regardless, you know? Right. Um, and a caveat here too. My, I was talking with my brothers in like preparation and be like, Hey, you know, how, why do you, what, what do you remember about this? And so they're, everybody had their each individual experience, right? I'm, I'm the only girl in my family. Um, I'm the youngest of four and I have three older brothers and they all have a slightly different experience. So this is mine. Um, if it's something pretty aggressively different, I'll probably like bring in their perspective. But yeah, we were, we were part of it till I was about 14. And then, um, this is one of the places where we diverge, um, in beliefs. But one of my brothers says he remembered they would do a yearly conference every year. It was huge. Thousands and thousands of people. And, um, one of my brothers remembers that conference being our last one and Bill Gothard, who was the, the leader of IBLP. Um, I didn't make that connection. Yeah. I grew up with some Bill Gothard stuff too. I didn't know that. Didn't you? Well, no. I mean, we had a lot of friends that were in it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Brent and I had a, had a big overlap, but thankfully her family wasn't in on the cult. Um, but yeah, I was around it. So that one was a big, that conference was really focusing on trusting and faith in God. And, uh, Bill Gothard at one point, I remember him saying something about basically if you have enough faith and you have enough trust in God, there's no reason to ever seek medical, um, and I mean, all solutions for anything ever. Um, because if it's the will of God, you'll be healed regardless of chemotherapy or regardless of any sort of medical treatment. And, and my mom's a nurse and my dad's a doctor. And, um, so one of my siblings remembers that being like the hard point of like, no, we're done. Right. Um, me and then the rest of my siblings don't remember that like hard cut off, but it kind of ended up being, we started spending more time with, we started getting a really good community and Tyler really around from about 10 to 14 of my age, 10 to 14 of other families who are still Christian, who are still homeschooled, who still had a lot of our similar values, but it wasn't as stringent. You know, it wasn't strangling. These are the things you have to believe. Or, you know, if you wear pants, you're a center or, you know, as a woman, obviously, obviously the men can do whatever they want. Um, it's a joke, but is it? But do you think that's interesting insight? So it's like, so you're right. So when I say grace, aggressively patriarchal, I mean, I grew up for the first most of my life. I, I did not think that I was going to go to college because there was no need for me to have a college degree because I was going to be a homemaker. That was, that was, that was going to be my job. Now I have a degree in engineering and work in a male dominated field. So I clearly moved pretty, pretty strongly away from that, but I didn't think I was going to college. I didn't think that I would move out of my parents' home until I found a husband. I thought that I was going to be, you know, from one covering to another, correct? The, you guys have all seen the notorious umbrellas of protection authority, right? And, and we, that was taken extremely seriously in the home, which was really interesting because, um, my father is a very passive person. He is not authoritarian at all. He is not the power hungry anything. Right. And so, no, no, no, no. And I can see one of, I remember one of the comments that was in shiny, happy people is that it made every man, the God of their own home. And that truly is the structure that was set up for that. Thankfully, my dad didn't take advantage of that. He's just a very sweet, kind, passive person. Um, but my mom tried to enforce that through him. So, you know, like she, she was a big, my mother is an authoritarian person. She's a very strong personality. Um, and so I think that that really called to her because it was like, Hey, you don't have to make all the decisions. You don't have to lead everything. Right. You know, you are now, you can take a step back and you can rely on somebody else and it's somebody else's decisions and somebody else's responsibility instead of your own. And I think that really, really called to her. And so she tried to enforce that through him. Um, but yeah, umbrellas of protection, you know, from, from one, uh, from dad to husband was supposed to be my, Oh yeah. Cause you were saying you're the only girl. Yeah. I'm the only girl. And so it was really interesting growing up with that. Um, again, it comes down to hurtful truths. Um, you know, growing up, it really felt like, Oh, I, I am not the priority. I am. I am being raised for someone else. You know, it was, you need to be this. So you'll be a good wife and you need to do this. So you'll be a good mother. And I was like, okay, I'm raised for this thing. And then it was always so focused on, you know, men and leadership skills for men. And you need, you know, they need to be leaders in their home and leaders in the society and in their community and in their job. And I always had a very strong personality for lack of a better term. And I always was a take charge kind of person, you know? And so being told literally daily, you're wrong for that. You are wrong for being the way that you are. And that is sin for you to be this strong personality for you to try and step over a man in any sort of leadership role or any sort of teaching role or anything, you know? You just need to be less constantly every single day. My parents had a, a book that was literally called raising a strong willed child that sat on my mom's nightstand for the entirety of my life. And it was, it was genuinely about, and I don't mean this in, in a mean way, but it was genuinely about breaking the will of a strong willed child. And so, and I think a lot of people hear something like that and they're like, Oh, they want to villainize it immediately. Like, Oh, how dare, how could you want to break your child? But at the same time, if you look at the, the facts that they were given of like, Oh, we have a sinful nature and for Catherine to be holy, for Catherine to be the best Christian she can be, this is what we need to do. And this is the fight we're going to fight. And man, did we fight. But like, it was way harder for them to enforce that, that level of discipline and that level of, I mean, I guess this one's pretty much the best word for that daily than it would have been to just let me be strong willed. Right. So they did it because they thought they were making me into something that God wanted me to be. Right. So it's, it was, it truly wasn't like a power trip. It wasn't like, Oh, well we have to be in charge of, you know, your, every thought, your, every action. It was, we want you to be in compliance with God and we are the, the, um, the people that basically decide what that is for you. And, and this is what we're taught and this is what we believe. So we're going to enforce that. So yeah, it was, it was tough growing up. So can I interrupt you real quick? Please, please interrupt with any questions. So, um, so you were saying y'all were really involved until you were 14. Did that, you know, after that changed, your community changed a little bit. Did it, did you feel like that, like it shifted a bunch as far as like how, how, how your parents' relationship and years changed? So the way that IBLP is set up, it is, is worldwide. It is not like a local thing, right? They, they had training institutes and they were called training institutes in case you wondered how culty it sounded. Um, in Russia, in Peru, they were all over. So I don't think I realized that at least growing up, I had no idea that was that. China, Russia, um, Jason, my oldest brother spent a year and a half in Russia working, um, in that training institute, um, at like 16, I think he was really young. Um, but so it was, it was, you would come together and whether it be family camp or, um, the, the IBLP conferences or, um, smaller groups, I guess. Um, but it wasn't a gathering like a, like a church, right? So the people that we associated with in ATI, we didn't see super often. It wasn't like, Hey, this is our, our, our daily community. Right. Um, it was when we lived at Lubbock is the, where we first lived. And that was the church that almost every one was a member of ATI. And that's what got my parents into it. But then when we moved to Tyler, um, we started kind of branching out a little bit. We started making more friends that were just good homeschooled Christian people. Um, you know, my parents got involved in Tachi and, um, Tyler area Christian home educators for those. Yes. Thank you, Brandon for that acronym. Cause I was not aware. Um, it's just like the name of it. Wasn't your dad like president of it for a while? Yeah. Twice, I think. Um, but we started getting involved in other, and I think with other communities of people, and we have a really great core group of friends, um, from that still to this day. Uh, but I think being around those people, it started softening my parents in a way. So it wasn't like a hard we're done. We're moving on from this. It was kind of a slow chipping away and softening of, Hey, you know, the goods wear pants and you know, um, and so I don't know if it was a combination on that Hill and that Hill. And that was every single Hill was I joke. I remember I like joke and laugh with my dad a lot about, Hey, do you remember 11 through 14? And he will just like roll his eyes because I think there was a screaming match, like an absolute all out battle of wills. I think every day about 11 through 14 as a child, um, with my mom, but it, uh, I think I had that too, but I don't think it was the same. It was just, it was, it was every inch of, you know, every inch of ground just felt like Gettysburg. It was a blood bath and there was no, there was no simple, I chose every Hill to die on and so did my mom, you know, um, which is kind of what I mean in like she was taught to do that. She was taught to do that. Correct. There was no, there was no grace. You know, there was no, Hey, you know, maybe we don't need to fight this one. That wasn't, it was life or death. So, but it, and it was like this carrot hanging of like, because if you do, then it'll produce whatever. Correct. Correct. And it was very much marketed to my parents. I don't know if these are exact words, but very much marketed to, Hey, if you do these things, your kids are going to turn out perfect. You know, so long as you follow these principles or this curriculum or this program, it's going to be okay. And, and I remember my mom did tell me one time, she's like, we really thought, like absolutely thought that we could parent the evil out of our children. Right. You know, like we thought that if we just did all the right things and we picked every fight and we didn't let anything go and we didn't let anything fall by the wayside and we made all the right decisions that you guys would be right. You know, and that's not biblical at all. Like parent the sin out of them. Yeah. We could just parent the sin out of our kids and shocker. It didn't work. So, so, I mean, let's, so fast forward to, you know, you graduate from high school. What, what is, what does that look like? So by, by the time we hit 14, I mean, things had loosened up, like I said, from being around all these other people that believed differently and we're still good people and we still thought we're probably going to go to heaven. So things kind of slowly laxed off as far as like I could wear pants. I could leave the home without another member of my family to watch me. But probably around 15 or 16 is when I was like, Hey, I really want to go to college. Like I want to go to school. And at first I was like, I really enjoy math. I enjoy science. And so at first I mean, even going into college, I chose to a teaching major because that was still, you know, one of the more acceptable, one of the more nurturing parenting type, no shame to any teachers. I didn't do it cause I hated it, but, but like from where you're coming from, it's like, well, that's, it was still, it was still like an entry point. Right. Like I'm still going to parent and homeschool my kids. So why not have a teaching degree? And this is kind of a placeholder, right? So I went to college and I, I really wanted to go to college out of state. I wanted to go to Colorado state university. And my parents were like, no, we really don't want you to move out of the house. We don't want you to be so far away from any sort of protection or authority and all of that. So, I mean, I was 17 when I graduated high school. So instead of going to college, I sent me to Peru because that was not too far away for me. But I, Peru, Texas, right? No, Peru, Peru, Peru. But I worked at a school there with, he used to be our pastor and then he started an orphanage and school for underprivileged children there, which are basically all children. And so I worked there for about six months. I lived and worked there. And then when I came back, I started going to college at UT Tyler so that I could live at home so I could still be kind of under that protection. And I was an education major with a math minor. And then I pretty quickly learned that I hate teaching and that is not, not the move for me. And so I actually changed my major from education to engineering my sophomore year. And I just didn't ask. I didn't, I was just like, well, this is what's happening and this is what I'm going to do. It wasn't like secretive about it. I was just like, Hey guys, I hate teaching. You know, UT has this really great program where you teach, you student teach from your very first semester. And not, not a lot, but like you're in the classroom from your very first semester, building lessons plans. And I was like, Hey, I experienced this and I hate it. And it's not for me and I'm really good at math. So, and I think partially one of the reasons why it was a little more acceptable. I'm Asian for those on the podcast. They can't see me. And so pursuing something like engineering made my dad really happy. So I think my mom let it go because of that. My dad's undergraduate was actually in engineering and then you went to medical school. Right. So he's like the perfect Asian, right? He was doctor and engineer. But yeah, so that was kind of a battle. I guess at that point that shows how much evolution had happened. Cause that was a battle. They did choose not to fight. And they're at this point, or they just thought I was past hope. And they're one or the other. Catherine's will hope was cause of this point. Wow. That's fat. That whole, I've never thought of it defined this way, but this idea that everything is the law, everything is a battle to be fought. Everything, like that's kind of the definition of the fair sayical way of engaging with anything. Absolutely. No, no rubbing together the two pieces of wheat in order to munch them in the field on a Sabbath. Like, no, that's a battle. That's a hill we're going to die on. And like, everything is a hill you're not on. When you wear it upon your head, you are literally wearing it upon your head. And there is no wearing the scriptures upon your head. I mean, right, between your eyes and upon your wrists. And yeah, that's a literal translation. And there is no, no fighting that, you know, that just would not even be possible though. I mean, aside of fact, there is no temple to sacrifice things that would make the entire Hebrew scriptures almost impossible to absolutely. That's, that is so that sounds exhausting for everybody. Oh, it was parents. My mother has white, white hair. It is silver white and has been for a while. I'm just kidding. She absolutely blokes it on me. That's intriguing. Yeah. So is and, and because, because it was such, like you said, the old Testament, you cannot translate literally like that. You know, you can't apply it. You can apply it correctly. You can translate it literally correct, but you can't apply it to your life because one, we're not Jewish and two, they're the old laws. You know, we don't have to sacrifice a sheep every, every month and or every year. And we're really glad about that. Where would you even find sheep? But because of that, that's what led to, Oh, look at the wisdom books and Oh, look at, you know, these, these teachings and they've already done the legwork. They've done the interpretation and this is correct. Right. They've done that for you. They've done that for you. Again. Yeah. That's really amazing. Yeah. And no wonder that's something that's something, there's always something to push against. There's always something to fight back against. Always. In both directions. There's never going to be a sense of peace or no, there was no peace. Yeah. There was no peace. There was no grace. There was no like, Oh, just rest in him. You know, that wasn't, I mean, that was said obviously because it's in scripture, but there was no practical application of that. You are always wrong. You were never doing enough. You are, and you need to be doing more. Which is like unintentionally presenting a gospel that it's not teaching. Like it's, it's antithetical to the gospel that it's teaching. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, um, the basketball. I don't know if you've heard, I don't know if this came up in one of the ones you listened to, but I remember years ago, hearing an example of a, like a basketball coach who tells his team, they've shoot and miss the first half. And so he tells them next person who shoots and misses sits out the rest of the game, the rest of the season. And so, you know, he's trying to, allegedly he's trying to motivate excellence, but all he does is motivate. No one will ever shoot. Yeah. It's like you can't get anyone to shoot as, and as if God, that would be God's perspective on us as humans is to go, listen, you mess up and you're just kind of out of here. I'm done with you. And like, well, then you did a bad job creating us. If you want us to be perfect, you might should have created a very different race of beings. Correct. And like, if you, I mean, the, the verse that was just used over and I be holy as I am holy, right. And so it was just like, well, God's calling us to this holiness. And if you're not living it, you're failing. Right. And it's like, and failure is inevitable. Of course it is. Like we're not perfect. We are, you know, naturally evil and, you know, humans are not basically good. So you're going to fail and you're going to feel like a failure at all times. And you need to keep being perfect. And yeah, so it's super healthy and hasn't affected my adulthood in any way. Okay. That was, I don't know if you know, I'm a counselor as well as a pastor. Okay. So we know some, yeah, exactly. I spent a lot of money on there. I'm sitting here thinking, like, how do you even enter into these conversations without the hyper vigilance of am I being brainwashed again? What is the, like, how do you even have those conversations? Oh my God. Like these, you have a lot of them and there's a lot oftentimes tears, you know, so if I start crying, you know, it's fine. It's nothing I haven't cried about before. It's okay. You and I both have to give ourselves a grace to cry. We're like, I can cry. I can cry. I can cry. It's the first few times I cried on staff. I was like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And everyone's like, why are you apologizing? It's okay to express emotions. Yeah. But it's, it's one of those really difficult things in an answer to one of the things you said, Colson, about, you know, what did that look like going into adulthood? I mean, over the last 10 years of my life, I'm 30 now. So over the last like 10 years, I have had this weird parallel of duality where I still believe and do not believe everything I was ever taught. Right. So I'm, you know, an agnostic question mark in that I don't believe in Christianity, but at the same time, I get outraged when I see false doctrine, right? When I see, when I see churches preaching and leading people astray and I get outraged, but it's like, okay, well, if you believe in false doctrine, that means you believe in correct doctor. Right. So, so do you believe in it or are you not? And it's, it's this weird parallel of just, yes, you know, at this, both, um, you know, I'm, I'm now married and my husband is amazing. Um, but it's this weird thing where he has never once asked me to be that, Oh, well you need to be at home and cooking and in charge and cleaning and, and you start popping out babies. That's, that's not our marriage at all. And never has been, he's never put that responsibility on me. But then if I see him get up and like, go grab the vacuum cleaner, cause he thinks the house is dirty. I immediately feel guilt. Like that is my initial, like, my initial response of like, Oh, I should be doing that. That's not his responsibility. I'm a bad wife because I didn't do X, Y, Z. I didn't make this home for him. And it's like, no, Catherine, like he doesn't have a job right now and you work 60 hours a week so he can vacuum, right? You know, and like, that's, that's okay. You know, he's an equal participant in this home, but like, and I, all of those things are in my head, right? I still know them like clinically, but my initial reaction, just like you said, it's brainwashing, right? And so I absolutely have been brainwashed. So that's still a parallel in my brain of you're not doing enough. You're not good enough because your husband cooked dinner. Why weren't you home in time to cook him dinner? And it's like, well, because he's been home all day and that's okay. Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, so it's, it's exhausting living with just this complete parallel at all times, you know, and, and to be like, Hey, no, I, I don't believe that we have a personal relationship with God, but at the same time, feeling betrayed by God, right? It's like, well, if you didn't have a personal relationship with him, then, you know, so it's, it's just this constant, it's almost the worst of both worlds. I think we talked about this just some good. Yeah, it's like, because I think we, Catherine, we talked about this before, but it's almost like you have like the guilt and shame associated with an unhealthy relationship to God, but like at the same time, none of the benefits of actually having a relationship. Yeah. Yeah. It's exhausting. Yeah, man. Yeah. Oh, I'm just, I'm just, I'm wrapping my brain around this that you're still stuck in an exhausting cycle. Yeah. It's still feels exhausting. I'm still picking every battle. Exactly. That's what I was like. There's a, there's an empty way of life handed down to you by your four or five years. Exactly. I'm just dead on the Hill. I've lost Hills to die. I'm just dead. Good. That sounds like that's a necessary step. So when did you feel like your beliefs started to change? Oh, great question. Um, shockingly, there was trauma involved. Um, so in college, I was, I still absolutely identified as a Christian. Um, and I went to church and still spent time with almost exclusively believers. And it was probably around 21, 22, somewhere in there that I started, you know, asking more questions and not 2021. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, my age, 21, 22. I thought that's a, that's good clarification. Um, no, you're fine that I started, you know, asking questions and being like, okay, well why is, why is this and, and I had a great education. And that's what's one of the things that's really difficult is because every question I can come up with, you know, I hear Chris Sherrod's apologetics class, I hear the answer or worldview course that was a five year long course. I was trying to remember if we did all five years together. I think we did. No, because you graduated. All right. So you did the first like three. Yeah. And then, um, I did the last year, but yeah, just you, I have all the textbook answers, but regardless of knowing the textbook answers, I don't, I don't see the evidence of it in my life. And then I think, I mean, if we're getting into the trauma warning, um, kind of the, the trigger of it all was I was engaged to. Sorry. You're good. Again, apologizing for crying. I was engaged to, uh, I haven't cried about this in so long. That's crazy. Um, a really incredible person who, uh, truly was the definition of seeking. Like he, he wanted to know all the answers. He sought out the truth. He asked all the questions. He would seek out people that were very educated and very respected in their fields for, you know, just wanting to know the truth and, and, um, just did not, did not find his answers. Um, and he ended up actually committing suicide. Wow. Sorry. You're good. Okay. Well, if you can't cry about that, you can't cry about anything. Right. Yeah. That's a heartbreak. Yeah. So he ended up committing suicide in 2017. And I think that obviously it was kind of the antithesis of, I mean, the, the peak of some of that bitterness for sure. And just kind of like the audacity of like, Hey, you said seek and you shall find, you know, knock on the door, she'll be open, but didn't find anything. Didn't know doors got open, you know, so, um, I apologize. I'm grateful that you're willing to be so vulnerable. Yeah. This is kind of, this is great for us, but also, I mean, I'm also just thinking like that your story is very impactful. And I mean, I'm not over here being like, I know there's nothing new under the sun, right? And I'm a big believer in that. So I'm not like, Oh, I have this problem that no one else has ever experienced. And there is no answer for it on the planet. Right. Um, I am not, my hubris is not so overinflated that I think that I'm the only person that's experienced this or the only person that, has questions that can't get answered. Right. Um, but yeah, seeing, seeing that and hearing a lot of people's people in the churches response to it because suicide is not a, it's not a pretty Zen, you know what I mean? Like, and people have terrible responses and answers. Yeah. Well, let's talk about that. I'd love to talk about that. Um, and it just kind of came down to, it's like, Hey, if this, you know, if this person who is genuinely wonderful and so kind and so selfless and earnest, I think is a good word, just very earnest in, in wanting the truth and wanting answers. Um, they couldn't get it. It's like, I'm not really interested in serving anyone or anything that doesn't accommodate that, I guess. Um, so that was probably a pretty serious breaking point. It was definitely leading up to that, um, for sure. Uh, I've been till then. Um, and then that was kind of a breaking point. And I just lost kind of all interest in, and there were, yes, there were some people that said horrible things. Um, but there were also wonderful people. I had a great support system, um, from his family, from other people in the church, from, from friends, like truly wonderful support system. So I'm not saying like, Oh, the church wasn't there and nobody was there to help or whatever, but, um, it was, I, I had a really good friend. It was Sherry Craig, actually, that, uh, pretty soon after it happened, she came into work to talk to me one day and she was like, she had just gone through a divorce and she, thank you so much. And, uh, she was like, Hey, congratulations. We've got the, we've got the ugly things that the church doesn't like to talk about. She's like, you know, people don't want to talk about divorce and people don't want to talk about suicide. And you know, it's the ugly stuff that they just want to write off as wrong and evil and a matter of circumstance. And he's here not to talk about. Yes, correct. Correct. It's, it's way easier if you have cancer, you know, like, Oh yeah, let's pray to be healed and, um, let's, you know, pray for healing. And then if it doesn't happen, it's God's will, you know, that's that was gross for simplification. I'm not saying cancer is easy. Yeah, but you hear what you're saying. Totally. Yeah. It's easier to talk about it, right? Grieve it or even celebrate the life of someone who dies because of cancer versus not many places can celebrate the life of someone who dies because of suicide. Yeah. It's, um, yeah, it's, it's an ugly, it's an ugly situation. And so, she was just like, yeah. And so we're just going to be in it together. And, and Sherry was so wonderful for that. And we, um, she'd always come by and check on me and yeah, just, just a great person, but yeah, it's, it's an ugly one and people don't like to talk about it and people don't like to get down to the source of it or any of that, you know, it's just often just written off as evil all around. Right. And, uh, selfish, selfish. Yeah. That's the shorthand. Yeah. It's always, we actually have two, if you're interested, we have two, I preached on it twice here, suicide. Okay. Um, and it's an intriguing, it's a, maybe a longer conversation we can do at some point, but, um, you know, we have like five suicides in the Bible. Most people only can reference Judas, but we have Samson. We have, um, there's a guy, I know a prophet who most people don't know who he is, but he commits suicide because God won't refuse us to fulfill his prophecy essentially. Yeah. No, no, no. Okay. And then Saul, uh, King Saul who falls on his own sword. Yes. And now I'm forgetting the fifth one. Anyway. And then there's also the suicide attempt by a Roman guard that Paul and, and, uh, and what's wild is those are not, the suicide itself is not, are not presented as sin. Right. Um, and so it may be, it may not be, but I think, um, one of the things we talked about is, you know, people commit suicide when they feel like there's only two options ahead of them, a long, slow, painful death or a quick death, relatively quick one. Yeah. And that's why depression is so dangerous is because depression creates the illusion of long, slow, painful, even when that's even, there's not just two choices, right? But none of us think it's sin when a Marine jumps on a grenade to save his friends, but that's suicide. Yeah. None of us think of it as sin. I assume no one thought maybe some people, I'm sure some, there's some people believe everything. There's somebody that believes everything. I am sure that there's a chalk talk somewhere about what's his name that says it's sin. But the, uh, um, who do we just say? I never can remember his name. What did we just say? Bill Godford. Bill Godford. Thank you. Yeah. Well, Bill Godford also got charged with the sexual assault of minors for like on 14 different counts, I think. So, uh, yeah. Paint me hugely surprised. Sorry. Yeah. Something about Pharisees that, uh, power hungry people that, uh, write books that basically make them next to God. Yes. They write things that are like the Bible. There's going to be a use of that power? No way. That's not human. That's not Christian theology. Oh, wait. Yes, it is. Oh, it is. Um, but so, so when people jumped out of the world trade center, when it's, you were going to burn alive, you're going to fall to your death. Those are your own, literally your only two choices. Yeah. We don't go like, Oh, they're so selfish. No. And so the truth is, and people don't know these, that this is how this plays out. And so I, I will tell you, I think God does accommodate for those things. I think His judgment does accommodate for those things. I don't see how it couldn't how if, if it doesn't, there's a version of justice we know nothing about, right? Yeah. And so the version of justice that God gives us that to whom much is given, much is required and people who claim things are then responsible for them. Right. I mean, if you, if I work with depressed people all the time and even suicidal people all the time, and I, I think it's a huge mistake to paint in large swaths when you're talking about stuff like that. And for sure. And for you to have to face that with, again, I know we're not throwing anybody under the bus, although honestly, that church, I'm, I don't feel that bad about it, but the, you can throw the church on the bus. That's fine. Okay. With the tools you had been given to, how do I interpret the God I've been told about as shared. And I talked about early on, I don't know when it was, it were like, yeah, I'm probably an atheist about your God too. I have met that God too. And I do not believe or, or, or sadly do believe. And then think he's not the God. Correct. But yeah, that's a, I don't, I mean, yeah, that's, that's one of the things. And it's just heartbreaking for anyone listening that is dealing with this or has dealt with it. One of the things that gave me a lot of comfort at the time was the woman was two pennies, right? Yes. And so looking at it, and I actually yelled at a pastor about this, because it was still picking fights at this time. Because he came by and was like, Hey, these are the things that we want to say, you know, at his funeral and all of the things I was like, okay, you're not speaking at the funeral. You don't get to open your mouth. And if we need to have the funeral somewhere else, that's fine. But you're not speaking because yeah. And I was like, because of course he talked about the evils of suicide. And I was like, okay, you're not allowed. You don't get to talk anymore. You're done. But one of the things that really spoke to me in that point was the woman was two pennies, right? Where Jesus said that she has given the most, despite the fact that she gave almost nothing. She gave almost nothing, right? That's like, Hey, you know, sure. It was 23 years. But at the end of the day, it was everything. And so that was one of the things that I really held on to. It was like, yeah, he gave us everything. You know, I'm sorry, his everything wasn't 85 years. And you know, a wife and kids and a career and whatever, but it was everything. And so yeah, it was two pennies. That's really a beautiful one to think of. Yeah. So that was one of the things that gave me a lot of comfort at that time. And it comes down to, yeah, do I really believe that? I don't know. You know, I do. And I don't at the same time. So that's a that's a place to be. Yes. Yeah. That's that's awesome. Are there any particular? I'm curious. Are there any I mean, a God who would not have an accommodation for mental illness, right? Obviously. I mean, yeah, there are plenty of people who don't. But that would be people. I could see that being if you if you were able to go like, oh yeah, God doesn't have an accommodation for mental illness, that I would be that would be deeply problematic for me too. You can imagine. Is there are there any other ones that you're like, and the hyper vigilance, the I'm being brainwashed, I can imagine that you've got shields and armor going full shields all the time. You know, Scotty, so it's like, don't let those things get through. That all makes sense. Are there any other that are like, it's a rub that you're like, I just can't do this. I think one of the things that just got drilled into us so much was there are three things that are undeniable and always true about God. And it's that he's all good and he's all powerful and that he all good, all powerful and all knowing. Sorry, it took me a second. I was like, wait, what are the three things I've watched it out? No, I'll go to all powerful and all knowing. Right. And those and all sorts of other things can be true at any point. But that's those are the three things that are eternally true. Right. And then just looking at the world around me, I'm like, I don't know if I can believe that. Like I can believe any two of them. I get any two of them. I'm on board, but I can't see all three and see the world that has been constructed around us. And I know that the world is cursed and I know that, you know, humans brought sin into it. But he also says in Revelations, he's going to have a new heaven and new earth. And then in first Peter, he talks about it being incorruptible. You know, it's an inheritance. It's incorruptible. And it's like, well, if you're capable of starting with an incorruptible, if you were capable of making an incorruptible new heaven and new earth, why don't we start with that one? You know, why, why make us run this rat race of misery? Sorry for the depressing turn. No, no, no, no. Good questions for what, for what? Is it your ego? Is it your, um, seeing it really like it makes you understand like, man, I see why these ancient cultures believed in, in gods that were so human like, right? No, I need you to worship me for my ego and I am petty and you know, you look at the Norse gods and all the Greek gods and all the Roman gods, they're petty and they're jealous and they're, they're just humans with more power, humans with more power, which is worse. It's worse, but it also makes more sense. I feel like when you, when you look at the world, you're like, yeah, I mean, if there was somebody that was all powerful and all knowing and, and perfectly good, why does, why does this stuff exist? You know, is it usually like the all good or is it one of the three rotates depending on the situation? Right. So like, if you, in my brain, you know, if you look at any two of them, they make sense, right? If you know, if you're all knowing, you know, everything's going to happen and you're all good and you have the best intentions, but you're not all powerful. You can't do anything about it. Okay. Or you're all powerful and you're all knowing, but you're not good. You know, you can be the puppet master or you're all powerful and you're all good. You make every decision with the best of intentions and you can change everything, but you don't know everything that's going to happen. You know, you're making these decisions game time and we'll see how it plays out. All any two of them make sense, you know, any, and you just add that third one in there and you're like, well, I can't, and it comes down, I understand. It comes down to like the classic, is he powerful enough to make a Rocky can't lift, right? What kind of engineering are you in? Mechanical. Mechanical. Okay. Yeah. And so, you know, if you're capable of making this incorruptible heaven and earth that you speak of, you know, how does that, how does that reflect free will? I don't know. How does that, I don't know. Yeah. I'm not going to pretend like I'm, you know, those are totally appropriate, totally fair. Yeah. Those are great questions. And growing up with, uh, educators, that's the, um, I think, I think I've said before, like my, my, the only way I can engage with all three of those as well is to assume. Like I was thinking, like I was thinking if I came to you with an engineering problem that I would expect you to understand it in ways that I don't, unlike, whatever. I don't know what you're talking about. I would trust you on that one. I stink of math. I'll tell you what I'll hire you. You do it and we'll build it. And right. And so I, and that's kind of what lends me to like, am I agnostic? I don't know exactly how that works. It's like, I don't think I know everything, right? And I don't think that like, oh, this is this argument that is the end all be all and Christianity is going to crumble underneath this thing that I thought of in 2023 that no one else has ever thought of. Right. Um, but at the same time, I haven't found an answer that satisfies me. Right. And I'm not saying that Christianity is not it, you know, I, I'm a, I think that Christianity is, is incredible when, when taught properly. Yeah. Right. And the version you were doesn't answer any of these questions. Correct. And so that's one of the things that I really loved about listening to your podcast is, um, it's been healing in some ways for me to be like, Hey, even though stuff that was taught me, it was wrong. You're like, all right, we'll just write about some of those. I was right to find on that Hill. That's exactly right. I think the thing that my battle is validated. And it's like a vindication, which is, I don't know if that's the right side of me to feed, but it's been, it's been really, really nice to like see some things like that. And, um, I think that they're, yes. I mean, I've read the Bible. I don't even know how many times we used to have to read every year beginning to end. Um, sounds like in King James though. Oh, of course, which is so confusing. Of course. King James, that's the only right kind of Bible. What are you talking about? No, no, it isn't. That was all sarcasm. We have people in the audience though. That's a Hill. They would be considered tempted to die on. Yeah. Yeah. I think the only, that's what Paul and Silas used. Sorry. No, you're fine. I think, I think the thing that's just still sticks with me. I told Brent about this is when I was, I was listening to your is the Bible sexist podcast. Yeah. I was like, I'm gonna listen to this before I go on there. Yeah. And I think, I think it was Chris shared actually, cause he was on that one or at the beginning and he was talking about the word for helper and how it aside from Eve, it's exclusively used in reference to God and, and Bryn, I I'm a huge lover of precise words. And like that gives so much dignity, that word. I was like, yes, that's the perfect word. Yes. And I, I loved it so much. And like that gave me, you know, that vindication of like, Hey, this isn't some condescending, you know, which is very much how it was structured. In my group. Yeah. You're supposed to help you. You need to step back and you're, you're helping, you know, you're not taking the lead. You don't have value in and of yourself. Correct. You, you have value for what you can add to someone else. Um, specifically a man, preferably, um, you know, you have value because you honored your father, you have value because you respected your husband and you followed him and you obeyed him and you have value because you were raising other men to be leaders in the home and to be, you know, and it's just so toxic. So just that dignity of that word was just so healing in some ways. Like, yes, I was right. I should have thought about that one. Yeah. That's a great one. Yeah. Can I give you another one? Yes, please. Okay. You quoted be holy, be holy as I am holy. Correct. Which is from first Peter chapter one verse 14 through 17. So I'm going to read. Um, so I'm going to start in verse 14 as obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy. So you also be holy in all your conduct since it is written, you shall be holy for I am holy. And if you call on him as father who judges impartially, according to each one's deeds, conduct yourself with fear through the time of the exile, knowing that you are ransom from the feudal ways inherited from your forefathers. Now with perishable things such as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. Okay. Real quick. First, yeah, I know we're all running out of time here, but that's, it's not going to be two hours, but I'm going to wrap up on this because I had to, as a program that I was running, I memorized first Peter and this one stopped me like a, like I'd run into a brick wall. So it's really funny that you mentioned that all the young men in IBLP were required to memorize all of first Peter. Well, the good news about memorizing all of first Peter is you come to a verse like that, but you have it in context, which, so the verse before verse 13, first of all says this, therefore preparing your minds for action, be sober minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Right. So then to assume that when Peter is the next three verses is Peter saying, therefore behavioral modification is the goal. When 13 said, set your hope fully on the grace, not on your behavior, not on your performance, not on all that. And so it seems to be that he's saying you should, because you set your hope on the grace, therefore you should be holy. Now here's what's interesting. He actually says as it is written, so we should go to Leviticus 11 where it was written the first time, which says verse 45, for I am the Lord who brought you out of land of, actually let's go back a little bit more. It is, he's listing a bunch of stuff about what you can eat, what the Hebrew people could eat and not eat. Right. Right. And he says, don't eat things that swarm and don't like, you know, ooh, like that's a huge temptation, but okay. Yeah. Man, those flies. Locusts, they actually could eat a weird Lena. That's the one bug they could eat. Nice. Weirdly. Yeah. Again. So for I am, you ever seen what's the movie? He'll all go where he eats the, for I am the Lord your God, consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy for I am holy. You shall not defile yourself with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground for I'm the Lord who brought you out of land of Egypt to be your God. You shall therefore be holy for I am holy. Now notice that what it says is be holy because I am holy. Yeah. And so to translate that is to be holy as I am holy as the King James typically does is an error for be holy for I am holy is the correct thing. So we're, we're inspired by him, but here's what's wild. Holy means set apart, not perfect. Yeah. Therefore be set apart by the way you eat, by the way you wear your hair, by the things you cook together and don't cook together. Most of those things were not moral. They were just ways of teaching the people be different from the people around you. And that's why Jesus disentangles those and helps explain what they're really all about. But so you'll know when you got that thing in your head that says be holy because as I am holy, understand that was not about nor was it ever about behavioral modification. It was never about a behavior. It was about being inspired to be set apart, willing to be set apart because he is set apart. Yeah. So there you go. Let's reinterpret that one. Yeah, I like that. I love that. Thank you. I'm telling you, it ripped me up when I was like, wait a minute, this sounds like God's going like, therefore nailed this because I nailed it. You better nail it. That does not fit with anything else in first computer. You can't do this. So I'm doing it for you. Especially with Peter. Yeah. You would never say that. Oh, you got to get this right. Cause Lord knows I get it right. Yeah. Sure. Peter. Anyway, it's not just struggling as you said that that sounded like a curse in your brain. Yeah. No, for sure. Before Chris sings the whole song. Before we close Katherine, first of all, I'm so thankful for you coming. It's been very enlightening, very encouraging. I think it's going to be really encouraging to our listeners and I know it's going to reach some people in a specific way. So I'm so thankful for your vulnerability and just like willingness to come on. But before we close, is there anything that you would want our listeners to know? Like if they've been in a similar boat and any of the things you mentioned or like something you would want Christians to know, like don't ever don't do this or whatever it is. What would you want our listeners to hear? I just think, I think that growing up kindness was never ever like stressed, you know, there was never a point where it was like, Hey, you know, maybe we should, which is so absurd because reading the Bible, Jesus is so kind always to everyone, you know, except for the Pharisees. Shraddha. Right. And so I think that I would have really loved, I think kindness was a lesson that I learned way later in life. And I feel like I would have been truly a better person had that been stressed religiously in my life previous to that. And I think that I think that generally speaking, obviously broadly, too many Christians are focused on being right. And too many Christians are focused on being, Oh, well, this is, this is what the Bible says. And regardless of where this person is in their life or what they've experienced, I need, I need to make sure they know what I think is right here. And it's like, is that helpful to anyone here? And is that really going to make your message heard? Cause I don't think so. That's a great point. And beyond that, I think so that like, I'm like a more personal level and then more on like a intellectual level, just being wary of anything that preaches like markets itself as like the simple and all be all right. Like, I think the people in this room are incredibly educated and know far more about the Bible and translations and all of that than I ever have. And I've studied quite a bit, you know, in addition to that, right? But, but I mean, you guys are, you've dedicated your life to this and I'm not going to be like, Oh yeah, I know that. But you know, so, and at the same time, I don't think any of y'all are out here being like, well, the Bible's simple. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, totally simple. You just read it and you know. And I think that that's a big marketing ploy for IBLP was, Hey, we've simplified it. Here are the seven principles to healthy living. Here are the five principles to raising a strong-willed child. Here are the, you know, and they were really big on that, like just narrowing it down. Here's the five things you know about this subject. It's like a formula. Exactly. Just like a formula. You plug in these factors into your life and it outputs good kids, you know, or it outputs a healthy relationship with God. And, um, and I think that that's one thing that I have a huge aversion to for sure, even with the modern church of like just an oversimplification. I like to call it lunchbox Jesus. Um, you know, yeah, he's just, it's not a little lunchbox with a smiley face on it and everybody's happy, you know? And I think that just seeking to oversimplify anything is always going to be lead you down a direction that I don't think is biblical in any way, you know? Like, Hey, we have all the answers. No, you probably don't. We would resoundingly agree with that. Yeah. And I think that's, I think that's one of the things that really drew in my parents, right? Like, Hey, we have all the answers and, and they're like, Oh, well we want the answers. We want to do the right thing. And so I'm not trying, like I said, I'm not trying to villainize anybody in I'm, I'm villainizing people in charge, you know, you should get some millstone side around your neck, right? Ouch. Um, but the people seeking God and seeking truth. I, I understand that. And I, I respect the decisions to try and provide something better for you, your kids than you had. Yeah. Um, but yeah, it just is a really dangerous slippery slope to be like, Oh, this is, this is the absolute undeniable truth. And I'm fine with you saying that about the Bible, but if you feel like you have the absolute undeniable translation of that, let's switch out a little bit. Right. Man, that's so good. Such good insights. Yeah. That's awesome. Wonderful. Well, thanks for joining us. Thank you so much. I really, I really enjoy talking about it. We may have to do this again. Yeah. This is awesome.
