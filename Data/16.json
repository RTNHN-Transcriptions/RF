We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Alright Chris, here we are once again with Colson with us to ask the insightful questions. He does that by the way really well. When I go back and listen to some of the older podcasts I'm like, oh we totally forgot to talk about and then Colson will go, wait, so what was the whole Gehenna thing about? Oh that's right, we just kind of wandered off, hey we covered it, we know what we mean. And so it's super helpful to have him, he may have to follow up with all of these we did without him and say, you forgot to this or so that would be good. But here's the conversation you and I were having a minute ago to start and then decided, no we need to talk about this. And it's this question, how do we integrate as believers this idea that we need to have an ultimate respect for an almighty, just holy and sacred God? You know we look at passages like Romans 9 that challenges who are you, you're the clay and you're going to call the potter into account, that's how that works. Or as gentle as God is I think with Job at the end of Job, he also is not soft or weak with Job. Like hey you don't have what it takes to have this conversation with me and I'll take you as far as you can go but there's only so far I can take you, I'm God and you aren't. How do we integrate the truth of that? And then we're on a podcast like this where we're questioning some really basic things about God that we, you know, how do we risk offending him and we integrate the idea that like the Apostle Paul says that we should test everything and keep that which is right or keep that which is good or the Berean church that tested Paul to scripture and Paul didn't take that as offensive. Or as we talked about a David who calls out God all the time, where are you? You've abandoned me, you know. Anyway so let's talk through, because you and I are wrestling with it so let's, I assume that probably means some other people are too. Yeah, well it's hard not to think of a parent-child relationship in a lot of ways that I want as my kids get older for sure to feel the freedom to come to me with questions or how they felt treated when I did something. Again the difference is gonna be I'm gonna make mistakes all the time but there's still always gonna be a, okay careful now you're dancing on like you're right on the edge of disrespect. Yeah. How you're asking that a lot of it is in tone and things and so I think even with this God welcomes like in Isaiah he says come let us reason together like let's think with me. Good. And like we've said before that Jesus wasn't afraid of Thomas's doubt or John the Baptist wavering. Yeah. It was fine but I think the balance is always gonna be at the end of the day my view is God has the right to not have to explain himself to everything that he does to my satisfaction. Right. Because there's a lot of times where I'm just like why we're coming up on one year since my niece died in a tragic accident and I in my mind I can't come up with one good reason why that should happen. Should have happened. But there's a certain point where I don't use that now as ammunition against God's goodness or existence I look at it as that just is demonstrating my ignorance. Yeah. And it doesn't mean it's not painful and I think that's where God is there with you in the pain like with David he's not afraid of listening to David about why aren't you answering me or you know why how long all those things but at the end of the day even David lands back on what he knows is true about God that the steadfast love of the Lord or whatever it is even with I think of Lamentations 3 where like the first 20 verses we're assuming it's Jeremiah is just lamenting what God has done like that God has targeted him and he's bitter and all these terrible things and then you get this turning point in like verse 21 and he says but but this I call to mind and therefore I have hope steadfast love of the Lord never changes his mercies never come to an end they're new every morning great is your faithfulness so he lands on what he knows about God to answer all the issues that he doesn't understand like even though this is happening I still know there's the steadfast love of the Lord and so the balance is going to be and this is where sorry integration is going to be you got me that's good I really can't catch myself I started to catch myself the integration is going to be this this respectful enough we'd have to coin a term respectful questioning respectful yeah skepticism respectful whatever but I'm coming in it humbling humble yeah humble questioning humble doubting I think I think it comes to I mean it has to come to some degree to motive like if I'm asking my wife a question am I asking because I want to understand or am I asking because I'm calling her into account right so if I come home at the end of the day and say so what'd you do all day meaning hey tell me about your day like what'd you do with the kids and what you do hanging out and how did you do with this work thing and how did you handle and but if I come home and say like what did you do all day right like those are it's one is seeking understanding and I think it's respectful and and can be positively engaged with versus you know I'm I'm I'm judging this moment I'm calling you to account and and is as inappropriate as that probably would be with my wife nearly every time it would that's where I think you would cross the line with an almighty and holy god is to come from a position of superiority and I even I felt that you know in our recent conversation with a with an atheist I felt that and and I I you know wanted to jump in with it and didn't but it's strange to me that we would consider ourselves in this day and age like judging the rest of mankind much less god from some kind of superior moral high ground like oh I look back on those people and man weren't they backwards and evil um whereas I think I I really think I don't know if I've ever told you this Chris but I really think like Genghis Khan would look at modern America and say you guys are barbarians I mean you are you are backwards and evil who who takes the lives of their own children at the rate you guys do I mean you're you are committing social suicide you are destroying your own culture at at the expense of your own comfort in general with so many different ways and and so it's a like I really think that and so I think I think we would be judged by most of the I mean the way we I don't know if you've ever read I wrote an article about the you know these four or five great moral evils of our day and you know how we treat our veterans in this country and how we have over the last 50 years I mean I think most nations I think I don't know I don't know I'm not an expert in this but I think many nations throughout history would say you you don't honor your veterans you don't honor your warriors and your older people at this like they get they get less social support than other like just random people like what are you thinking and so how we handle sojourners and immigrants and I think ancient Israel would rise up and say you guys are backwards and evil and maybe maybe a lot of so examples I think there's several of those so to me I think it's even more it's so prideful on our part if we say I put myself in a position to judge God as if I have the moral high ground that's bad enough to do with humans but with God or are or as if you have all knowledge yeah of all the facts that's right I think that it's part of our culture though the whole radical autonomy um which we've said before autonomy literally means self-law right um it and again the the integration of what we're trying to do here is there are things that we can call into question because there's there's not good reasons to keep holding on to them but you do eventually have to land the plane and land on stuff that is true and I think that the attitude of our culture right now um and this is partly in my mind because of critical theory and critical race theory and the origins of that is that we get to overthrow whatever we think whoever's in power that we disagree with we get to radically overthrow it and so I just think that this is a continuation of that way of that attitude that if I come across something in the Bible that is weird to me or I don't understand or I definitely if I don't agree with it then I get to call God I get to put God on trial and just say that was wrong you shouldn't have done that if I were God I would have which is ultimately you know terrible for me to think that I know better um than God and that happens a lot with with suffering and I mentioned like with my niece right I just I can't see right the reason but it's like in Isaiah 55 where God says my ways are so much higher is the is the heavens are higher than the earth my thoughts my ways are higher than yours um but I really think that that's the attitude that I felt coming from David Smalley was I get to put God on trial for anything that I don't like I would have done it different right um even like what's with the blood in the door post doesn't God know who and it's like well now there's another explanation but I get just anything that I think is silly or barbaric or weird that I wouldn't do or isn't in our culture um we're gonna throw that out as an argument chalk that up as another argument against the Christian God yeah so I just feel like it's it's um are you reader of Gilbert you've ever read Dilbert cartoons oh some not a whole lot so one of my favorite ones and this actually connects to a couple stories but one of my favorite ones is you know his trash guy in the early in the early cartoons his trash man the the guy takes out his trash is a super super genius okay like he like to develop gravity control and time travel and all kinds of stuff like that and um and at one point Dilbert says to the trash guy you're such an incredible genius why are you taking out trash and the genius says the trash guy says if you really believed I was a genius shouldn't you be asking why you aren't taking out trash that's good and and what struck me so there's also another connection that the movie um uh Searching for Bobby Fischer which is uh about a chess prodigy highly recommend my number one favorite movie of all time I don't know if you okay um um and uh there's a great scene where he the dad who is a normal guy um is asked by the coach the coach is like hey I see you're you know letting your son play chess in the park again and the dad says yeah he's playing better than ever and the chess coach says how would you know that and the dad's like okay you're right I have no idea if he's playing better or not I feel like at some level engaging with these conversations needs that humility yeah of okay I want to understand god I would really really like to understand why you let Chris Sherridge family member die or my friends or family or the things that I see around me to make no sense to me or or even some moral lines like why why are you so offended by polygamy or why do you call same-sex sexual encounters a sin like I don't I don't know I don't know and why do you allow evil things or why did you have them put blood on the door post now I I do get that I do know that one but the um uh that was a teaching lesson for all of us in history because there was gonna be a couple of very important cross beams that were going to have blood on him and so but um but again and when someone teaches sometimes they do things that don't make sense to the students while they're learning it um that being said I don't come at that saying you owe me an explanation who who the heck do you think you are right and um and that's a but I can still ask but I have to ask I think I think the right attitude is I'm asking from the perspective of and and I don't know how you feel about this one but even early on I would ask it this way like God if if you're there and if you're God I sure would like to understand this or could you show me this or could you teach me this um because I didn't want to come at the presupposition that he wasn't any more than I was coming from the presupposition that he was and because both to me seemed almost like cheating at one point like okay I'm going to start with the presupposition he is that seems a little bit like cheating but if I start with the presupposition he isn't that also seemed like cheating right and so because then I was holding a God who doesn't exist accountable for things that if there is no God he would not be accountable for and so that began to make no sense to me as well so I would always try to be respectful even when asking questions even when I wasn't sure about the existence and the nature of God for myself um that if there is a God he gets to be God and that seems like an important part of the conversation and I think we've mentioned this before about being honest um because we were talking to David about what what would count what would qualify as a convincing like what would change your mind what would qualify and so even someone who's deconstructing their faith to be honest in answering the question of um at what point will you be okay saying I just don't understand or I just don't agree because again if you don't have that then everything else that we say you're going to be able to throw out and say well no I don't get it I don't understand I don't agree and then you can always just so it's it's the balance of healthy skepticism sorry that may be a balance sorry okay let me take a second there so I don't know if we've talked about balance 50 years of my life it took me a long time to to stop saying too but it's purely I don't know if we have we talked about the podcast why the better word balance is not why okay let me just take a second why balance is one of my triggers what am I personal now I just feel like I'm the weird old uh guy who's changing people's opinions on stuff so um that's gonna be really loud oh that's a good point but in that's exactly right um they'll turn up on the mic really loud um the um uh okay so back to it is purely because I like people to think about things and balance is one of those words that we use like expectations or needs or something that we use it and it means something but we're using it in a way that we don't really mean what it means so like when Christians talk about we need to balance you know truth and love so in other words if you have a little bit too much truth and not enough love you just need to pull back on the truth a little bit to create balance no that's not what we mean there's never too much truth or too much love the more we can have a beach is good and so that's why so a scalding hot shower for five minutes and a scalding cold shower I mean freezing cold shower for five minutes would be balanced but it would it would not be well integrated and so that's why I want to use that and part of it is as a therapist I have people come to council say I want to learn to balance my work life and my home life and I'm like well you can't do that it's not possible to balance them you've got to prioritize what matters most to you and integrate what you can into that yeah and so balance is a Greco-Roman if you use it from in all things in moderation perspective that is a Greco-Roman virtue but not a Christian virtue seek first the kingdom of God and let everything he will add everything else to you or it's an eastern philosophy mindset of the yin and yang of balancing for every you need a little bit of evil and the good and a little bit of good and all evil and that's also not a Christian mindset now I'm not talking about being able to water ski or walk a balance beam or a slack line like that kind of balance physical balance is always healthy and there are times when it's totally appropriate for us to balance things in our lives right just like there are times when it's appropriate to have expectations we just need to make sure we're using that word would you say then because I'm trying to think of what I mean by it yeah if you're if you're talking with someone you're you're trying to discern right now do they need yeah just to hear more truth or do they need just to feel affirmed right now like you know I'm saying yes that's when I think of it that's the word that's why I say balance because I'm trying to figure out well for this person they need to hear the truth because they're whatever but this person right now that's just going to totally discourage them right so I'm integrating yes or or emphasizing or or prioritizing okay because that's why I use that word yes okay um and it's it's a weird it's a I know it's a weird quirk and even a a eccentricity as I'm becoming an old fogey that an eccentricity that some words I'm like and it's just because I've heard people beat themselves up with certain words and like when they're when they you know needs is was my first one that everyone had a need about everything like I need have emotional needs and have sexual needs and I have and the problem with the need is if I if I if you have 10 apples and I'm starving and I need one of your apples I will push you down and take your apple like that's a and I won't feel bad about it right and so if we say well I have certain emotional needs then I'm going to feel I'm not going to feel bad about mistreating you in order to get those emotional quote needs met or sexual needs or friendship needs or forgiveness and pick it right because it becomes a right like right and so I have the need to not be harmed now harm becomes in itself a and an offense or a or a I don't know an attack and so if you if you harm me but as you know as we would say talking about going to the dentist right there there is a there is a health that comes on the other side of harm and and so we I should never have to suffer like well I mean sometimes you do need to suffer in order to move on to what's next and anyway that's why so sorry I've all of you out there now you can always refer back to what was I what was I talking about you're talking about trying to balance or or what you were going to emphasize in regards to when you're talking to someone who's not a believer that's where you were going with it okay I don't know if it if that reminds you or where we were going uh it was about we were talking we'd just been talking about the searching for Bobby Fischer oh right thing about do I know how do I know I'm putting myself in a position of authority yeah I'm putting myself in a position to judge yep so I think like the example that I mentioned before we've been started recording I think is related to this where the very first time I heard someone mention John 3 16 can be seen as bad yeah I just was blown away because this guy was talking to a young gal about God's love and he quoted John 3 16 this glorious verse and her response was more like yeah that's just the kind of thing God would do and he was like wait what and he was more like a disdainful response and he's like what do you mean she's like well instead of him going he sends his son but it's because she had a dad that she grew up with that would do that he would throw anyone else under the bus to save himself and so even as we're approaching these different topics and I felt like that way with with David when we were talking about God being so holy and amazing that my response was he he lets us come into his presence he's made a way and David's attitude was more like he should just let everybody come in like why does he have to have those so it's it's almost like your attitude is you as you're approaching the question you've got to back things up and just go like well what do I believe about God and are is there a point where I can be humble enough to say even if I don't fully understand it I think there's enough evidence that's why I think in our debate with him we didn't really debate but as we were talking about a few questions I was fascinated that he didn't want to talk about science right I kind of brought up something it was kind of dismissed and I think again that that is a little bit of the attitude that we have today with a lot of young people or people in general that there's so much good evidence for there being a designer or the beginning of the universe not happening by itself not being its own cause like there's so many things there I think you can't it's it's it's a lot more difficult to argue that there's a God or that there's not a God so now everything goes goes back to but I don't like that God or I don't like the Christian God or I don't like the things that he decides or anyways I just think the issues more and more today are moral versus evidential does that make sense yep because people want to talk about God's view of sexuality and not does God exist right because you and I would go well if God exists and he designed us then he has a right to decide that right but people don't want to talk about that they just want to deal with I disagree yeah I really liked I really liked something that you used a phrase a minute ago you used the phrase once all you said at the end of the day that was the phrase you used and so I real quickly wanted to look at and know what that phrase means kind of you know once all things are taken into consideration like once once you actually end up finishing everything off well intriguingly the word balance may be appropriate here it has to do with like a balance sheet looking up where the word comes from it has to do with paying people at the end of the day probably that when you get paid off and and so you know here's your here's your positives here's what you earned but you you know you bought a soda from the soda machine and you you know whatever I'm now making it more modern but so at the end of the day here's what you earned here's what you owe here's what you get paid and so it's it's at the end of the day here's what we're left with and I think there's something very powerful to acknowledging at the beginning of the day that at the end of the day there are certain things that aren't that don't have to change and if they even if they did change so if they do change that would obviously be pretty pretty significant but barring something significant happening barring there being such a big thing I can go into this knowing I can ask these questions and wrestle through these things because I know like David ending his Psalms beginning his Psalms with where are you yeah and ending his Psalms with I praise you um there maybe there comes a point at which you don't have to put God on trial again and again and again but you can rest in certain things that that you do know so so it's a little bit of um you know you right at the beginning we start talking you referenced um you know family and parents and that kind of stuff and I referenced this on Sunday morning at this at this last Sunday about you know the the fine line of uh of offering insight to help church be better versus criticizing the bride of Christ and and how do you this is the same kind of question how do you do that how do you say the church needs to change this and the church needs to change that and this church is broken in this way and that one in this way and how do I whatever and then also say this is the bride of Christ and I had an interesting kind of confrontation those of you who aren't children don't have children won't have probably had many these moments but little boys seem to go through a couple of different phases when they think being a boy gives them an advantage over mom I don't know if you've experienced that with your boys but they there's like a developmental stage two or three of them like around three around age 10 around age 15 when they think well I don't have to listen to mom anymore because I'm male as if that right means anything right and and I don't know if that's just the testosterone moments or or if that's just the you know the pack mentality that we have of I'm gonna move up in the pack and surely maybe I can't take dad but I think I can take mom you know I don't know what it all it's about but with each of my sons they've gone through phases like that more or less and and my youngest son just went through one of those and he had this extremely disrespectful outburst against my wife ginger and uh and I kind of overheard the tail end of it and ginger you know began to discipline him appropriately and and I was like you know what I want a shot at this too and so we went out and sat on the bed of my truck and I don't always do things this way but I just I just looked in the eye and said you know what I want you to look me in the eye and say again what you just said to your mother look me in the eye and say it and he sat there silently looking at me and then eventually couldn't even make eye contact with me I was like you don't want to say it do you you don't want to say to me what you just said to your mother because you know in your heart you were wrong to be disrespectful like that and and I feel like you know that wasn't threatening it wasn't mean it wasn't anything it was I want you to think about what you said and take seriously you don't get to do that you don't get to be dismissive flippant disrespectful now you're allowed to ask your mom questions and you're allowed to even respectfully say hey I disagree with you mom I disagree with that decision I don't think I deserve this or here's a piece of information you don't have or and so going back to the picture you started with of a family interaction I think there's something to that that how do we learn part of maturing is being able to disagree with an authority argue with one gosh I'm even thinking about so you know part of a non-profit in the past that went through layoffs and and being on the executive team there and I remember at one point you know the the CEO saying to the executive team so we're all in agreement about these layoffs and having a guy on the team go no no we're not in agreement no we're not at all in agreement about this and the CEO starting to get frustrated and then someone else going like no no you just used you said agreement you meant support like you're the CEO you we totally support your authority to make this call 100 percent we don't have to agree with you to respect you to support you now it was if it had been immoral then it might have been we don't agree or support um and I understand why someone would would wrestle with that with God to say I I don't agree with this decision I support and agree that you are God and you get to make this decision but I also understand how like you said when you know when you lose a family member or somebody or or when you know I'm I have two or I'm you know sitting and listening to someone tell me about being sexually abused as a child and I'm thinking I'm struggling with supporting God that you knew what you were doing when you let this happen when you didn't strike someone down dead and where you didn't and so it can be hard for us to support God and maybe that's part of what we're wrestling with is the emotion of I I get that you're God and yet it is so hard for me to imagine what it's like to be God and it's hard for me to imagine that if I was God I would make the same decision you are so yeah and another analogy too is like in sports with your coach or even the ref where you can voice you know to a certain extent that you disagree but if he's the coach he's the coach and so that's a life lesson even with our kids of you listen honor and obey your coaches that they you might think you need to be put in for that play or that was the wrong play call or that person shouldn't be a starter versus that person but you're not the coach and so many times when it's you know it's a kid versus an adult who knows what they're doing anyways but yeah I think that's I don't know that's that's an interesting thought even of Isaiah who's a prophet of God who the first not the whole first five chapters but in Isaiah one through five at some point he's pronouncing woe on all of these other nations and people and then in chapter six he sees God and his woe is woe is me I mean well you know I'm unclean when he actually sees God for who he is so it's the same thing with question throwing God into question at some point it really does come down to this but who do you think you are we're talking about the god of the universe and we're back to the job issue too of you don't you can't do these things you don't have my knowledge you don't have all of this wisdom and so Isaiah's response was I'm a dead man like I'm undone yeah yeah I'm an unclean man and he realized his sin and that was the the comfort was right afterwards like your sins are forgiven when the angel takes the coal and touches his right but even John I think I talked about this before the apostle John who was Jesus the one that Jesus loved when he in revelation chapter one saw Jesus he just was blown away and fell at his feet as dead like he wasn't like bro hey how's it going like it was like oh my goodness when he was confronted with the reality of who Jesus really was in all his glory right and so I think that's that's that's that healthy um healthy respect that you need to have and it's really we know what it's called I have a word for it a phrase it's called the fear of the lord you're right that's exactly right and that's where so many psalms and proverbs talk about there is no fear of God in their eyes um versus someone who does fear the lord I don't know why that's intriguing why did that just hit me no I think that's really good I think that's a good even a good understanding of a passage of a phrase that actually I think does trouble people is the idea of okay you're saying he's my father he's my friend he's whatever and I'm supposed to fear him right and but I I think what's being described there is a recognition of his holiness and a recognition of his ability to be God and what it means that he's God and and here's the so here's the part that maybe maybe there's a little bit of a weird catch 22 here is that it's also about I have to be humble enough to not see myself as the expert in all conditions humble enough to not see myself as the as the professor in all classes like and and and even if I can do that in other ways how do I do it with God yeah um because I think all of us understand that at some level I guess with medical professionals or professors or something maybe I mean maybe some people don't maybe maybe there are people who you know narcissistic type people who actually do think they they are the best at any at the thing that anything else is best at and but surely most of us understand there are people who are experts at things we're not experts on and and there is a little bit of that conversation maybe so that's a that's a separate conversation at some point would be how how do you gain the humility of accepting that there would be a God who would be God if you don't accept that there is a God who would be God then how do you learn that humility right and that's a that's an interesting conversation that I would have to really think about I think to understand because I don't know that it takes humility to accept the free gift of God's grace maybe I'm wrong about that maybe it does I'd have to think more about it but it certainly does take humility to be able to engage in these conversations which how ironic that for so long what Christians what people have experienced about Christians feels like sometimes a lack of humility a pride and so if the way we're talking about it if some of this is right then man maybe it takes maybe maybe that's part of what's crippled us in some ways is that we've seemed like people who weren't open to those conversations that we were people who weren't willing to to question even our own beliefs and yet too dogmatic I think it is I think it is humbling I mean you have to be humble to receive that gift because everything in us wants to say I earned it yeah that's true there is a humbling of yourself going I'm so pathetic that I the only thing I contributed was the sin that needed to be forgiven yep I did have a I did have a let you were referencing John 3 16 and at a at a renaissance fair one time when I was asking questions I don't know if you knew I used to do that but to go out to I was a renaissance fair near here that I would go out on Sunday mornings really and just say okay what do you want to talk about I'm a Christian we'll talk about whatever and they would I would bring donuts and coffee and really and boy I got some I got some good questions yeah yes there was no filter about what questions got asked it oh it was wonderful and there was a lady who played the harp and and so a lot of these people are grow up in traditional Christian families they've rejected that or walked away from that a lot of them had but but it was still like really interesting so but what strikes me is there was a lady some of the guys asked this lady with a harp could you play could we sing um Amazing Grace together which again a whole bunch of them going out how do we I want to sing Amazing Grace like okay we obviously we sing that and she was like I don't sing that song I'm not a wretch oh wow and and thinking oh yeah yeah to sing that song you have to admit you're a wretch so there is something about that um that we there is a recognition that has to happen there and uh and what that would take but so I don't you know I don't know that we've come to any obvious clear answers here like well you do a b and c and then you'll know you're doing it correctly but knowing there's there are a lot of you guys out there who you know who are listening to this who maybe you've been asking that question of gosh it's I want to ask some of these questions but I do believe there is a god I do believe that there is a holy and righteous god and I don't I mean I don't want to be offensive I don't want to be um and I don't think we want to presume upon him and yet I do think the Bible offers us enough examples whether it's through David or through the questions or through the churches that that I think I think God can handle the questions we have and and maybe it's right to say that he would he would want us to ask the questions of him but but for our own sake the right way to do it would be humbly respectfully I don't know any thoughts to add to that no no I think that's good that's that's that's it's it's a wrestling match sometimes it's it's tough so anyway this has been this has been good for me to even talk through and maybe maybe some part of it Chris is also maybe I need to look at the rest of my life and see if the rest of my life indicates that I do treat him with respect and I do treat him as holy and high and lift it up and and maybe if the rest of my life does that then that makes it a whole lot easier right if my children are are otherwise respectful oh you know what it reminds me of uh I know we're wrapping up and then I just thought of this um a student years ago who I was discipling um a guy named Nathan and he um he decided the teacher wanted him to read a book and I can't remember for sure what the book was it may have been Kecher and the Rye but there was a book he had to read as an honor student and write a paper on and he started reading it and discovered some material in it that he thought was inappropriate for him he was like this is going to tempt me this is something I don't need to read this is going to put bad thoughts in my head and so he went to the teacher and said can you give me a different assignment I don't I don't want to read this book and here's why and the teacher said because Nathan was number one in his class by the way and he said and the teacher said I'm paraphrasing but if if you'd been almost any other student I would have just thought you're trying to get out of work right but because I know you're a hard worker I know you're respectful I know these things about you then I know your motive for this is is you just you just want to protect your heart and mind from some of this material so yes I'll let you take a different assignment now the good news is God doesn't have to guess at what our motives and our heart is and and he also knows it's imperfect and flawed so I just I think we make the effort to try to have the right heart and the right motive when we ask these questions well it's almost like your uh how Zachariah responds to Gabriel versus how Mary responds to Gabriel yeah oh yeah yeah yeah how's that going to be but apparently Zachariah's attitude was more doubting skeptical something and there was more uh the mechanics are like how can this be but again God knows the heart sounds good well if you're wrestling with this too I hope this has been helpful great it has been for me so I appreciate it and uh and we will talk to you guys next time all right all right bye thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith if you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged please leave us a review it'll help other people
