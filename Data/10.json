We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner. I'm here with my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Chris Sherrod. How are you doing guys? Very well. Nice one shot. Yeah. Normally I mess up on that. Oh man. Well, we're sitting here. It's Thanksgiving week when we're recording this. And we've been talking a little bit about this. We don't do a ton of preparation on the front end. Thankfully you guys have a lot of preparation that you have done over the years that you can draw on. And so Chris Sherrod kind of brought it to our attention of kind of starting a new series under Reconstructed Faith. So I'm going to throw it over to him. Chris, you can kind of start our conversation off today. Yeah. I think the title we had landed on was the beauty and the tragedy of the church. And so many times when you hear people talk about why you left the church or what even what do you think about those Christians? There's so many hypocrites in the church. And I think that is a big thing we need to address. First of all, what does it mean to be a hypocrite? But then also why we need the church and why we need community and how the solution for a lot of the struggles that we're talking about is going to be surrounding yourself with good Christian community. And so there's a little bit of the, can I say living in the tension, not balance? Yep. That's great. That's great. You have to get you out this time. Yeah. There you go. So living in the tension. Well, with all of this, what do you mean by hypocrite? Are you a hypocrite when you sin or what does it actually mean? What did Jesus have to say about it? And then why do we need the church? And again, a lot of people get frustrated and they, my church hop or go to all these, trying to find the perfect church, which you won't. You can find a great church, but you're not going to find the perfect church this side of heaven. Because then if you join it, that's exactly what I've heard. You better not join it. And my analogy had been, which I declarified the village movie, not the church, the village, how the whole movie is based on this idea. Like let's get away from all this evil and stuff out there and death and mean, bad stuff and start our own little. And then you discover it's actually us. Like we're, we brought it with us. As long as we're there, that's going to be, there's going to be bad aspects to it. So let's start with, cause I want to, let's end with the positives. So let's start with some of the... Did we define the church in our definition series, which I know is ongoing and running in the background. We'll be defining terms all along. No, but I think that would probably be valuable. I think it would be valuable. Can we go ahead and talk about that? And I guess because, and I think it's valuable too, because we use it interchangeably, but it can, we can mean our local church or the universal church. I grew up, okay. I grew up overseas in, in Southern Africa. The universal church was a church and it was, it was very much like they, they made you, uh, tithe half of your income and stuff like that. And so it was like hearing the universal church for a long time was like, Oh, so we don't, we don't mean that. If anybody's hearing that, we mean the capital C church across the world. That's right. But I know time and space, you actually, the, one of the great ways to divide up the idea is the visible church versus the invisible church. So the visible church would be all those people who claim Christ. Um, and the invisible church is all those who are authentically believers. So people who claim Christ can be con artists, um, or can be radically ignorant or can be just horrible people who, who you're either authentic or not in the way they claim Christ. And we can't ever know that. That's one of the difficulties honestly of, of judging Christians is that who you're judging are people who are claiming to be Christians and very many of them may not be. Um, they may think of themselves as Christians because their definition of Christian is wrong. We define that in an earlier one, but they are not following Christ. Their life is not, um, about him, but that's interesting. You say that, uh, so Paul McKenzie was preaching this, this Sunday. Did you listen to the sermon yesterday? I was there. Oh, no, I listened to it. You're right. And so he mentioned how like several church leaders without, within church history came to faith reading Psalm 130, but several of them, it was after they had been in ministry for that long. And so that's an, it's an interesting point to what you're saying. That's right. Yeah. Sorry. So you were, you were talking about church. No, that's, that's right on. And the idea of the church capital T capital C, meaning the invisible church, those who indwelt with the spirit sealed by the spirit, following Christ, chosen by him. Like that's a, that's a pretty significant concept. But what we mean is the church, the bride of Christ, his light in the world, the combination of all the individual Christians and whether they're attending a church or not, they are the church. And that's actually one of them. I went through a period of time of being frustrated with Christian publishing because they, they were allowing people to reference the church as an independent concept. I don't know if you may guys remember, but, and I won't drop names, but there was, there was some books that came out about, you know, the church needs to be doing more of, you know, I went, they would, it was very self like I went overseas to the untouchable people in India and was serving them and ministering to them with a whole bunch of my friends. And, and you know, I feel like there wasn't enough presence of the church. The church wasn't there. And the whole time I'm thinking, I thought, I thought you were the church, right? I mean, I think the church is there. If you're there, are you dividing yourself out going like, like, listen, I'm, I'm in, I'm independent of the church and I'm doing it right. And if you're independent of the church, you're not doing it right by definition as a Christ follower. But that's probably semantics. But that's when we talk about the church, we don't mean a church, a church should embody the traits of the church rightly, the great following, the great commission, the teachings of the apostles, all that. But yeah, we're talking about the church, what we're talking about today. Yeah. Anyway, so go ahead. Sorry. Well, that's a good distinction. And I think you mentioned many, when you said that word, it reminded me of Matthew seven, where Jesus says, many will come to me on that day and say, Lord, we did all these things in your name. So I'm professing the name of Jesus. And it even mentions supernatural stuff. Right. Right. And then he just says, depart from me. I never knew you. So it makes me think sometimes of a people who will be surprised by those words themselves, but also be myself being or us being surprised, wait, so and so is not here. Or like, I thought they were in, it makes me think of actually the end of the last battle when Susan's not there. Yeah. When she didn't make it and you're like, Oh my goodness. That's, you know, but again, so there's the people who claim the name of Jesus versus, you know, the authentic thing. And the hard part is you can't, you can't tell just based on what they're doing on the outside. Right. And Judas is such a great example, because we know how the story turns out, we, as soon as we read his name, we're like, Ooh, bad guy. Right. Like a pankov skit. But when you think of Jesus at the last supper, saying one of you will betray me, it wasn't like everybody goes, Oh, well, obviously it's Judas. No, but they were all shocked too. Right. Like they were going like, wait, what? Like they had, they were clueless. Again, I think John points out at one time later, looking back when Judas was complaining about the, the perfume that had been poured out for Jesus. And he's like, this could have been sold. And John actually puts his parenthetical. He actually just loved money. He was stealing from the money. But again, at the time, everybody was shocked. And I think this is a really interesting thing to think of. When Jesus sends the disciples out two by two, they're out proclaiming the message of the gospel that he, the kingdom that he told them to proclaim. And they all come back and they say, here's what we did. And we cast out demons. And you don't get any sense of, well, except Judas. Like he was dragging his feet or he was, he was in error. It's like, apparently Judas was saying all these right things. And so it's just, I think even a reminder for all of us, how you, someone can be speaking the truth, even if on the inside, they don't believe it, or they're living it hypocritically or whatever. It's still the truth. Like we're judging. You know, okay. So side comment, you're going to hear this said, and I respond negatively to it in my head, but I don't ever say anything because I know what people mean. And I know what a jerk it's going to make me look like to say it. But every time I hear somebody say something, you can't lead where you haven't been. And every time I hear that, I think, sure, you can. People do it all the time. I mean, that's a people lead people where they've never been all the time. You can't give people what you don't have. Sure. You can. People do it all the time. That's called hypocrisy. Now it's, it may be hypocritical, but it's not, it doesn't change the fact that of course there have been con artists who have played a role in people putting their faith in Jesus Christ, that people authentically follow Jesus when they were following somebody who didn't authentically follow Jesus. So of course, of course that's the case, but yeah, that's a, that's exactly the kind of stuff we're talking about. And it can be, now again, this is, this is, let me comment, because I can imagine someone listening and going, okay, so you're saying the people who mistreated me then weren't really Christians. Well, that's convenient. So let me clarify. I'm not saying that the people who mistreated you may have been Christians. Not mistreating people is a supposed to for us. Christ followers is a should for us, Christ followers, but we are all failures. Um, and so intentionally or unintentionally it is, it is very plausible, very possible bordering on universal. If you know many Christians that you've been hurt by somebody in the name of Jesus, I mean, I'm a pastor. You better believe I've been hurt by people in the name of Jesus. All of us on church staff, we we've experienced that. So anyway, just to, I don't mean to imply, Hey, if you got hurt by somebody in the name of Jesus, they weren't really Christians. No, they, they may have been. And that's, that's still the real thing. And two things I think of there. One is, um, when Paul and Galatians two had to confront Peter, he actually used the words that Peter and a bunch of the Jews, because of their hypocrisy, were leading people. Even Barnabas got caught up in their hypocrisy and he had to get confronted. So it's just a reminder, like just because you're a Christian doesn't mean that you can't get caught up. And I think Peter's motive seemed to be fear of man and wanting to look Jewish when, you know, by that he shouldn't be associated with Gentiles. But what's interesting then, since we just studied first Peter is he actually says in chapter two, I think it's chapter two, put away all hypocrisy. And it's, it's just, that's right. Again, I just love that Peter is Peter, that he is humble. And I think recognizes that. But so that's a reminder even there that even well, I mean, even leaders like Peter got caught up in not really living out the principles of the gospel. But I think it's interesting that, and this is what I'd love to discuss too for a second. For some reason, when Christians sin, big or small, I think people go, oh, see, you're just a hypocrite when you, when you sin, which isn't true necessarily. My, my response has been when I sin, I'm not contradicting the gospel. I'm confirming the gospel that I need a savior. Like this is exactly why you don't put your trust in me. And I don't put my trust in me or anybody. It's only in Jesus. So just because I sin or let you down, it doesn't mean Christianity is false. It just means I, I let you down. It has nothing to do with the truth itself, which goes back to the Christianity being objectively true. Right. And it would be a silly, for example, really silly line of reasoning. If you were to say, why don't you believe in evolution? And I would say, well, my eighth grade science teacher was a jerk and he taught evolution. You'd go, okay, that's not a good reason to not, you know what I mean? Yes, that's a terrible reason to not believe in it. So yeah, there's a lot of people, unfortunately, that have either been fake posers, which is what the word hypocrite literally means play actor. Right. That's right. Someone who wears a mask. Yeah. You're wearing a mask. That's what they, if you're in theater back in first century, you were called a hypocrite. So you're wearing a mask, but there's people who legitimately are faking, but there's also people who, yeah, they blew it. They really fell into sin. So it doesn't mean it's a full and final, like David, obviously sin really bad. Yeah. You broke pretty much all 10 within a few months. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, biology teachers don't usually claim to follow a nice guy. That's true. But you're right. That add what they add homonym that I don't disagree with the beliefs, a truth statement because of the level of jerk that the guy making the statement is. But it's certainly for us, it certainly plays out in the idea of how much does the person's life seem to back what they're claiming. And that is a fair, it is a fair judgment. If not on the truth claim itself, it is a fair judgment of the person or of the people and whether they believe it. Yeah. That's a big deal. In fact, when I talk about so much of my confidence in the gospel is the behavior of the original eye witnesses, did they behave as though that was the case? I used to use the example, you may remember this from way back in pine cove days that I would teach the directors. And when I got to this conversation, I would say, imagine if I said, came running into the room and said, Oh my gosh, guys, huge storm right behind me. There's a tornado on the ground. It can't be more than half a mile behind me. And it's coming directly this way. And all of you jump up and start going around. And then you notice I'm like pouring a cup of coffee, like an adding, adding in some cream or stirring it. You'd be like, wait, wait, I thought you said there was, Oh yeah, big one. Huge. I mean, it's death on a stick right there. And y'all probably ought to find some shelter and I'm just still sitting there chilling. You're not going to buy it. You're going to be like, that's, that's okay. Your behavior and your claim are not matching at all. Um, recently there was that big climate change conference in Glasgow and someone counted 400 private jets that had been flown in for the people to attend it. Well, whether you espouse climate change issues or what, to what degree you espouse them, that's not, that has nothing to do with that, whether there's an accurate scientific backing for that, but it does cause you to go, but do they believe it? I mean, he doesn't believe there's a tornado. He's making coffee. Do they believe there's a climate crisis? They're burning tons of fossil fuels to gather together and meet again. That doesn't mean it's not accurate. It means they're acting like it's not accurate. And that's hypocrisy. If I say, listen, the teachings of Jesus are the most important thing. And then I'm dishonest or underhanded or you know, steal or cheat or lie or what, of course you would naturally go, okay, whether I believe it or not, I'm now wondering whether you believe it, right? That's, that's hypocrisy. So what is the tension of as a believer, kind of not explaining yourself or excusing yourself, but just to go, I really am committed to Jesus and I want to live for him, but I also really am broken and I mess up all the time. You know what I'm saying? Because I think that's a good way to say it. Well, and I think that nails it. I think it's also, I mean, I'm also curious for you guys who are on stage often who, I mean, I know that there's no, that doesn't change you into a magically like, okay, I'm a super Christian, but people can see you differently. And so how do you, how do you communicate that tactfully? And is it, is it just that like, Hey, I, I struggled too. So I don't, I don't know how you would address that. Or if it's like, yeah, that's, I would say that. And then just move on. But I just think sometimes people can get the wrong idea. And so they put, they espouse maybe more of a Messiah mindset to a preacher or a pastor. And so their faith is in Jesus, but it's also faith is in the pastor. And so when the, they realize, Oh my goodness, like you were talking about Chris, the, oh, women don't have less or fewer ribs than men. So it's like, Oh my goodness, this, this pastor who's supposed to be doing this, Oh my goodness, they fail. Now my world is crumbling because I've put too much. I don't know. Exactly. Exactly. That's actually when we did talk to marriages, I don't know. Chris does this a lot too, that, I mean, my, my message to husbands and wives is you're, you are trusting your spouse to fight the fight, not to be perfect. So whatever our failures are, whatever our flaws are, whatever our character weaknesses are, my wife's counting on me to fight those fights, but she's not counting on me to be perfect. If she is, she might as well divorce me now. And vice versa. And that's what we've got to be in the church is we're trusting each other to be growing and learning and trying and even striving inspired by Christ to live these things out through the power of his spirit and acknowledging. And I think from on stage is a place for that acknowledging we're flawed failures. We are a dysfunctional family. We don't ever want to present what makes Christians, Christians is our lack of sin. That is just a lie. It's a lie. It is not scriptural. It does not. I mean, I can think of maybe one verse that you could take out of context to try to push that idea, but it's just not right. It's not the way it's taught. It's not what we're taught is not the foundation of our faith. The foundation of our faith isn't that I needed a savior. It's that I need a savior and I continue to need one. In fact, rich. Okay, here's one of my favorite rich Mullins quotes actually was at this concert when he said this. Every time you go to church, you're confessing again to yourself, to your family, to the people you pass on the way here on the way there, to the people who will greet you there, that you don't have it all together, that you need their support. You need their direction. You need some accountability and you need some help. That is a concept of the church that's much more accurate, I think, than is often treated. That we need each other and we that's in fact, as we're talking about this idea of what is the role of the church in reconstructing our faith, I think that's an important one. We do need each other as we go through this. We don't need to walk this path alone. None of this is to try to excuse, like you said, people who have been hurt or abused or whatever. It's still obviously terrible. You needed to deal with it and address it and all those things. It just doesn't mean that Christianity therefore is false. Even you think of Demas, who in two different Colossians, and Philemon, Paul affirmed and said, he's a fellow worker with me. He's with Luke. He's up there. He's mentioned. But then at the end of Paul's life, he was like, and Demas, because he loved the world or in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. So again, doing a lot of religious stuff doesn't guarantee that you won't ever turn away. I think some of it too has to do with, are you allowing? This is why in the Sermon on the Mount, it's so vital in chapter six when Jesus talks about your own personal prayer life, your own giving in private, your own fasting on your own. Because he contrasts the hypocrites with how we should do it. And he just keeps saying, they keep doing it to be seen. They're doing all of these things. They're loud prayers. They're looking like they're fasting. They're giving extravagantly. All of it is to be seen. And he keeps just going, this needs to be between you and the Lord first. And I was, Colossians and I were talking earlier about when the Ashley Madison scandal broke in 2015, 32 million names were revealed of these men who had signed up for an account with this group, The Promise You Can Have an Affair, no one will find out. But I read an article that the guy basically said, a secret life of prayer will prevent a secret life of sin. We might have talked about this in here. I remember you have said that quote before and we'll link that article. But it reminded me of a JC Rau quote where he said, praying and sinning will never live together in the same heart. Prayer will consume sin or sin will choke prayer. And so his point is not just praying you won't sin, but it's a vibrant private walk with the Lord is going to make it really hard for you to also have this deep hidden sin that you're not addressing or dealing with. And I think that's part of what is one of the first steps for people even beginning to fall away from their faith. And there's a ton of reasons why people feel far from God or deconstructing, but not listening to where your conscience of God prompting you in those little decisions, little compromises, little areas is what ends up leading to shipwrecking your faith. So in 1 Timothy, in the first chapter, he talks about that we need to fight this fight, the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. And then he says, when you reject those, it's going to lead to you shipwrecking your faith. He actually says holding faith and a good conscience by rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith among whom are Hemenaeus and Alexander. So he mentions, he calls these guys out by name. But I think that's the big step when you're not living, if you're really a believer, you've got the Holy Spirit convicting you and you don't hold to faith and a good conscience. And you're not listening to God prompting you in those little areas and you just suppress it. And it's whether it's the love of money or approval or looking spiritual, whatever it is, you end up shipwrecking your faith. That's the beginning of it though, you're going to end up shipwrecking your faith if you're not listening to God convicting you in little areas eventually. Because anytime I hear of someone, like especially a leader falling away, or I just have my prayers like, oh Lord, that could so be me, right? Like help me, hold me, let me be real. I want to nip this stuff in the bud now, just because that can happen to any of us. Right. And I do think, so let's talk just for a second on how should you respond to sin by Christians? And then I do want to turn the corner and go, so what's the great about the church? Why do we need the church and why should we keep holding on to it? I don't know if you guys remember when Anne Rice, who wrote the vampire chronicles, like interview of the vampire, she returned to her religious roots, which I think was Catholicism. She made this proclamation, like I'm back. And she even wrote a book about it, about the Jesus in Egypt story. But then not long later, I don't remember how much later it was, then she came out and I've got this quote. She said, today I quit being a Christian. I remain committed to Christ as always, but not to being Christian, in quotes, or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to belong to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. So she makes this distinction, I'm committed to Christ, but not Christians. Yep. What's your response to that, Chris? That was actually, I was looking in my quote list a minute ago, and one of the quotes, which I don't know, I remember who it was by, but was saying, people are joining, people are coming to Christ and leaving the church in droves. But I feel like that's what we've seen throughout time, is you are Christians and the gatherings at the church is still a gathering of people. And it is fundamental Christian doctrine that people can be pretty horrible, and that we need an external savior. So yeah, when I was talking to David Smalley that time, and he made some comment about, but Christians can be so mean to people, I was like, dude, I have worked in seven churches. You think I don't know that? I will witness in ways you cannot possibly imagine, unless you've been physically or sexually abused, which I did not experience either of those in the church. Everything else I think you can experience at the hands of another human I've experienced in the name of the church. And so I'm a witness that that doesn't have to drive you away from the church. In fact, my, you know, my motivation was then to see, well, can we create one that's a little more healthy? Can we create a local church that's a little more healthy? That's got a little bit more of it together. And the truth is nothing new about this. A lot of churches are pretty healthy, but they're still got people. One of my, one of my questions was, is she justified in her attitude? Like, is someone who makes the claim of hypocrisy on Christians? Let's use her language on Christians. Are they justified in making it in saying, are there many examples of Christians who claim something that isn't true that claim, can you judge the church, if you mean the gathering of Christians, not the bride of Christ, but the gathering of Christians as being unmerciful, un or lacking in meekness, lacking in mourning, lacking in hungering and thirsting and righteousness, which are fundamentally what our rabbi taught that we should do. And I would say, yes. Are we have, are there examples of Christians who've been judgmental in exactly the ways that Jesus condemned do not judge people this way? And yet have we done it? Yes. Being unkind, racist, sexist. Yes. Yeah. Those are, those are part of the history and experience of the church, meaning the gathering of Christians. Has there been sexual sin? Has that sexual sin been covered up or minimized or lied about or whatever? Yes. Have we spent money on things that would not honor God? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a huge one. Was there a defense within some churches, gatherings of Christians to defend slavery or violence or the crusades or that kind of stuff? Yes. All, all of that's yeah. I mean, it isn't that you cannot justly rightly level across time history and in the present, a charge of, but you're not doing what your teacher told you to do. Um, yes, absolutely. Sometimes in good faith and sometimes in bad faith. And that's, that's been the case. And so I understand why people would level that charge, why, um, Anne Rice or whatever her real name is, what, why she would, um, why she would say, gosh, I came back to the church and discovered, oh yeah, this is why I didn't like these people. Like that's yeah. I used to have a pin that I wore that said some of my best friends are Christians, but I don't know why that was funny to me always. Like I, I put up with them all the time and they put up with me. But so, but is that doctrinally wrong? I mean, it's, we're not following Jesus, but part of our doctrine is that we're not going to be good at following Jesus. And so I don't, I don't know how to call that a hip in some cases it's Hippocrates Christians who claim these things aren't true. They're hypocrites. Absolutely. Christians who say, man, I'm, I'm trying and I'm just, I'm just bad at this stuff. I mean, I'm just not good at it. And I forget and I'm lazy and dismissive and I'm broken and I'm hurting too. And I'm whatever. And so yeah, I miss it. I don't, I don't ask you how you're doing. And you told me last week, your child was going to have surgery this week and I didn't ask you about it the next week. And should I have? Yes. If I was a better Christian, I would have asked you about it. And man, that kind of stuff is all over us. And so I don't know how to answer the question. There's a sense in which yes, Christians can be radically hypocritical. And yet part of our doctrine is if there's a sin, we've, we've probably got it. And, and that's why we need to say, so it's come back to what you were saying. It doesn't deny my beliefs statement. It confirms it, but that's not an excuse. We do need to be becoming like Christ. We are commanded over and over again to become more like him at the individual level and as a community. I don't feel like I see it anymore, but that bumper sticker Christians aren't perfect. Just forgiven. That's exactly right. I used to always hate that. Cause I'm like, if you read that, you could read that to be totally arrogant. Like, well, there's not forgiving it. I ain't perfect. Just forgive me. I can do whatever I want. I mean, it's true. It's so it's an, on one hand, whoever said it probably meant it, you know, well, right. I'm not perfect. I am forgiven, but it can come across as yeah. I like that's what separates us. Yeah. It's not our perfection. It is our forgiveness. Yeah. I like the, the quote from Tim Keller. And again, I don't think I said this in here, but it's running all together. But he said one time, the mistaken belief that a person must clean up his or her own life in order to merit God's presence isn't Christianity. And then he says this, this means though, that the church will be filled with immature and broken people who still have a long way to go emotionally, morally, and spiritually. So it's just one of those things where this isn't a club. This is a hospital. Like we're all here learning how to become more like Jesus. And we're just all going to have a long way to go. Right. None of us have arrived. And so I guess switching gears then from, you said her name was Anne Rice. Is that what you said? Or that was the quote. So she's saying, I'm going to leave the Christians and not be associated with that. I'm committed to Christ. Right. And so we were talking beforehand of like, okay, if we're, if we're going to start with the tragedy, kind of the difficulty, the negative, but then we moved to the positive side of why we need the church. Yeah. So not just, hey, like speaking directly to that quote then, no, it's not, it's not that we're supposed to be separated. It's supposed to, we're supposed to lean into that. What, what would you talk about that if that's kind of the uptick on this, this portion of the beauty and the tragedy of the church? Well, I think you do want to find a healthy church, like there's a lot of unhealthy churches. So you want to find one that in general seems to be dealing with sin seriously and living out the great commission and, you know, serving, you know, loving each other. Jesus said that's actually one one he gives permission for the world to judge whether or not we're his true followers by whether or not we're loving each other. So that's a big one. But I think when, when Anne Rice says, I'm going to be committed to Jesus, but not the church, it would be like someone saying, I really, I really like you, Chris, and I want to hang out with you. I just can't stand your kids. Your wife or your wife. Yeah. Your bride. There you go. That's even better. I'd be like, well, here's the deal. That's going to affect our relationship. Like that's great, but I, I'm committed to my bride. And so you can't have one without the other. Like it's, I agree. And it gives us a place to work out that redemptive work. It gives us a place to live that out. The church is a place to learn to love unlovable people and to be loved, even though we're unlovable and just recognizing everyone's bad at it. I mean, that's, I don't, I don't know another way to say, but that's, that is a great role for the church. And I would say it's not possible to leave the church. If you're truly a Christian, if you're a Christ follower, you are part of the church. You are living independently from a local body, but you can't be, if you're truly a Christ follower, you can't be divided from the church. That's what the church is. It is the, it is the universal combination, whatever the role call, um, when the role is called up yonder, if you're going to be there, you're part of the church. That's Christ is coming for his church. And so I think that's, I think that's significant. But again, being just being, taking a break from the local church. Remember at our church, I mean, at our church, we do sabbaticals because we'd assume the staff needs a break from the local church. Right. I mean, that's every five years you need six weeks to get four weeks or whatever it is to get away from the local church. That's a, that's, we are hard on each other and that's the truth. There's that part where Paul talks about all the things he's been through. Right. And then he says, and on top of that, I've got the church, now the church is, I have to deal with, it's like persecutions. He's like, I've had the nine times. And he says on top of that, yeah, exactly. As if that wasn't bad enough. Yeah. Um, we are a, we are a broken bride. We are a dysfunctional family. We are all those things, but, but there's, we're still needed. You'd say about any family, about any friendships. Of course, every friendship is risking being hurt. Um, of course, every family is dysfunctional in different ways. That doesn't mean we don't need each other. When, when God, when God decided it wasn't good that Adam was alone, God did not decide to schedule more time with Adam. What he did was create another human for Adam. When Jesus sent the disciples out, the apostles out into 72 of them, he didn't say he sent them out without money, without shoes, with all those things, without extra of those things. But he said, they needed to go, they needed the Holy Spirit and they needed each other. So he sent them out in twos. And I think, I think that's why the writer of Hebrews talks about a man, if you're in the habit of not gathering together, you need to break that habit. It's, it's a need to be coming together. We do need each other. It's, it's a, y'all have heard me say this, I actually preached a series. We might even link to it a while, a couple of years ago about what the church is, what is the church? Um, I think it was in a January series, but about what the church is, what it means to be us. And, and just the recognition that we do need a place. Um, I grew up being challenged, uh, pastors would say, um, you know, Christianity, the church is not just some holy huddle, but I actually think that's exactly what it is as a holy huddle. Um, if you imagine a huddle during a football game, the huddle is where the team gets together and they make a plan and then they go practice that they go do that plan. They go enact that plan. But during those few seconds, they kind of get to take a breather, right? They're leaning on each other. They're breathing heavy. They're, you know, trying to catch a break for just a second. They're encouraging each other. They're making sure they're on the same page. You know, their, your, their hair is kind of down at that moment. They're not, you know, they may be saying stuff they wouldn't say in front of the ref, you know, they might be complaining about it. Man, I feel like as Christians, we need that. And the church is that it's a, it's a place where we're supposed to be able to come, which is part of why our attitude here is we try to, at this happen, this is not a sales job for this church and not a work sponsor, but is, and we want sacred, but we also want casual in the, the things that aren't necessary so that there's not this scrubbed excuse the language of a white man here, but this is what I was raised on was the idea of being scrubbed pink before going to church. And so, which means you look really good, look really good. You got everything put together. You're wearing the right clothes, your hair is brushed perfect. On Sunday morning, there are pictures of me as a kid on Sunday morning that is, I never looked like that ever, ever, ever, but for Sunday morning and it was a total fake out. Hey, we've got it all together. I, Chris, no, did my children know how to behave perfectly in church and it was all fear-based. I mean, it was all, Oh gosh. Well, if you disobey, people would say, don't you know where you are? That's right. And it's even the idea that, you know, most kids I think of, and we naturally just say this, we're going to church. We think of the building, but the word ecclesia literally just means gathering. That's right. It's a gathering of people. And this is, again, not another shameless plug, but the reason you need to go physically to a place is because you can't zoom, watching church by, you know, Facebook or zoom or whatever. That's literally not what the word means. Like you're actually gathering together with each other. Right. And so step one is you leave your house. Like you've got to be with other believers. And again, you've got other circumstances that are preventing that. But for the most part, it is an inferior, it's an incomplete experience. Do it that way. Yep. And bring them into your, bring them into your home or get your home out and go find them, go find other believers and gather with them together. I also feel like, yeah, as, and the, if you go through the New Testament and I don't know if you've ever done this and find all the one another verses, we have it on video somewhere. We could maybe even post that somewhere. Just it's, it's just all the one another verses running run one right behind the other forever, every like three, four seconds. And it takes four minutes to get through all the one another, all the verses that reference one another, forgive one another, love one another, serve one another bear bear with one another. Yeah. It's all these things. And so we need one another if for no other reason to practice these things, like I need people, you know, like you guys who I can practice being patient with with their, that your relationships are such that if I don't do a great job at it, you're going to forgive me for it partially so that I can be better at being patient with lost people. So that, cause there's no room, there's less room for error there and less margin for their for error there. And so we need it to practice. We need to be able to do it, to live it out. So many of the commandments in the new Testament that we get are about how we treat each other. And that's not, that's not all humanity. I think it was Paul on our staff who once pointed out to me the phrase that talks about, as you have, it's referencing the, as you have done this for the least of these you've done it for me, but there's a comma splice in there, whatever it is, the comma phrase in there that says as much as you've done it for the least of these, my brothers, and, and probably that doesn't mean the two people I'm referencing, Hey, my brothers, make sure I'm doing it to the least of these. It is the, the degree to which you do this for the least of my brothers, you do it for me. And so of course it's totally awesome for us to be taking care of some, you know, lost people around the world, whatever that's great. But, but maybe that what Jesus is referencing was my children, the ones who I have saved, that's who you need to be being extra careful with visiting them in prison, bringing them water when they're thirsty, feeding them when they're hungry. Anyway, I think, I think, I think we need one another for that. And if you find a church, um, that's not great or that can't fulfill this, or that's too unhealthy for your level of health, that you can't bring, draw them up, then it's a good, you know, I know it's tough for another part of the country. And I mean, and Tyler, you could usually walk next door to another church and, and try it out. But, um, uh, that's another series of articles I wrote not long ago about how and when to switch churches and how to find a church. Um, but man, that would be a, the truth is you're going to be hurt when you get together with Christians and some of us are going to get hurt badly and you're going to hurt. Here's the other thing to remember is you're going to hurt other people. And sometimes you're going to hurt them badly. That's part of why we need each other to live this out. That's not about being a church. That's about being humans. Is it, is you guys think it's appropriate? I've done this once, um, in the name of my family, which has a long history of, um, at least going back, starting a couple of generations ago and going back of racism and slave ownership way back there and civil war era and that kind of stuff. And I'd got to do that on a Sunday morning where I said, I think if, you know, if, if Wade Hampton was here and he got to hear me preach, maybe I'm being prideful, but I'd like to think that he would want to stand up at the end of the sermon and say, I am so sorry. Um, I'm so sorry for how I'm abused scripture and misunderstood it and mistaught it. And I was like, I don't, I don't know if his heart was in the right place and I'm just ignorant or if he was just a horrible person. That was your relative Wade Hampton. Yeah. Going way back. Thank you for that clarification. Yeah. Going way back and, uh, and man, so I, I felt totally comfortable saying, uh, Wade's not here. He's dead. He's been dead for a long time. So I want to apologize for that. At least the Hampton family and the leg family and the any family and the going back several generations and saying, I am so sorry for my own racist tendencies and thoughts and, and theirs. And I don't know if it'd be helpful to anybody to hear it, but man, I'm a Southern Baptist pastor, which I know that's hilarious to people who knew me well, but I'm like, I am so sorry for the pain that people out there have received in the name of Jesus. I wish there was something we could do to take that away. And if there is something we can do to help redeem that we would love to help do that. Um, but it is, it is true that people are hurt badly all the time with the church and from Christians. And so we don't ever, we don't minimizing that. And we're, I am very sorry that you've experienced that kind of pain in that way. And, uh, I promise it isn't, well, I can't know that I guess, but given what you've experienced, I feel comfortable saying it probably wasn't what Jesus wanted for you. Jesus is not afraid for us to suffer and he's not afraid for us to hurt, but usually it's not going to be the way that other people hurt us. So if somebody is listening to this or know somebody who has been hurt and like serious hurt, like abuse, what, like, how would you kind of give them next steps, especially if they've been like, you know what, I'm not going back to church. I'm assuming you would be like, maybe don't go back to the same church, right? But what would be some, because you were saying, I mean, one step is acknowledging, Hey, this is a legitimate thing and Jesus probably didn't want this for you or for his church. What are, what's something else that, that we could encourage people with? Yeah. Well, what I was going to say was don't use that as an excuse to not go to church or to not consider Christianity as true. And I think some people do that. Like, well, that's why I've rejected it because of all, and you just kind of go, well, but it's, we're acknowledging there, there are people who claim the name of Jesus, but it doesn't mean that they're, they're legitimate. There's, I think it's in first John four, I think where he says they went out from us. They left the church basically, but that was actually proof that they were never really part of us. Um, anyways, so it just, just because again, they're claiming the name doesn't mean that they're really believers. But so my, my first advice really is don't let that be your excuse for not going because, well, it's not perfect. And it's like, well, that we're not ever claiming that we're perfect. At least we're not supposed to be only Jesus is perfect. But I think in defense of the church and how wonderful it is, God chose to use the church and to assign the commission, the great commission to go out to all the world through the church. And so, um, that's the right avenue that if you're a believer in Jesus, you should be seeking that fellowship because you have a gift to give. It's been given to you. That's not for you. And this is why here at, at our church, our big thing is that every member is a minister. Like you're, we're expecting you to be here. The only reason you would join is because you're either going to teach or serve. Right. And so you're not just looking for a place to go where I feel entertained or affirmed, or I had a good time, or it's like more like a show, but it's, I'm here plugging in to use the gift that God has given me for a reason to build up his church and to minister the lost. And so, again, I think testing your own motives, it's like I shared before when I had students that were, you know, going off saying, I'm going to go try to discover truth and, and it's like, they're going to consider everything but Christianity, which again, I'm just glad they were going to really confirm or affirm their own beliefs. What do you really believe? That's great. But my warning was always, are you actually looking for the truth or just the philosophy that lets you live like you want? So if you're looking for excuses to not embrace Christianity, well, there's always going to be people who are going to let you down. But the church itself, this is why I love just looking historically at all the things that the church has done as far as impacting the world and during plagues, going in and ministering to the sick. And, you know, I just love Amy Carmichael's story of going to live in India as a missionary for 55 years without furlough to rescue girls who are basically in being enslaved, part of prostitution, temple prostitution. Like you don't, that's not motivated by anything other than God has changed my heart and I'm willing to risk everything for him. So there's so many amazing things that the church has done and is doing. Samaritan's Purse coming in when there's a tragedy or a, you know, natural disaster. So again, it's, there's, it's, it's awesome when God's people are really on mission together to see what they do. And there's always going to be people who are posers or just fallen, broken people. Right. But that doesn't mean you should therefore throw out the church. Gosh, I've actually said before, I'm willing to accept this as a, like as a challenge, but I feel like if you go anywhere in the world where people are suffering, there are already people there ministering to them in the name of Jesus. Yeah. And, and you're going to have a hard time finding a new place that there aren't already Christians and many times serving to the point of death. Total life change, their life will be totally different because they chose to serve these people or they're all the way to the point of death. And so you're right. We don't ever want to undermine the significance and power of the church at the local level and at the cosmic level. Millions, maybe billions upon billions of people have been served and loved. I, well, you're, you know, we're about the same age, Chris. And so I grew up, remember when I had a rich Mullins concert, having rich Mullins say, you know, 40,000 children a day are starving to death. And, you know, you could take on one kid for the prices and video games every month or whatever. And, and so I did at 19 took on my first compassion child. Well, hearing them when they came here, not that long ago. And they say, you know, 15 to 20,000 children a day starve to death. Now, the population has doubled worldwide since I was that age. And yet they're saying that. And so it's half the number. Why it's because of ministries like compassion and world vision and others that are feeding and educating and taking care of these kids all around the world. And all of that comes from the pockets of Christians in addition to their tax dollars, in addition to their, all that stuff. And so I don't, I don't ever want to minimize. Yeah. I love being a part of the church. Mine was a Petra concert. Petra concert. There you go. Yep. Wow. So great. But I, again, you might have to, you know, who Petra is. Okay. Almost all of their albums for sure had a song that was about that, you know, hungry eye and her, not hungry eyes. That's hungry. I was different. I know what you're talking about. Um, anyways, but yeah, that's when I first heard about compassion where I was like, what is, um, you know, what is this all about? And interesting statistic. When we were in, um, El Salvador, the, uh, the lady that we were working with, um, hollow eyes, hollow eyes. No, I, you said Petra. And I'm like, that, that runs in like the fourth grade. We did like an interpret. No, no, we did, we did a interpretive dance to the color song. Wow. That's fine. Anyways, I did not mean to lead us down that that's a great song, but in El Salvador, um, the lady we were dealing with for the ministry that was going on, um, her husband worked for compassion and he had grown up, he and his brother were sponsored and that got them through, I think even college and it was really cool. But what in El Salvador, there is terrible, um, gang presence, like a whole lot of like, you have to pay us to safely pass through this area or we're going to, you know, harm you or kill you or whatever. But the leader of compassion international in El Salvador, the, the, the head of one of the biggest gangs there wanted to meet with him. And so they arranged this meeting and he, they had to sit back to back and he said, we don't want you actually to, for your own safety to be able to see me so that you just for your own safety, it was, but this is what's crazy. The head of the gangs, they're said to the compassion guy, we want you to keep doing what you're, what you're doing. In fact, we're going to protect you because a lot of their gang members, when they're in prison, it's the, it's the, the ministry of compassion international that's ministering to their children while they're in prison. And they, he actually said, we don't want our kids to grow up and be like us. Right. And so part of the hypocrisy thing we're talking about, but I thought that was so fascinating how God would even use a, uh, something like a gang Lord to protect compassion international. But again, it's the fruit and the presence of what they're doing there. That's convincing them, like you've got something. And, uh, I just thought that was so amazing. Wow. I've got using that. So that's really, absolutely man. And by the way, is, is, if this is going to be down, you know, if you're listening to this and it's pretty close to holidays, I think it's coming out during holidays time, man, just maybe we may even need to do another one focused entirely on how do you talk to your family members about these issues, how do you deal with it on that? So I'll leave it to that. But in case you don't get to hear that one, one of the magic keys is to listen a lot. Listen, listen, listen, listen more than you talk, understand where they're coming from. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructive faith.
