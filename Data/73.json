We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Legge and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Bryn Starnes. Guys, it's good to be back with you. Good to be here. And today we're continuing kind of the politics umbrella of our conversation, politics and deconstruction with some questions and comments that we've received from listeners. This one is an anonymous listener. We're not going to read the entire thing, but we are going to read some of it because I think it is worth, if anyone else has kind of thought similar things for us to kind of clear up some of our thoughts and then kind of maybe expound a little bit on those things. That sounds great. Okay, great. So it may trigger some longer conversations too. It would be great. Totally. Okay, great. Well, let me go ahead and read this. So it says, a couple of weeks ago, the comment was made that quote, what the church believes on gender and marriage hasn't changed in thousands of years. I wish this was so, but sadly it's not. If you could accurately poll those who profess to follow Christ 50 years ago on their views on marriage, gender, LGBTQ plus rights, abortion, et cetera, and then poll those who profess to follow Christ today on those very same issues, you would see a large swing from what people consider quote, traditional or quote, conservative views on what the Bible teaches to far more quote, progressive or quote, modern views to say what the church believes has not changed with the times is far more wishful thinking than reality. The church has indeed changed. The world has done a much better job of evangelizing the church than the church has done of evangelizing the world. Great. Perfect. That's probably a good place to stop. Great. Sounds good. All righty. Bryn, what were your thoughts when you were reading over this? Yeah, I think my initial thought is it may just be a misunderstanding of how we were using the word church. Okay. Because, which is a good delineation to talk about because when we use the word, when the word church is used in lots of different contexts, it has a lot of different meanings. And so do we mean like the church as in the current body, like he's saying, the current body of pollable people who consider to be Christians? Or members of churches? Yes, or members of churches. Do we mean strictly Bible believing? Do we mean evangelical? Do we mean like a certain, the church as in biblical theology? Like what exactly do we mean? So that's a good delineation that I think needs to be made. But I think a lot of his points I think we would have agreed with. We just... I think probably did, probably in the podcast made the same point. Yes, we just... We have been changing. ...have different understandings of what we meant by church. Is that how you like it? Yeah, I think so. I think what we're talking about is the traditional Christian worldview. And so maybe that is somehow begging the question. It's not really circular reasoning to say the traditional view hasn't changed because traditional views don't change by definition or they're not the traditional view. That's the point we're making is that it is a traditional view that does not change. And therefore, for thousands of years has not changed. The biblical stance and really in that podcast we were going back to the kind of the sexual revolution. And so meaning up until the sexual revolution, our views on that item. So if we go back and listen to it, here's the point we were making was that the Christian view on something hasn't changed for thousands of years. Then a new topic is brought to the table, birth control, for example, or women's rights and a different way it's brought to the table or divorce law gets brought to the table. Well, Christian's views on that topic has not changed for a couple thousand years or the Judeo-Christian view for 3000, 4000 years. Then the culture begins to attack that and they say, hey, you know, we say that single parenting is just as good as moms and dads being in the home together. We say it's just as good. And the Christians come out and say, no, the biblical model, the nuclear model is the best option. It doesn't mean it's the only option. It's just the best option. We believe God's word teaches us is the best option. And the progressive says, why are you always talking about this? You're so hateful and judgmental. Like, no, our view hasn't changed. Now, the point that the person writing in is making is, and then over time, sometimes the church's view begins to change and the church's view changes and changes. And sometimes it needs to change. Like I would agree with the birth control is a topic that needed to probably change. Are there negative consequences to birth control in the culture? Yes. Is birth control immoral or unbiblical? I don't think so. We could discuss that on a different podcast at some point, depending on what type of birth control you're talking about. As long as it doesn't take the life of a child, of a conceived child, then I don't understand how it would be. But that's an example. The church changed its views. Not everyone in the church changed their views. As he's saying, if you polled, you would still have many people in the church who would say birth control is wrong, especially in the Catholic church. What we're talking about is when the culture hits, when a new topic in the progressive movement hits, like LGBTQ, same-sex marriage. But when it hit, at that point, the church's view had not changed in thousands of years. By church, you mean like most? At that time, essentially the entire church. So until that topic came, almost everyone who called themselves a Christian, I mean that was when Barack Obama, who was a liberal president, took a stand against same-sex marriage. So he called himself a Christian. He was from a Christian, a different version of Christianity, a progressive version of Christianity. But he also took that stance because pretty much everyone who said they were a Christian took that stance. No, we protect same-sex marriage. We protect marriage as being between a man and one woman. When the culture hit, that begins to chip away at the church's conservative view. And that's when you start hearing you're judgmental and you're closed-minded and you're like, no, we've not changed our opinion on this in thousands of years. Now, the point the author is making, or the questioner is asking is, but then it does change. And yes, that was part of the point we were making, is that when, say, transgender issues showed up, the church goes, oh gosh, what do we believe about this? We've not had to talk about this. This has never been a topic that's been a major issue for us. And then suddenly it is. So the sexual revolution, the progressive nature does it. I don't know if I'm making sense, but when I said the line, the church hasn't changed its view in a thousand years. I mean, that is the response of the church when a new topic hits. You think that, you know, no fault, we should have no fault divorce. That would be better. Okay. That's the progressive movement. And the church says, no, no, no, no, no, no fault divorce would be bad. And the progressive movement says, why are you always talking about this? And we're like, well, I mean, we weren't really talking about it. I mean, we've kind of all agreed for a long, long, long time. So the point he's making is the effect of that has been that about half of churches now have changed their views on some of these issues. And I totally agree that is super common. And many people, even in the evangelical church, if you ask them, we run into it regularly with couples cohabitating. Like it's okay to live together before you get married. It's fine to live together before you get married. The church says, no, traditional marriage is what's best for everybody. And it's what God instructs. Why are you always talking about this? You're so judgmental. You're so closed off. You're so legalistic. You're so now I'm not saying that the view doesn't then change, but at the moment of contact, the response of the church is we haven't changed our views on this in a thousands and thousands of years. In church, meaning like people who claim to be believers as a general population. At that time when they hit, it's everybody. And then over time, you start seeing that chip away. And you're not saying church as a whole thought now, like once those things have hit, you can't say the church as a whole believes this because obviously that's not. So let me give you an example. Let's say that tomorrow what we get is that the new LGBTQ movement has added K for kids. And they've said, now we want kids to be able to engage sexually. And so we're pushing for the consent age to be 12, the age of consent to be 12. What would be the church's response? And I mean the whole church, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Episcopelians, what would the whole response be of all the Christians in the world? Absolutely not. Right. Now, of course there would be some who would go like, oh sure, you know, that's going to but the vast majority of the Christian church would say, no, our views on childhood consent have not changed in 3000 years. Boom. Now, now that and that's what I'm saying that we would be able to say, no, that's this is a bad idea. And the world would say, why are you so close minded bigoted? Why are you always talking about this? Because we'd start teaching sermons about it and we would start because it is now where the culture and the church are hitting each other. It's now where the battlefield is. If that was brought up, I'm not saying it's going to, but if that came up or polygamy, if we came back to that question, which ironically, we probably couldn't say our view has been the same for 3000 years, but has been for the last 1500 to 2000 years. And so we would say, hey, this view hasn't changed in 2000 years. The whole church would, but then the culture would begin to chip away. But we have an ethic to stand on. Yeah. And so whether you continue to stand on that ethic, that if you continue to say, you know, 20 years past Obergefell, you say, no, no, biblically speaking, a same sex couple cannot be married. So then it's more of like biblical worldview, biblically, and you can't say the church as a whole believes this anymore. No. And I would agree. And our questioner is making is the problem is the church doesn't agree anymore, which I sadly, yes, that's, that is right. That's the effect that that's the exact effect we were talking about when we were talking about that on the podcast is that when the world and the church collide on a cultural issue, the cultural makes it sound like the church is the aggressor. When the truth is the church's view on whatever this topic is, hasn't changed in a long, long time. It's the aggressor. And then they start pushing until the church does start changing its view and certain populations or denominations begin to collapse to that. And the major one of that was in the mid 1900s, which was the Bible is not authoritative. And when that got pushed, the churches that fell under the influence of saying that the Bible is not authoritative, they then began to, that they, the end, I guess their demise was kind of written large at that point. And we've seen them be slowly collapsing in the last 50 to 75 years as our questioner asked. Anyway, that clarification, I hope that I think so. So a following question that I think that I thought of was, so how do you differentiate between issues that when you're talking about it, just so that on the face, like the face value, it doesn't seem like the same for issues that the church has always had a view on and then like birth control. And then we say, Oh, actually, we do think that maybe we've been wrong about this and we need to change. How do you differentiate between something like that, where you're actually reevaluating and when it's actually the culture pushing you to change? So the, that's a great question. The culture pushing us to change is not immoral. Sometimes we need to change. I mean, you were talking earlier about a podcast about the way the church related to the Nazi party in Germany. And so there were probably those in the culture telling the church, Hey, you can support them. Well, that was, they were probably right. I mean, that needed to be a conversation. It's not that the church is afraid of accountability or being called out or whatever, shouldn't be at least afraid of it. But we then that causes us to go back and revisit it. I mean, Brandon, you and I have talked about any time a book comes out that claims, Nope, homosexuality is not a sin according to the Bible. I mean, I read it because I would love to be convinced of that. I would love for that argument to be the winning argument down the road because of my own personal opinions, which is that I don't, I don't see it gross or whatever, but I accept that it is sinful because the Bible says it's sinful. If someone could convince me it's not, that would be fine with me. I'm wrestling with that as a professional about transgender issues. What are proper treatments for transgenderism and what aren't? What are proper treatments for, you know, gender dysphoria or dysmorphia and what isn't? And I think the church needs to, a lot of times on stuff like this, the church needs to stop and take a breath and evaluate, okay, we've been challenged on something. It is very foolish for us to say, Nope, we've never been wrong. We're not wrong. We're never wrong. Our interpretation of scripture has never been well. I mean, there was that whole earth rotating around the sun thing. I mean, like there's been plenty of things that we've proven to be wrong about the Bible. It hasn't been proven to be wrong. Our interpretation of the Bible has proven to be wrong. The earth flat. Wasn't that a way, way back? Well, apparently not that far back. I mean, you know, people now. Well, you know, I'm not convinced though, just so you'll know. We're going to get a question from someone who thinks that. I hope so. I hope so too, so we can talk about it. So you're saying the fact that culture is pushing on the church isn't necessarily bad. It's then the response of why, if we change our view, why? Yes. Yeah, exactly. It should take us back to scripture. So humbly, we should be able to say, okay, maybe we're wrong. Let's go look. I mean, it's wild today to hear people mainstream, upfront, verbal, visible Christians talking about old earth. I mean, you whispered that in dark corners 25 years ago. And so maybe that the world, maybe the culture pushed and they're right. Maybe we've been interpreting that whole day thing unnecessarily rigidly. Well, like we said with birth control, maybe the initial response of birth control was not good or rock music. There you go. No, no, that was playing cards. There's a good one. Remember my child. We're mentioning a lot of very specific. Slavery was a great example. Yeah. Let's listen. Yeah. But I would say, because we and we've discussed these, what was the biblical understanding, the interpretation, but we discussed rock music. No, I don't think we discussed rock music. We, yeah. Oh, gosh. Yeah, but that's, and it goes back to what we've talked about in the past of always being humble and why it's important to know why you believe that scripture is the authority and then be humbly willing to always go back and say like, I could always be wrong. Yes. But then have a standard for how you decide whether or not you were wrong. See that's what's so cool is, so tradition, conservative, as we talked about in another one of the podcasts, conservative thinking, traditional thinking is not always morally right. And progressive thinking or liberal thinking is not always morally right. Yeah. But neither are either one of them always morally wrong. And that's the habit we get into is like we talked about, we feel more comfortable with one side and so the other side must be morally wrong. And what we've got to do as Christians is evaluate each thing through the higher authority, which is scripture, and go, okay, what does scripture actually say about this? Have we been interpreting it incorrectly? Or is there at least room for the conversation? Like we talked about women's role in ministry, is there room for a conversation or drinking and dancing? Is there room for a conversation? Or is it immoral? Or is it a better option? And so we're in the midst of all of that. And what is the right response? And it's, Colson, were you going to say something? No, go for it. Oh, well, and it's important, like we have discussed in some of the previous episodes that it's important that our worldview is determining and defining our politics and not the other way around. We're not deciding on a political party or a stance and then pulling scripture to support what we want to believe it has to be interpreted the other way. I was talking to a friend and she said that, I think I wrote down the quote because she was basically saying the biblical worldview applies to all of life, but political parties don't stand up as a worldview or religion. And we've talked about that of how we try to make them a religion. And instead the world biblical worldview is what has to define and translate that for us. But yep, that is so true. So how would you then address this for somebody? Let's say they grew up in a certain tradition where they believed certain things about maybe some of these topics that our listener mentioned, gender rights, LGBTQ rights, and then that tradition does not go back to scripture. I'm thinking of like some people in the United Methodist Church and stuff like that. How do you as an individual deal with that deconstruction when your tradition has shifted and kind of gone the way of the culture? That's a good question. Oh, interesting. So what do you do when the church authority that you're under removes itself from under biblical authority? And so I'm trying to live my life under biblical authority and under the church's authority. But then when the church doesn't do that, how do I then walk according to scripture? Or even determine if they're right or wrong because they're your spiritual authority. Yeah, I'm a big... Again, that's... Sorry, I kind of changed the question. No, no, I think that's actually a good shift. Well, you've won. I mean, we talked about very much so. That's why we... I mean, scripture is authoritative or yeah, authoritative that we go there to evaluate our leaders, just like the church of Berea did with the apostle Paul, as that they went and checked like, hey, is this really what this teaches? Does what he's teaching fit? Does it align? Is it acceptable? Or what the Samaritans did when Jesus showed up in Samaria in John 4, they went and checked. What does the scripture say about this stuff? And they came back and asked questions and you see this huge revival happening in Samaria because it turns out the guy that they thought was different than he turned out to be is the guy who they wanted him to be who he was. And so they... That's a great... They need to do that because the church authorities at the time were saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah. And so they had to go to scripture to count to have that be their evidence. And of course, the miracles and everything else Jesus was saying. But I think you have to do what in fact, the Methodist church has done, which is when the middle authority requires you to disobey the highest authority, you have to remove yourself from the middle authority's authority. And so... And that's how it worked like here. Like, you know, I mean, if John started requiring you to do things for your job that wasn't immoral and you came to me and I said, no, I'm backing John on this and you went to leadership board and they're like, no, we're backing Chris and John on this. You would go, I quit and I can't... I'm not going to do this immoral thing. There's a higher authority that I respond to. So I'm not going to do it. And the fact that the church... And this is... We've seen this in some of these churches that have fallen apart because of the narcissistic and abusive charismatic leaders that you have people later going, I don't understand why I did what he said to do. Why was I still listening to him? Why did I not run? And now it's a... That's why... But the key is that we are required to... If we're required to do something sinful or immoral or to... Which would include espousing things that are sinful or immoral, like to verbalize them, I believe this, when we know it's not true, then that's what we have to do. And that's the... There's no way around that. And so that's... Which is wild, but that's it. And so... There's a lot of praying for wisdom, seeking scripture, seeking wisdom and advice from people who are godly, but maybe outside that circle or sphere, that are... Just because I think certain personalities, it's hard for... Some personalities have no trouble going against authority. And then some, I think it's really a struggle for them to believe that the people they've placed themselves under are wrong. It's hard for them to think that they individually could be right about something and a whole establishment that they're under, or people that they've trusted could be that wrong about something. And so it's tricky. Well, and a lot of shifts aren't monumental right off the bat. It's little tiny shifts. And if you're lukewarm in your faith and you're apathetic toward your own personal relationship with Jesus, then those little changes aren't really gonna... I can just see how easy it would be to look... Oh yeah, the boiling frog model. Exactly. Yeah. You just frog in the water that's cold and then you slowly turn up the heat and the frog doesn't ever jump out. But if you throw it in hot water, it jumps out. And so, yeah, there's some principle that I think is key. But we see it happening around us all the time. And very much so in real time, we see it happening around us. And so when does it come time to say, I need to call out this error or this wrong attitude? And by the way, people do it here. I mean, they think, for example, that I think that there is gray area when it comes to women's role in ministry, or there is gray area when it comes to tobacco usage or alcohol usage or whatever. I mean, we've had people who have just come to the church, seen that that's our stance and left and going, or that I do think there's a gray area when it comes to the age of the earth. They're like, yeah, that's heresy. We're out of here. And obviously, I think they're wrong or I wouldn't believe what I believe, but I don't think they're wrong to take that view if they're convinced of that. If they're convinced that's a...it is a moral obligation to believe in a young earth, I think they're wrong. But if they really believe that, for them to stay would probably be an error, would probably be a bad idea. It's just complicated. It's not an easy... I taught this with the youth about gray area a little while back about women's role in ministry. And it was intriguing to hear some of the students afterwards going, that blew my mind that there's not like this, okay, here's the right answer. Now go and do that. And they were just weirded out. But I think also appreciative that, okay, some of these things are open to great conversation and we do that. I guess, I mean, we have a little bit more time. So Chris, you have been in ministry for a long time. You have your own children, some of them have grown. And you've done student ministry and stuff. How do you...at our church, we talk a lot about equipping the next generation. How do you bring kids up or young adults up in that kind of tension with gray area in your faith? Because I think sometimes if you don't tow the line and let's say this kid gets to a spot where they're thinking for themselves out in the real world and it's like, that can be pretty earth shattering too to be like, wait, it's not black and white about this. So I'm telling you that is that from a political perspective, to mix it in with what we're talking about now. But the entirety of the Reconstructed Faith podcast concept is how often people get out of their home and they've been taught this is the only way to think. And then what shocks them, what causes them to...and parents think or teachers think or camp directors think or churches think or pastors think, if we just teach this one way, that'll protect our kids. And the truth is they're setting them up to deconstruct because what happens is they get out and they go, wait, what? Wait there's other even Bible believing Christians, much less non, who believe all these different things and they've never been trained to work those muscles and they don't know how to wrestle with, you know, wait, the earth could be old. I thought we all got along. So the Bible is wrong. No, what your church taught you is at least open to question and they just, their brain is kind of paradigm shift, the clutch slips and they're done. And even like the extreme of that, of even things that aren't gray areas, helping them wrestle through those, which we've tried to do like worldview seminars and stuff of like even things that aren't gray areas, they need to be able to ask those tough questions still without being shamed and still be able to work through the Jesus rise from the dead. Like that's pretty, you know, non gray area when it comes to... Exactly. Pretty important to call the whole Christian faith thing. But they should still be allowed to ask those questions because if they haven't been able to push back on anything gray areas or non, and then they get out on their own. So look a way back, David Smalley saying that in the church he grew up in, he was told, yeah, you can't ask questions like that. Stop asking this stuff. You're annoying everybody. So is that a big part of that is cultivating a space for young people to be able to ask questions and then being able... First in the home. Yes. Must, it is, if the home will do it, if moms and dads can be okay and not be weirded out and not get offended and take it defensively and not... I mean, it is amazing how we take on offense for God or we take on offense for the church when it's been a couple of times I've gotten to enjoy having a parent bring in a kid for me to kind of, you know, read them the riot act. Like, you know what, we've said, I mean, one was about spanking. So they had an adult child. So you had an adult parent and their adult child. And the adult child is coming and saying, I'm not sure this whole spanking thing is a good idea. I'm spanking my kids and they come in and the parents bring them into me to read them the riot act to explain to them, like, no, no, to spare the rod and spoil the child. We're supposed to whatever. And I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of ways for us to come at this. And there is some research that indicates that at least with some kids, corporal punishment is not only not functional, but it's not healthy. It's not for every child. And in fact, what the Bible says is that we should raise up each child the way they are bent and like the way that... And when they're old, they will not depart from the path. Like that's our goal is so that they're lifelong. And for some kids, maybe corporal punishment is totally fine and even appropriate. But for some kids, it just isn't. And the parents sitting there like, that's not why I brought my kid in was for this deep conversation. But the parent came back to me later and said, thank you for guiding me on how to have an actual versus just here's the right answer, kids, swallow it and deal with it. It was, hey, let's debate and discuss. And gosh, guys, especially for young people, they need to practice. It's like telling a little baby, hey, stop falling, walk. You should be walking, walk. Nope, stop falling down. Like their brain is literally developing that stuff. And we all need to be able to know it's safe to ask certain questions. And God doesn't seem all that offended by us asking questions. We see it in the Bible all the time. And so, and I think that happens politically as part of it is people have grown up with their parents linking faith and politics so intimately as if they're inextricable. And the first time a child steps out of that and they feel this rush of rejection and that rejection gets assigned not just to, hey, kid, you're wrong politically about whatever. The first time the kid comes in and is like, I think I'm a socialist and their conservative parents are like, no, you're going to hell. I don't think those two things are connected. Actually, I don't think faith in, you're now connecting faith in politics. And I think we need to not be doing that so much. I think there's still some more to talk about here. Yeah. Oh, for sure. I don't have time today, but I think there's still another, at least one more episode. Yeah, I agree. And in the same vein of asking questions and being free, like, thank you, anonymous listener who asked a question. I'm glad that we can do it. All right. Great. There we go. Thank you.
