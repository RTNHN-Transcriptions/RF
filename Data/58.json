We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legge, and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hey there. Colson Lechner interrupting again, providing just a quick preface for this episode. I just want to let you know that the following content, while it's not derogatory or inappropriate, it is intended for adult listeners concerning the topic of sex and sexuality in the Bible. Now obviously, use your own discretion and we hope you enjoy the conversation. Thanks again for listening and here we go. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Sherrod, Chris Legge, and Brent Starnes. Guys, welcome back. Always good to be here. And we are continuing our conversation about the quote unquote clobber verses versus that. I don't know how would you describe it other than clobber verses? What are other ways that you would put into words? These are passages that condemn homosexuality as behavioral, like as a behavioral sin. They call homosexual behavior sin. That's what these passages seem to do. And I keep using the word seem because one, we're discussing them and looking at them and part of what we're doing in this podcast, these podcasts is seeing if they actually do. Do they say that? And again, we talked last time that they do or if they do, like when we talked about Sodom and Gomorrah, and if that was all the argument that was that existed, if the only place that referenced homosexual behavior was Sodom, the account of Sodom and Gomorrah, then I doubt if we would think of just homosexual behavior as sin, if that was all there was, that's not clearly condemning just consent, even consensual homosexual behavior, sin. So we've got to look at what are the other passages say? What do they actually teach Hebrew scripture, Christian New Testament, and what do they actually say about these topics? And the problem is they feel if you're someone who is, doesn't want that to be the case, or doesn't want the Bible to say that, or is uncomfortable with the Bible saying that, then when someone points it out, of course, it feels like you're kind of being clobbered with those when someone says, no, what you're doing is sin. And from that perspective, any of us who do that to any other believer, if someone comes to me and says, hey, you're you're committing adultery and that's sin. And so, I mean, I guess in one sense, you could call that a clobber passage when it comes to adultery. I think before we're done today, hopefully we'll discuss why these, because I think a lot of times in Christianity, these were not presented as, hey, here's what the Bible says about right living is that they were used more like a club. And, and that's, I think that's how they got the nickname they did is because one, it may be the, like you said, the receptive, I feel judged, I feel hated, whether that's what's happening or not. But I think very often these passages were connected with inappropriate judgment, hatred, mistreatment and abuse. And so of course they begin to feel that way. I think like, I mean, maybe you're probably, I'm sensitive to it because as a therapist, I hear about this a lot, but, you know, like Ephesians 5, 21, wives, 21 or 22, wives submit to your husbands as the Lord, as a woman, it seems like that could feel like a clobber passage. Right. I mean, have you ever, oh yeah, especially if it's, if you have, if it has been misused, which it has, and if it, if you haven't unpacked it to actually understand the meaning and you've just read it at face value or, or heard people teach it in a way that that wasn't biblical, then yeah, definitely. I feel like it would be, or the husband is using it to have his way. Right. Because it doesn't say husbands make your wives submit. It's a command of the wives. It's up to her, but men have used it obviously. And so I think where we're living, where we're trying to stay in the tension between what you just described, Chris, of no, clearly the Bible does say this and you might be taking it really personal. I said that quote, I think before that truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth. Like if you don't want anything, you know, that you're doing to be counted as wrong, then you're not going to like anything that, you know, you might find in any of these passages. Yeah, I sure don't. Yeah. Yeah. And the same, the same side of that is we're trying to say, okay, yes, the Bible does say that, but it's not our job to just say it and then disengage or just condemn someone. I think this is, I don't even probably, Brenner Colson, you guys ever even heard of Fred Phelps? I don't think so. Remember in the 90s, Reverend Fred Phelps, he would pick it like anything. Like he would pick his funerals. He would pick it. Oh yeah. Westboro. He's from Westboro. Oh wow. Yeah. Okay. He would, they would just hold up signs that said like, God hates fags. Yeah. And then there would be, and then there would be a Bible. And there'd be kids. Yeah. Oh yeah. Totally. Totally. And they would, they would, at funeral, I get soldiers funerals that the soldier deserved to die and go to hell because they were. Well, there was all this time because then they had like biker gangs and stuff would lie. I love those guys. To protect soldiers from these alleged, say Christians. But yeah, these, I mean, yeah, hate is a strong word. Like, I know we're not supposed to really use that word, but I, I really kind of hate these guys. I mean, I know that's how I probably, I want them to get right with God, but man, they, they, they have the ugliest face that you could put on Jesus. Oh yeah. Possible. Almost. So what were you saying about, what were you saying about? That's an example there of, okay. Yeah. You're, you're using the exact same passage we just read last week in Romans one or whatever, but how you're doing it is so unloving and so ridiculous. It's like, I don't even want to engage. It's like every college campus, I feel like has some preacher that they feel called to like stand on the walkway and condemn everybody. Just yell at, if you're in a fraternity, you're a junkard. If you're in a sorority or poor, and they never wanted to engage, like that's what they would yell. And they never wanted to engage personally. They never really cared. And, and, and that's where clobber passages would come from. There's plenty of hellfire and brimstone preachers. I'm sure who have quoted all these verses to prove their point into foster hatred. But I think even in the one, if we get to first campaign six today, is a good example that we skip over all the other sins that are mentioned there and just point out homosexuality that we want to mention. Yeah. Do we want to go ahead and jump into the last few passages? I think we probably ought to, because we, I mean, we talked last week about now there isn't, I mean, the gospel is all of us bring sin to the table, all of us, each of us, and only the sacrifice of Christ, as we talked about on Sunday, only the mercy seat of his tomb is our, is our hope. It isn't that some of us don't have certain sins or that some of us are tempted differently or that it, or that someone else has a special sin. And I can, I could, that somehow that's, that's what does it know all of us have, have earned condemnation. All of us will face judgment. And so it's just, I think it's just important that we, and I know part of it is, I'm imagining, you know, my friends and others out there who are wrestling through this issue, either in frustration and anger at the church and at Christians or in confusion or, or even, even if they have a very strong biblical perspective and yet are still, it's still a wrestling match, just like all of our sins are. I just, I feel, I feel the urgency to say again, as we said over and over again, this is, this is not something packing what the scripture teaches about these. And just like Chris said, we're not going to skip, that's, that's, we've already gone through some of the ones that are in that list. We've already gone over them, but this is also one of them and we're not allowed to ignore what scripture teaches. So yeah, take it away. I was reading a book the other day where it was describing the gospel in a different way. And what the way they put it was so good. He said, the only, the only ticket that gets you in is a list of all the reasons why you should be kicked out. And I'm like, that's so good. Like, that's exactly what it is. Like the only people that are, you know, qualified are just broken people. And that's you, you, and then if you don't see yourself as a broken person, then it's not like Jesus telling the Pharisees like, oh, well, I'm only here for sick people. Right. Apparently you don't need it. But when people say things like, well, but you're telling me that I have to change to become a Christian, it's like, but that's what it is. Like all of us have to change. Like you can't stay the way you are. Like God is in the business of changing us. So everyone is expected to change. Yeah. Becoming a Christian is a fundamental change, that a foundational identity level change that then of course, naturally overflows into the rest of our behaviors in our life. You don't have to make these changes in order to become a Christian. But those are the changes that we strive for in our lives because we are Christians. And we acknowledge how bad we are at it as well sometimes. So yeah, anyway, so we're in to the passage first, first, first, first Corinthians six. Chris, you want to take this to start or bring up. So in context, I always like to remind people that Corinthians were pretty immature, had some issues going on in their church with regard to a whole lot of things, whether it's, you know, unruly worship services or food, sacrifice, idols, whatever. But the chapter before was where Paul just got done reprimanding them for being so tolerant of clearly immoral behavior. So that's just been said. And then he talks about lawsuits among believers, which is shameful. It's like you guys are taking a show that the court, all this stuff. But then verse nine is where he jumps back into this list of sinful behaviors. And then he's going to end up landing on sexual morality specifically. And then he'll get into marriage next. But starting in reverse nine, it says, or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God. Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And I love the next verse because it doesn't end there. Verse 11 says, and such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. So yeah, it's good to remind you. So which, which of the sexual sins, like what stands out sexual sins in that section? Where there's three sexually immoral adultery, like, or is there? Right. I mean, sexual immoral is kind of an umbrella. Right. So really more than three, but yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I see those three mentioned there then. Yeah. So you don't unpack there the Greek. Yes. So some people have argued that homosexuality, the word homosexual or homosexuality isn't in the Bible. And that's true in the sense that the actual meaning, when you have a translation, you have our English word that we're using to best represent the Greek word. So Paul actually, because some people try to argue that this is only talking about non-consensual homosexual behavior, like between a master and a slave or something like that. And so Paul actually combines two words here to make the one word that he uses our sin of coitus. I think I said that right. We were talking about that earlier, right? Sounds pretty close. Pretty close. But in, he did that in particular to cover both the passive and the active part in a consensual homosexual act. So he's even making it crystal clear. I'm not just talking about men taking advantage of other men. I'm talking about in a consensual relationship. And it's, so it's describing lying with the man as one lies with another man, the same way it was back in Leviticus. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that in the Septuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, that's actually the word that is used for Leviticus 18. It is. I need a fact. It is. That's correct. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, this, it's an intriguing word. The idea here seems to be man liar, as in someone who lies with and engages sexually with beds with is the literal someone who a man who beds with men. And that is the, it is, it is very clear that the language is, this is something that is forbidden. And that's the same language that's used with a man lying with a woman, a man bedding with a woman. I mean, coitus is the word we use is actually the official word for sex as the medical word for sex. So, because it's the Greek word there. It literally uses that exact same. Yeah, he uses the exact same word for some of the 110 by the way, right? It's, it's going to show up again. But so it's not just that one time. So the most of the argument that people make regarding this is that the argument that people make regarding this that he's not talking about it is going back to either it not being non consensual, or the fact that homosexuality is not the exact word in the translation. Those are most of the arguments that are made. Is that right? Yes. Yeah. It's it's a it's it's not used. By the way, some people think that that Paul almost created these words. There is not a commonly used combination of words. And he's trying to make it something as crystal clear. One of the books that I had responded to said that this this phrase would have been baffling to his audience. And that's not accurate. This this, it would be as if I said, what is forbidden here is for two men to sleep with each other. And you'd go, I've never heard that phrase put together. We usually say homosexual, don't we? And so if I'm clarifying, it's what's wild is it even seems to clarify the behavior as as even independent from just even the desire. No, no, this isn't just someone who who is lusting, although that's forbidden as well, obviously, too. This isn't just someone who's tempted. This is someone who engages in betting a man. Or, as Chris said, being the other language is being vetted by a man. So both participants are listed in these in these past a lot of times we see the word effeminate, especially like the NIV, that is the receptive person of the homosexual encounter is actually effeminate is probably not a great translation. It means someone who is taking the role of a female, specifically potentially in a sex act, a male who is taking the role of the female in the sex act. Now, it could be more generally meaning who acts like a female in general, but this seems to be pretty specific. It's if anything, these two passages, kind of, in my opinion, are the ones that would be just almost impossible to explain away. And if someone says, well, but this is contextual, it's for a certain population, it's for a certain era, which I think is always a valid thing to ask about and to talk about in Paul's writings. We don't always take everything Paul says as a direct instruction to us. The problem is it's in a list, and you don't get to pick and choose things in lists. To cancel certain items out of this list, you would need to cancel, essentially, you have to treat every item in the list the same. And that's deeply problematic. So, any reference to sexual immorality is going to have to be removed as sin. Again, obviously, some people would probably love to reduce, in fact, that's kind of what people do, is that sometimes they will remove everything out of this list, God's oppressive nature or the Bible's oppressive nature, and that's what they're escaping. But the only point we're making right now is it does seem pretty clear that the Bible is saying this behavior is not okay. And it would be the same for 1 Timothy 1.9. Like that's also in a list in a similar way. I think this is related to Chris, which you said before about people saying, why are you Christians making such a big deal over this? It would be like if you picked anything else, and like if there's a bunch of drunk alcoholics parading saying, we demand that you accept this as an okay behavior, we'd be like, well, no, no. Like, why do you hate us? We don't hate you. Like, we're just telling you it's clear in Scripture, like getting drunk is bad and wrong and being a drunkard. Like, we're not picking you out of a group of people. It's just one of those things. But in this instance, in some of our culture today, it's of that list, there is a group of people of those sins mentioned that are demanding that we change our mind about it. And that's why we're going, no, we're standing by what it said for thousands of years. Why are you always talking about this? Right, exactly. That's kind of the trap you find yourself falling into. And when we look at this, list, by the way, I do think this is also important is some people have used lists like this to say, if you've ever committed one of these sins, you can't inherit the kingdom of heaven. Or if as a believer, you commit one of these sins, you can't inherit the kingdom of heaven. And that's a misunderstanding of the whole overarching message that Paul is giving in both of these books. And all through is, I think more if this is the identity that you've embraced, if this is the behavior that you've chosen, instead of following Christ, and anybody could fall into any of these sins, even as a believer. So I think, I think that's good. We are washed and like Chris was reading in verse 11. And at first Corinthians six, some of you as were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, meaning made holy, so made clean, made holy, and then justified, made right, made clean, made holy, made right, in the name of Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit of our God. Well, certainly the apostle Paul is then not going to imply you'll never commit any of these acts again. This is the same man who throughout Romans and in first Corinthians, but Romans six and seven in particular talks about how we he continues to do things he doesn't want to do, he continues to fall into temptation and sin. So that's not the, that's not what's being said either. But I think that's what all confession means is agreement. So when I confess my sexual morality to God, I am, I am agreeing with him, this is sin. I want it out of my life, please help me, you know, pay this price for me and help me find victory in this sin. It isn't implying, I don't ever do any of these, Christians don't ever do any of these. And that's that is a misrepresentation of the gospel to say that, that these things we become somehow perfect. And like we've said before, there's a differentiation in Scripture between like attraction and, and action, whether it's like physical or mental engagement. But there's even a difference between like, Hey, this is my tendence or my, my bent or whatever my sin bent and an action that I've, I've chosen and followed through with either mentally or physically, but right. Yep. So why do you think it says, do not be deceived? Let's talk about that just for a second. Because I think it's helpful when people talk about, well, can you be a gay Christian? We've discussed that. Do you mean I struggle with this? That's my, my temptation or my attraction, or I'm, this is who I am. I'm practicing this and you have to accept my behavior and the fact that I'm a Christian. What do you think? When he says don't be deceived? Well, I think, I think we see it is intriguing that same language is used by Jesus in his prophetic language over and over again, like in Matthew 24, don't be deceived, don't be deceived, don't be deceived. Because I think, I think it is a common thing for Christians, especially to face is because we're facing the pressure of a philosophy that's in opposition to Christ's philosophy, the, the worldly philosophy, the worldly mindset of the, you know, the whatever worldview. And, and it's natural for us to beget fooled into that to start believing what we're hearing over and over again and start buying it. And I think the Apostle Paul is already warning his, the, the, the Christians of that time, the disciples of that time and saying, don't, don't be deceived, which means you could be deceived into believing that these don't matter, that these aren't sin, that these aren't offensive, that these, especially when you're talking about Corinthians. I mean, he's, he's writing to Greek people who are last week were Greek pagans. And so it's how easy it is for them to say, Oh yeah, this is justifiable. This is acceptable. This is no, our justification. I love that even that word is used, even though I'm using it psychologically as well, that we are literally justified name of Christ, not psychologically justified in our own mind. Right. I think, I think that the whole wise in your own eyes, where I, where I go as well, falls hand in hand. And don't you think that it's interesting that he mentions it? I mean, he mentions it in a list, but he mentions it specifically right before all the things that pertain to sexuality. And so it seems like it is, I mean, I feel like the argument can be made that it's, it is really, it is really common for us to deceive ourselves about any thing related to sexuality because of how strong a hold it can have on us or how strong the desire can be. Or it's just, it's easy for us to be deceived or let ourselves be, believe a lie so that we can have what we want. Yeah. When it comes to sexual sin specifically. Yep. Another good point. We can deceive ourselves pretty easily. Yeah. Chris, what were you thinking? No, I think that's why, because that is a common thing today. I was talking to a person this summer who was talking about her brother and she was just saying he, that he's a practice homosexual. And she said, and he loves Jesus. And so that's just so hard to go, no, he doesn't, because you don't want to do that. Right. But it's a matter of, I don't know his level of love or his heart or things like that. But I think it is important if someone is saying they're committed to Jesus, but they're sleeping with their girlfriend or they're having an affair and they're like, but I still love Jesus. I think there's, I think it's okay to, to bring up the issue of what do you think it means to love Jesus? Yeah. And, and you know, cause people will say things like you had mentioned before, um, earlier we were talking, can't we just agree to disagree? Yeah. And I liked your response, which was, Oh, mine. Yeah. I mean, it is, it is a situation of agreement disagreement. It's just that it just means we're disagreeing with God. Right. So it's like, yeah, this is an issue of agree and disagree. I just disagree with God that this is sin. And he says it is. So it's, it's not, it's, it's not always a good, no, it is always not a good idea to be in disagreement with God and then just to take that stance, to make that argument. You know, that's not wise. Right. And, and, and I think that is part of, you know, as messed up people, like I, I love Jesus and I give into sexual immorality at times. Here's my, here's the other one. I think is intriguing is when we wrestle with someone who just doesn't agree, like they authentically try to understand scripture and their conclusion is different. Sorry. And I, I don't, I don't fully get that. I don't, you know, I have tried to understand scripture in terms of that it does not call out the sin of homosexual behavior. I don't know. It's hard to judge. I can't judge somebody else's motives. But it's, it's, it is, I don't know. I think you referenced was a Tim Keller who said, if, if your God always disagree, if your God always agrees with you, that you just have a deified version of yourself. Yeah. And that's, it is, you know, there is something to that in that I actually would say when it comes to homosexual behavior, God doesn't, God does not agree with me. I don't, I don't have that same personal stance that God seems to, but he does. And so it's not necessary for me to agree with God. When it comes to my own section, my own personal sexual temptations, God doesn't agree with me. And so I still have to sacrifice those. And when I mess up, I have to, it certainly means in that moment, I'm not loving Jesus sufficiently when I give into that sin. Fortunately, he holds on to me even when I'm, he's faithful, even when I'm faithless. But I think it is always fair for us to challenge each other in places that we, if we claim to be Christians, man, I was gonna find it real quick, but that's actually the one population we're told we should be challenging is people who claim the name of Christ, but who are living in a way that we think is the scripture teaches us sin. That's the chapter before that was where Paul said that before he said, I'm not telling you to not associate with people. There it is. You're right. It's right. He goes, because in that case, you'd have to leave the world. Like you literally can't. But what he's talking about is people who are bearing the name of brother, saying they're a Christian and they're blatantly living in sin. That's where you have a problem where there's again, as we've said, there's a difference between this is my struggle. This is my temptation versus this is what I'm doing. And I'm okay with it. And you should be too. Well, and I think one thing that, like you've said before, that's helpful of a helpful question to ask ourselves to see if we're being deceived is if, if scripture is agreeing with what I want to think and what I like in this stance, you have to ask yourself, okay, if scripture disagreed with me, would I still follow it? Yeah, exactly. And that's on any issue of like, okay, yeah, I kind of like what scripture says. But if, if it didn't, if I didn't, would I still be willing to follow Jesus? And sometimes that's a good, yes, a good question to ask of, of, yeah, am I just worshiping a deified version of myself? Am I trying to twist scripture because it's more comfortable? And it's not always the litmus test, but I think it's a good question to ask. It's certainly people good. Well, people will say, but I don't feel convicted about an issue. And even that is dangerous, is what it's saying is, unless I feel convicted, like, I'm letting my feelings be the governor of how I live my life. Like, who do I do? I agree with her, feel bad or not. It's like that. It doesn't matter what you feel about something. It's what does it say? Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, important truth there. So what are some of the other cases that people make when they're, when they're, when they're deconstructing over these sexual issues, when they're uncomfortable with it? And this is what, what inspires that? What are some other cases that are made? Because it's not always scriptural. Yeah, I think people would say it's like on a biblical basis, but not from an actual passage. And I think we've talked about a lot of these before, just in passing, as we've talked about scripture. But I think one of them that he will bring up a lot is that Christians have been on the wrong side of history before, and equate it to something like slavery, where it's like, well, we've, we've had a stance before that we've gone back on and realized we were wrong. That's one of them. Yeah. And there's no way around that. Yes, that's true. Being wrong on something. That's, it's, that is a human tendency, by the way, it's a psychological tendency for us, obviously, to when people seem to be crying wolf, they make the same case. The problem is, as, as thinkers, as reasoners, we know, that's, that's a form of the genetic fallacy, is when we say, because this, this information is coming from somebody who was not right last time, that doesn't necessarily mean they're not right this time. And we still have to discuss it on its own merits. What does the argument actually say? What does the Bible actually say? What does the case actually say? Just, I mean, there are a lot of people in Florida who just learned that when they, well, the last four times that they told us to evacuate, it turned out not to be a big deal. And then it turned out to be a big deal. And I didn't evacuate because well, the last four times we just, we really, you have to always be very, very careful about that mindset. And yes, when I go back through the list, which I did one day, when we talked about all the different steps of the sexual revolution, out of like 10 to 20 steps, I would say, are there, there's three or four of them that I would say, yeah, we Christians took the wrong side on that. And we were just wrong about that. Now, there's still Christians alive today who disagree with me, like say on, on birth control. But I think the initial response of many Christians was ended up being the wrong response when it came to birth control. Yeah. It's, I understand why I see where it came from, I can see the misunderstandings or whatever. And I even understand the argument. But in the end, I think, no, this was the wrong anyway. Yeah. But that doesn't mean again, you can be wrong about 19 things in a row. And that doesn't mean you're wrong on the 20th one. Yeah. I understand why they were treated dubiously. Oh, you guys aren't always right. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That's correct. And then the other part of it is like, okay, the, the way that, yeah, some people treated and still treat people who, yeah, homosexual people. And it's like, okay, well, that, that mistreatment is, is wrong. It's mistreatment. But that is not what we're saying. The Bible. Right. It's not the same argument. Right. There's, I think I read it. I read a quote that said there's a difference between a posture problem and a theology problem. Yeah. So you have to differentiate between those two because they're not the same. But yeah. On the problem with the wrong side of history, you could say that about any issue, right? Like people were trying to make pedophilia. Okay. Well, you guys have been on the wrong side of history before, right? You can, you can say that about any particular, anyone from that list of first Corinthians, you know, you can say, well, how do you know you're right this time? And so that's why, again, I think what you just said, Chris, is so true that a careful, honest studying of the passage means this is where you're going to land. I think with those other issues, you can look back and go like the slavery piece, like, let me show you where you got off track. And this is, this is where they were abusing this verse. So this is what this isn't what it meant. This is a great example where it's like, it's really clear. And I think you just don't like the conclusion, but yeah. Yeah. I think two of the other arguments that I hear probably the most is, and I think we've addressed both of them, but just briefly, I was born this way. And then aren't we just called to love are two really common ones. And like we've talked about, I was, I was just born this way. It's like, yeah, we were. I mean, yes, that's right. I think the argument is made a lot more complicated than, than it has to be because the, the world would say I was born this way. And therefore it is true to who I am. And it's right. Or, and even could make the argument of it's wrong for me not to act in this way. And then the Christian ethic on all fronts said, yes, I was born this way. I was born in sin and brokenness, and that affects all of me. And so that argument doesn't leave when we just talk about a aspect of sexuality. Yes. Yeah. That's a, I remember when I, so I'm old enough to remember when this was a, when this, when the argument, the question of homosexuality became the frontline of the sexual revolution. And it was super common to have people on the progressive side of the argument say, God wouldn't, or people on the, excuse me, people on the Christian side say, well, God wouldn't make someone gay. And, and then the people on the homosexual side, the progressive side of the argument saying, no, God, I made this way. I was born this way. I was, God made me this way or whatever the argument was. And James Dobson was the first person who, because he was trained as a psychologist and as a, you know, a PhD, not as a theologian, not as a, and when someone asked him that in a, in a discussion situation, he said, well, of course, I mean, it's not the one magical sin humans can't be born with. I mean, it's a fundamental belief of Christianity that we are born broken. And so why would this be the one sin, the one brokenness you can't be born with? Of course you could be born with that. He's like, I don't understand, because that should be arguing towards the Christian side of things. Like, yeah, I'll bet you were. And here's all the ways I was born broken. So, you know, hopefully we can, hopefully we can figure out how to, how to find Christ to save us from our born brokenness, our conceived brokenness. I mean, so anyway, yeah, I, I agree. I think there is, and I think there could easily be a genetic predisposition. And I don't think that has genetic predispositions have no bearing on moral behavior. We know there are genetic predispositions towards all kinds of things that we would say that everyone would agree as moral or immoral, or nearly everybody would. And it just doesn't have any bearing. It doesn't set people free to behave the way they want. If they were born a certain way. Yeah. You can't just say I have an anger, I have anger issues. Therefore it's okay for me to hit my wife or my kids. I really like Sam Alberis. The way he says it in his book is God anti-gay. And this is him speaking from a man with same sex attraction that, that he battles with. He says, desires for things God has forbidden are a reflection of how sin has distorted me, not how God has made me. So it's just, that's just that fundamental thing. And I, and this is where us living in that tension should just wake us up to go. I, we are all, just like you said, all saved by grace and we are all broken. And so I should never have, it should free us from having any condescending attitude toward any sin. Right. To think like, I would just say things like I would never, or I'm more deserving of salvation because I haven't done that. And it's just, I don't think you understand, again, your brokenness or the holiness of God. Like it's, it's like Isaiah pronouncing all these woes on these different cities. The first few chapters before Isaiah six, and then he sees the Lord and his response is, woe is me like I'm undone. I'm a dead man. And just like, that's the reality of, you can always make yourself feel or look better by looking horizontally. And then you see God in his holiness. You just realize, you know, how awesome, amazing grace is that we're just all, I just can't believe we're all here. What this book, again, that I referred to earlier was saying, it's a parenting book and it was talking about your own brokenness doesn't mean you're not qualified to, to teach the gospel to your kids. It means you're not qualified to teach moralism to your kids. You've got to be perfect. Like, of course, I shouldn't be teaching that you've got to be perfect. And then, yeah, it's just a reminder, like, man, I'm just a center raising centers. And I need, I need all the help that I can get. Love it. And then just briefly, the argument, are we called, aren't we called to love? I think rightly prioritize love, but wrongly defines it. Yeah. And I think that's something that is, is a really hard piece when it comes to having conversations with people who don't fully understand that because the, the rhetoric and culture is so strong of, of what love means and that love is affirmation. And, and I've even had conversations with, and I've even had conversations with, you know, students and friends and pointed out, like, when it comes to friendship or even my marriage, like I, we never define love as someone who will never challenge what we say. Like that's, that's never been a proponent of a healthy relationship in any other way. You know, if I have friends who only tell me what I want to hear and never push back, then that's that in my mind, they're not actually loving me well and being good friends. But anyway, so I think, I think we have to unpack a lot of what, what do we mean by love? Yes. When there is the slap of an enemy than a kiss of a friend, I'm a kiss of a, sorry, the slap of a friend than the kiss of an enemy. Sorry, I said that backwards. But yeah, we, by, almost by definition to love someone well will mean speaking the truth to them. But I think culturally we're moving away from that. I think we have to remind people of that definition just in general, and even the logic behind it of like, wait, do you, is that actually what you mean that you want, you know, yeah. And then redefine what biblical love actually is. Well, that's what strikes me. Lewis, you know, we, I think we talked about this with when we talked about the problem of pain in his book, the problem of pain, isn't it called the problem of pain? But he is Lewis. He talks about this issue in a different way. But like, you wanted this loving God, well, here's what you've got, you've got a God who loves you so much that he's not going to let you destroy yourself or do things that are leading in the wrong direction. And so that's what you signed up for. Not this, you know, kind, benevolent grandfather in the sky who just wants everybody to have a good time. Right. Like, you wanted love, this is what you're going to get. And that's the same thing with this is we're loving people. If you're about to drink poison, and it might ruin your afternoon for to hear me say no, or to knock it out of your hand or whatever, I would, I would not be loving if I knew what you're doing is wrong. And I don't tell you no, again, this whole issue dealing with your attitude and how you say it was a big deal. But of course, I just think that the idea that we would never ever tell anyone they're wrong. I mean, both sides of any issue, you know, believe the other side is wrong anyway. So you think that that what that means. But yeah, I just think that it's a misunderstanding, like Bryn said, of what it means to love. Well, and this is the other one that I'm not, I'm not being naive here. I think there is a difference between love and sex. And so very often when people say, well, I should be able to love whoever I want. It turns out that doesn't mean I should because I think I think I know that it would sound like we were being intentionally obtuse for a Christian to say, well, of course you can. I mean, you were supposed to love our enemies. We're supposed to love everybody. I'm supposed to love my family. I'm supposed to love everybody. So no, in no way does the Christian ethic tell you you can't love everybody. You certainly can. And they say, and so if the response will be, so I'm allowed, I can have sex with them, say, oh, wait, I thought I thought I thought you were talking primarily about love. But what you meant was there should be no, no limitations on my behaviors with them, not my attitude toward them. And, and yeah, so I would say I think sometimes that's a little confusing too, is that Jesus's ethic was was not merely love, love being loved. That's a, it's a little bit of a silly statement cognitively to say love is love, or I should be able to love anyone the way I want. Because obviously we don't, we don't mean that. Because no, I don't know that any population argues truly fully that. But yeah, so I think I think that's another part of the conversation. And again, I don't mean to be obtuse. And I know no one's trying to make that necessarily make that argument, so to speak. But I think that's a good thing to point out. It's still related to a book we've talked about before by Sam Elbury, Why Does God Care Who I Sleep With? It's the same argument that goes along with because it is special, because it is important. But I would even add, every parent knows that because you love your child, you will tell them no, you will put boundaries like you'll say, no, you can't do that. It's been it's because I love you. And they might not be happy about it. But it's like, it would be unloving for me to let you just keep doing whatever you want, if it's self destructive, or, you know, going to harm you in the end, or just wrong. I mean, so I again, I feel like it's just a misunderstanding of it's a redefining of love and tolerance that you have to not only can you not say that this is wrong, you actually have to affirm me in it, which gets even more and more away from what it actually means to love and tolerate someone. Yeah. And goes back to what we've talked about for months now is a lot of this is, I mean, it may be hard to accept anyway, but will be even harder to accept if you don't study and understand the character of God and have that trust that that he said, as you have said, shared the designer and definer in the first place.
