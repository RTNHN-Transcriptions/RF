We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, accompanied by my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. So close. It's been a while since we recorded, but that's pretty good. I got close. That was the second time me trying it. You didn't have to admit that. I'm back in the saddle. Oh my goodness. Well, guys, it's good to be back in the studio. I'm joining from her beautiful looking living room. Is that where you're from? From her home studio. Home studio. Yes. I'm sorry. That's what I meant to say. Well, that's great. Since we have not released a podcast in a long time and I'm excited to get back into it. And Chris, you've what we're going to talk about today. Chris has been traveling some, obviously the holidays have happened. We're now in the year 2025. So I don't know when you're listening to this. This could be years from now. That's around 2025 right now. If we seem totally out of touch with reality, it may be because it's if you are one of our grandchildren. Hi. Good to see you. Isn't that weird? Isn't that weird? That is a crazy thing. I'm just saying. Who knows? What do things ever go away? I mean, people save tapes and then they can hear, listen back to their grandparents. I think that's cool. Anyway, Chris, you were today, we're going to talk about a trip that you took specifically to our nation's capital, Washington, DC. And so you and your daughter Ellie went on this trip and I know that you guys went to a museum. You saw a really cool exhibit. Can you tell us a little bit about that? This was really amazing. And it applies directly to, I don't remember how far back we've had some episodes in the past about why we trust scripture and that kind of stuff. And we've talked about archaeology and we did some great ones. I think in fact, Bryn may have some comments on that because I think you, Bryn, did you already teach? No, I'm teaching on Wednesday. On Wednesday about some of these things. So we might discuss it a little bit. That'd be great. What's the topic again? Well, it's for the students and I'm teaching how do we know the Bible is true, specifically the gospels. But yeah. Yeah. And so this is a, this is such a great, you know, the conversation about one of the reasons why we think the Bible is trustworthy at the basic level is because of how much of it has been confirmed by archaeology. So this is not directly biblical, but it's still fascinating from a Christian perspective. So for a long, long time, the oldest churches that had ever been found in the world were from around the 300s, specifically the early 300s. And so, so you can do the math. So Jesus was walking around on earth, you know, AD 30 ish. And then probably the apostle John died somewhere around AD 100. We don't really know for sure, but around AD 100. And so you go, okay, so you have the last surviving member of Jesus's disciples, probably around AD 100 ish. Then you've got his students and the students of the other apostles. So second generation Christians living into the, you know, into the 100s by the 200s, you're dealing with the third generation of Christians or fourth, right? And so now they're, they're several, they're, they're removed a little ways. Well, in the early 300s is when you start having Rome begin to accept Christianity as a religion. And so Rome began to accept, okay, this is a religion. It's a religion we're okay with. We're going to stop arresting Christians and Christ followers. We're going to stop putting them in, you know, stadiums and executing them just for being Christian. Right? Now that's obviously way late for the first three or four generation of Christians who've already many been martyred, including most of the apostles and all that kind of stuff. So, but what some have posited over the years was that, for example, Christianity, as we understand it today, didn't come into existence until the 300s when Rome began to approve of it. And so that was the idea was Jesus wasn't God wasn't understood to be God. He was just understood to be a rabbi until, until you got all the way to the 300s. And that's when, you know, the first Roman philosophers, you know, when Constantine and others came along and said, Hey, this is the deal. Bam. Christianity is a religion and this Jesus character isn't just a teacher. He's a God. Okay. So that has been a viewpoint of many people over the years. I've read many articles by people who've made that argument. However, in 2005, although most of us didn't know about it in 2005, not until most recent, more recently, but in 2005, Israel, the nation was on, was cleaning up or trying to expand one of their excellent. They only have one, I think maximum security prison, and they were expanding the maximum security prison. And as happens in Israel, you dig in the ground for any reason, and you find a, you know, a 2000 year old mosaic. And that's exactly what happened. So they found a 2000 year old mosaic, they start unpacking it and uncovering it. And they discover that it is actually an ancient Roman mosaic, Roman style mosaic. And as they date it, it ends up being from around the year 200. So a hundred years earlier, and it's clearly a church. It's clearly a, and by church, I mean a place to worship, a Christian worship. So it's a place of Christian worship. It looks just like all the other churches from a hundred years after that. It's a very expensive mosaic. It's connected to a Roman building. All these things that's there as they start unpacking it, and they're now going to have to move the entire prison because the prison, it turns out, is built on top of a village that, you know, this happens to them all the time. We don't have that problem in America. There's, you dig down and there's dirt. That's it. Wait. Okay. Remind me the story that you were telling me of, like, sometimes they'll uncover something and they don't want to be a tourist attraction. And so then they'll just bury it. So that's exactly what happened with this mosaic. Which makes sense. It's not that big of a city. And so, and so it's like, for, if you have that ancient civilization that's been living there for millennia, that makes sense. And so the part of the issue is they've got to decide historical find exactly. They've got to decide what is worth it because again, anywhere they dig, they're going to find stuff. Right. And so, and so they've got to, they've got, so what they've got to do is really dig into it, really unpack it, bring in the archeologists. And this is happening, I don't know, hundreds of locations around Israel all the time, right? Much less all the rest of the middle East. And so each of these, each of these sites, it's like, well, what did we find? We don't know. Also far, all we know is Roman mosaic. So we got to wait until the experts can come, set fines. Someone who's willing to do it, get the funding to do it, dig it up. And everything's got to be done meticulously. Or we can just pretend like it's not there. And, and that's happened many times. And so I think I told you guys, my favorite example is, was when I was so freaked out when they discovered a first century house in Nazareth. So Nazareth, obviously being Jesus' hometown is worthy of attention and gets a lot of attention. And so they found a first century home from the time of Jesus in Nazareth, they dug it and found it next to a building as they were trying to expand the building. So the building owner is like, Oh shoot. I mean, it's like, I don't know. It's like if a bald eagle builds a nest in your front yard at your house and they're like, Hey, no more running the chainsaw, no more lawnmowers. You're no longer allowed to do anything in your own front yard. Cause there's a, but you'd be like, Oh yeah. I mean, yeah, I have an eagle and oh man. So, so that's kind of how they see it. And so then my next trip, I was so anxious to see this first century Nazareth house. Cause it literally could be Mary Joseph and Jesus house. And I mean, probably isn't, but it could be, but there are only so many. There's a, that's right. Exactly. You're saying there's a chance. And so I get there. We can't find it. The guide can't find it. No one can find it. There's no media about it there. We finally find it asking around and there's this big, you corrugated 10 wall built all the way around this section of the building. I pull back a corner of the corrugated 10 and look in and they are in the process of burying these two, this, this first century is actually was two first century houses found side by side. They're in the process of reburying the house. Now they now know where it is. They may, the may just be like, we're burying it until somebody can come do the research. Yeah. Or it may be the people who own the property buried it and they're going to build a building on top of it. And, and it's just, it's just like that stuff happened because you can't do all of it. They can't do everything over there. Anyway, it's important. Depends on a lot of your beliefs. Absolutely. Is a first century house in Nazareth important? Well, not particularly to Jews and not particularly to Muslims Christians. Yes. It would become a travel. Like, like there would be Christians who would make pilgrimages to this house on the thought that it is a tiny chance that it could be maybe Jesus's house. Now, if they dig down and find evidence that it's, you know, somehow a carpenters are a stone workers house or a wooden man. Yeah, exactly. There's gold, frankincense and Murr in the wall. Yeah, exactly. Those, those type of things. Yes. Then probably it would, it would turn around anyway. So back to our mosaic. So they find this Roman mosaic from the two hundreds. And then they find that the literally written in stone, like mosaic tiles are put down to honor. I'm looking at it here. What is it? Oh yeah. So it's honors. There's, there's four women who are honored in one list. There's another one. So again, this is significant for the role of women in the early church. Like there are seven people honored on this mosaic. Five of them are women. And so the, the, um, four women are honored. Then there's a Roman centurion who is honored as being the one who get put up the money to have this mosaic made because it's very expensive. It was expensive back then to do a mosaic, much less now. And so, uh, so he's talking about a lot of little tiles. This isn't just like, Oh, let's slap 50 tiles on here. I mean, this is like, it's what 500 square meters that they have found. Is that right? I can't remember now. It's huge. Maybe it's only 50 square. Is it the Megido is that the other Megido mosaic? What does it give on that? Does it give the specs? I'm sure it does. Again, I should have the self-fought. Okay. 580 square feet. So 50, 50 me square meters, 500 square feet, uh, no, sorry, more than that. Anyway, 580 square feet mosaic. Um, so it's huge and it's made up of stones that are all about the size of the last joint in your pinky. And so, uh, it's massive. And we're still in a video of how they moved this. Like there is so at the Bible museum, there is a video that shows how they moved it. Um, they basically dug under it, boxed it up in a huge piece, um, and slid stuff under it and all that kind of stuff. So anyway, it's a, it's wild. Um, so there's a, uh, it's a five women, these five women are honored. Four women are honored in one section. The Roman centurion, which is wild because it was illegal for Christianity was still illegal in the two hundreds. Wow. Um, in Rome, uh, apparently. And so as we understand it at least, so they, this Roman centurion paid to have this done. And then you have, uh, a fifth woman is honored as being the one who donated the table. The table it says is there for the, she donated the table for the worship of the God Jesus Christ. Wow. The worship of, actually it's three words of God, Jesus Christ. And it's, um, it's the, uh, they did a whole lot, obviously when you're doing mosaics, they did a whole lot of like, uh, initials for things and Jesus name was often done with initials, but it's the, it's the same initial that's always been used for Jesus Christ. And so, um, that this was for God, Jesus Christ. So now you have a hundred years before Constantine, but a hundred years before most of the creeds, a hundred more years or more years for most of the creeds people were at, at around the year 200, because they probably didn't start with a mosaic. So at minimum, by the time of this mosaic, by 220 ish ad, you have people who were worshiping Jesus as God. Now we would say, because scripture teaches that Jesus is God, right? And, and so we believe that, but, but this was the first like external of scripture. This is the oldest external archaeological evidence. Yes. Literally in stone is there. Wow. Cool. Yeah. It's really cool. Yep. Pretty wild. And so I was enjoying after doing the research on it and after going and studying it, I was kind of, honestly, I have to admit enjoying going back and reading some of those articles by people like Bart Ehrman saying Jesus Christ was not considered God until, you know, the early Romans decided that he was the early Roman church decided that he was. And this a hundred percent just flows that away. Yeah. Like this ends that argument, um, completely. Man. There you go. So cool. That is really awesome. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. It was really neat. Also brings up, it's like related to a lot of things that we've talked about, but I mean, that being the main one, but also so interesting to think about, like, we talked about this when you had just come back from DC, but like the fact that it mostly mentions women on the mosaic and like a Roman paying for it means that he was probably a believer, you know, and like just a lot of cool cultural things that we've also kind of absolutely. Oh yeah. Once again, we see that though, certainly there are people who there is, there are aspects of that culture of the early, of the time that early Christian was coming into creation. Um, certainly aspects of that culture that were very patriarchal. Um, there were also women, women were not seen as not significant members. Um, they were, they were a big deal in the early church for sure. Yeah. For the Christians it was, that was the case. Um, so anyway, I think that's a really, I agree that that was really cool that you've got this incredibly expensive mosaic and that most ancient church in the world honored a Roman centurion, five women and Jesus. Yeah. Um, that would, no one would have predicted that. Like, no one would have been like, Oh, that's what this is. No, you can't. It's very, it's very cool. You can't make up that. It's like, Oh, we'll find a historical evidence. Right. Exactly. That is awesome. I guess you could say it this way. No one would make that up. Yeah. I would not think so. Yeah. That's crazy. That's not how that would work. So anyway, it's a very, it's very cool. It's, it was an amazing experience. The rest of the museum of the Bible. Is it cool? It is very cool. It's a great, now we, we were kind of running and gunning that day. So this is the main thing we got to see. I've been there four or five times though. And it is a very cool museum. It's nothing cheesy about it. It is incredibly high quality. Um, they have, so speaking of Nazareth, Nazareth village, if you've ever been to Israel, you go through a place called Nazareth village, which is a recreation of a first century village or parts of a first century village. And, um, they have that group has a section of the museum that they have. And so that they have recreated a little bit of the Nazareth village in the Bible, a museum, the museum of the Bible. And so that's, it looks like first century Israel up to a point. Obviously it's indoors and that kind of stuff, but, and then they have a huge, huge area that is about the history of the Bible. Um, and has, you know, so many that has thousands of copies of the Bible and many of the, many of the very, very ancient copies of the Bible. Um, that is the, that's there. And so anyway, it was very cool. Wow. Very, very cool. Any other highlights from your trip? I know that that you didn't go expressly to, um, to go to this, uh, museum. Yeah. What did you get to do, Chris? Um, yeah, that was a, I got to go. Um, I was invited to go to pray, uh, for the opening prayer at Congress. Um, again, I don't know how people who are, you know, are very disturbed when there's not a, an absolute line, uh, absolute wall between church and state would probably be troubled to find this out. But every single day by law, uh, send the Senate and Congress when they are, when they're there is, um, is opened by prayer. Yeah. And that actually has to be the first thing. Yeah. What's that? I don't think I knew that officially. Like I didn't know that. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a great, uh, it's a really fascinating. Was that on your lifetime bingo card? Not even a little bit. Oh gosh, no, not even a little bit. That was such an amazing, I guess honor is the right word. How surreal was it being in there? Um, it was, it was like, I don't know. It's kind of, is it just a room? It's not like, so that's one of the weird things about Washington is most of these buildings are old and, and they, you know, they're a couple hundred years old or a hundred years old and a lot of them aren't really, uh, all that nice. Um, and so you go in them and you're like, Oh, I kind of thought this was going to be like some medieval palace or some modern, like, no, no, it's, it's, it's pretty plain. Also, a lot of people don't know that, that most Congress people don't show up for Congress most of the time unless there's a vote. And so, so they called us in there, the chaplain who's this awesome lady. So you're telling me that it was empty. What's funny because so afterwards, after we did the prayer, uh, Mike Johnson, whose speaker was speaker of the house and actually still is speaker of the house, met us afterwards to talk to Nathaniel Moran, who's our Congress person here. And, uh, and with, with Ellie and I, and they both said, wow, that was, that was kind of a packed house this morning. There was maybe six people in the room other than the people who were on the podium. And so there's like 10 people on the podium who all have official duties that they have to by law be there doing. And then there's the only other people in the room. There was like, once there was like a Congress person who was putting up poster board because he had a presentation to make and somebody else over here doing some type of paperwork type thing. And, and they're very limited on what they're allowed to have in the room that like, there's not many electronic devices. They're not really allowed. It's really kind of wild. Um, what is and isn't allowed. And so they just said, okay, you're going to stand here. And when you're going to stand here and wait until the speaker comes in and the speaker is going to gavel us in. And then you're going to do the prayer because again, by law, the first act has to be the prayer and then after the prayer, then Nathaniel Moran will introduce you because you can't introduce me first because by law, prayer has to be the first thing. And so, uh, it's kind of wild. He has to introduce me after I pray. Interesting. And so he has one minute to introduce me and then we're done. That was it. So I had about 150 to 200 word prayer, which is not long. Uh, the sermon on the Mount. I mean, uh, the Lord's personally 75 words. And so at twice as much time as twice as many words as Jesus did to sufficient. Exactly. I considered it. Um, it was great. It was a wonderful experience. And then, uh, the Congress person, you know, gave us some other, let us introduce to some other people and let us have some other cool opportunities that were really pretty amazing. Washington DC is an amazing place and it's really neat. And I've, I've talked about for years, you know, doing a church tour. I do a school tour every four years to DC and we've debated the thought of trying to set up a church tour to DC. Um, it's, it's tough to figure out if that's something I want to do or not, but we've considered it. We may do that someday because I'm right now, I will tell you more and more Christians are intrigued. Like they just, most Christians don't know anything about, uh, about the way our government runs. Most Americans have no clue. And so anyway, there's something to come. And in his introduction of you, which was really kind, he also mentioned our podcast. Yes, he did. That was huge. Um, for all of the people who are now listening to the podcast, because you happen to be watching C-SPAN that morning, you are a 9 exactly. You knew about all this. I'm sure, I'm sure it was at least the amount of people that were in the house. I'll bet against that. I'll take that. Wow. That's good. Anyway, it's a great, it was a fun experience. Thank you for sharing. What a good thing to do. Yeah. But, but that, that mosaic, it is just so that once again, we see that that a lot of times, so, so Billy Graham once referenced scripture as being the anvil around which the hammers lay broken. And, and I think probably you could even just say the truths of Christianity, like the truth claims of Christianity continue to be the anvil around which the hammers lay broken. And it seems like every time we find something new, um, it's not like, Oh, that really calls into question scripture more often. It is, Oh gosh, that's, um, man, that is amazing how much that aligns. So anyway, it's fun that it is fun that we're talking about this because, um, you know, I'm like, I've been preparing that talk, uh, for the students and have gone back to some of our previous podcast episodes about scripture and the reliability of scripture and archeology and all of that. And I've been relisting to them as a refresher. Um, but then also just digging into like all the other resources on all of them, some, a tiny amount of the resources that are out there. And I was just reminded how it's not like, what am I going to talk about? It's like, how in the world am I going to limit this? Yes. The 25 minutes because there's so much and it's really cool, but it's like, how do you make this like compelling, but also like fit into less than half an hour? Because I mean, it's all of our podcast episodes were longer. Every resource out there, there's so many books and thousands of hours of videos and podcasts written about the reliability of scripture, which is awesome. But I've kind of been laughing cause I was like really excited about it. And then I got into it and I was like, Oh, how I've never had to, to, uh, summarize it in such a short amount of time. Yeah. It's so true. But, but it's also kind of fun because from a student perspective, you know, true crime is like a really big deal right now. Just like true crime podcasts and, you know, shows and stuff. And people just enjoy them a lot. But, um, I don't know if we've talked about him, but y'all know who J. Warner Wallace is. He, um, started the web, the website, um, cold crate case Christianity. Oh yes. Yes. Uh-huh. Um, but he's like a fun one when it comes to this. He, you know, there's so many like reliable sources, but when it comes to like students and engaging with younger people in your life, if you find yourself in that, that sphere, he is a homicide detective and wasn't a believer and basically used his skills as a detective to decide if he thought that scripture was reliable from like all the methods that they use in forensics and, you know, eyewitness accounts and all of his like homicide skills. Right. Um, and he's like solved a lot of cold cases. Um, but anyway, he like used that method to kind of investigate scripture and the claims of the Bible and then ended up becoming a Christian. And now a lot of the YouTube videos and stuff that he does, he like integrates it with a homicide, like detective techniques, which is really cool. Um, especially for young, you know, like younger, um, people who are wanting to, to look into scripture. So that's just kind of a, that's a shout out of something that I've been like digging into lately, but all that to say fun that we're talking about this because I've been refreshing on it all weekend. Totally. That's awesome. Well, so speaking of kind of what we're teaching here at church, I know that brain, you said you're, you're planning on doing this. Chris has been going through a little bit of kind of like, what are, what our churches, who we are as a church, but you also, you mentioned something else that could be beneficial for our listeners, um, kind of as a conversation to kind of pose to our, uh, to our congregation. Yeah. And would you mind kind of hitting on that? Cause I think that conversation, that topic that you mentioned talking about, like specifically with the ladies. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm driving. Do you get where I'm driving? I think, yeah, exactly. The, so this is a, maybe, maybe unpack where that's coming from. Yes, exactly. That's, that's going to help. So this was a, um, obviously you've, if I think, I don't know what's posted of what hasn't at this point, but I know there's been some conversations about the bear, uh, man, the conversation, the bear man, the man bear conversation, that would be a totally different conversation. Um, the, uh, um, is, is, you know, the, if, uh, if asking women on Tik TOK, if you were going to run into, would you rather run into a, it'd be in the woods. Would you rather, if you were in the woods, would you rather run into a random bear or random man? And that six out of seven women said they would prefer to run into a random bear than a random man. Well, at about the same time that that was going around, some research was coming out there for the first time in American history, for the first time in 15 generations, um, that women were more likely to be leaving the church or less likely to be involved in church than men. Um, and that the younger generation, that was the case. So the youngest, that's still not true of some of the oldest, but it is the true of some of the youngest, um, women in the country and, and trying to figure out, you know, are those two concepts connected? And I'm, I'm convinced they are, um, that I think we've changed our culture to a win away, which, you know, in one sense, this is obviously a good one. Um, and this is women no longer feel obligated to go to places where they feel unsafe and unprotected. And so if a woman doesn't feel safe and protected in a location, then our culture has changed to where she does not go. She doesn't have to go. She does not feel obligated to be there. I think that it's healthy. The problem is we would hope that would be the case. Right. We would hope that would be the case. That should be the hard part is then, well, apparently, the church is one of those places that, that a lot of women don't feel safe or protected. And so they no longer feel obligated to go. So they're not going. Um, and I think there's a combination of things. It's kind of like the bear, you know, the man bear conversation, which is in some ways, uh, you could totally understand it because a lot of men aren't safe. Um, and many, many women have had very, very bad circumstances, um, and experiences through church, um, or have witnessed them secondhand because of media and social media, like making things, you know, raising awareness. But I think it's like either they've had a bad experience or they're very aware of other people that have because news of things like that travels. Yes. You know, a lot more known than it used to be. I think that's right. And so I think one of the questions that I want us to discuss, that I want our church to be discussing, we're about to have our men's retreat, um, and our women's retreat, uh, both, uh, in the first half of this year. And I want both of them to be able to have those conversations at both of those about, okay, what does this mean and what, what can we do about it as a local church? How can we create a safe place? So to speak, um, at the church, I mean, I think this is a church that's relatively safe, but would I know? Um, and so that's, that's part of the, you know, I think that's part of the conversation that we need to be having as a church is do, do women in particular believe they are safe? Do they experience a sense of that here? If not, what can we do about that? And what can we not do about it? And if so, what are we doing right? And so I just think there's a, you know, I think it's a good conversation for us to be having as a church. So anyway, thoughts, what are y'all's thoughts on this? I think, well, I have a couple of thoughts. I agree. I think from a female perspective, I think there are a lot of positives to this. I think the part that as women, we would have to be careful of is how we're defining safe. And I've had a lot of conversations with our students about this because, um, you know, it's, we've talked about this, but with the awareness and even proactivity that's come recently about, you know, raising awareness about abuse and all of those things. Um, it's also come hand in hand with like kind of redefining what safe means. And so I think you have to have conversations about that at the same time, because I think on one hand, yeah, there's a lot of women who don't feel safe around men or specifically Christian men. There's a lot of Christian authority that's been abused. Like all those things that we've talked about before are very true. But at the same time, we also have to be careful that we don't slip into the secular view of feeling unsafe, which is, um, I'm offended or I am emotionally challenged or I'm, I'm emotionally uncomfortable, um, because of like topics or things that are being talked about. And therefore I'm equating that with feeling physically unsafe, you know, like expanding the definition. Um, because I also wonder if that's like a small piece of this. I think physical safety, like all of those things is really important. But I also in the back of my mind, I'm like, we also as women have to like not adopt the world standards of saying like, man, the church in like a healthy Bible believing church may still say things that I don't like because, you know, scripture and the gospel are offensive. And I think to their credit, women tend towards empathy a lot and they tend towards really resonating with, um, I think this is what we're seeing, you know, in politics of like women are kind of leaning towards like a lot of the empathetic arguments. And so they kind of align politically with, um, political issues that seem more aligned with empathy, if that makes sense. Yeah. Right. Right. But the downside of that is like, man, if the church is calling me to something or saying truth, that's really hard when it comes to um, these topics or how I feel and is making me feel a certain way emotionally, I need to, that's fine to acknowledge, but that's not the same thing as feeling physically unsafe because of men in the church. Does that make sense? Yes. I don't know. Absolutely. No, I think those are kind of two thoughts of like, we have to separate those two as women and say like, okay, what is it that I'm feeling? Not that any of them are invalid, but they are different. Yeah. Right. What would it look like for you both to lead that conversation? Like, I don't know what you think about that, Chris, because you are the spiritual leader of our church. So I think there is a level of safety and rapport that you have with the women in our church. That would be a good question. You know, like, is that is, do we feel like there's like, would that encourage, like would that, would that somehow encourage better conversation or not? I don't know. Cause I don't, cause I don't, I feel like the majority of time that I have seen you kind of have an open discussion. Yeah. There isn't, it's been like, it's been truly open to where it's not like, Oh, well I can say something, but I'm not going to say anything because Chris is going to just shut me down or something like that. So I don't, I think your reputation probably precedes you in that. Okay. You know? And so my only question would be, yeah, would you, would having a woman leading it or having a woman, having a woman involved in helping mediate the conversation if that, and I don't know what you think about that. I think it's a great conversation. Great, good, great question to ask. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? I do. You think it would, what would it, what would it, would it, would it improve or not improve the conversation for the men or the women or there to be a woman like you there or the, as part of, part of the facilitation? I don't know when it comes to the conversation with the men. Um, unless it's like, I think the benefit that I could see to it is like, if men are like, women think that to have a woman that's like, no, actually this is, you know, that, that would be the other way. I wasn't even, I wasn't even thinking about that. That's an interesting point. Yeah. Cause I wish, I wish the women's retreat was first. Yeah. Oh, totally. I'd love to be able to report to the men. This is what we, this is what we found out. But yeah, wait, what exactly? Um, yeah, but I mean, I could see it either way. I think you're right. I think Chris handles those conversations in a way that does encourage more conversation than, you know, a lot of people. And I think people are, if they know him, they're comfortable, you know, being honest, I think, but I think if they don't know him or there's just that level of like, Oh, he's in charge, you know, just that like innate thing of like, Oh, he's in charge. I'm, you know, whatever. Um, yeah, I think there could be some benefit to it that we could discuss of like, Hey, we're doing, we're doing this as a team. This is not like a man men versus women. Right. I don't know. Yeah. Well, my, my mindset was just like my goal. My mindset was really, okay. As the leader of the church, I want to get insight from the women of our church. To what degree is this an issue? And what do we need to be doing about it? And cause it's a, it's not so much a, I'm, you know, I'm just going to be sitting and listening and asking questions for the other thing is it's not a foreign concept to our church as well. You've spoken on it multiple times that I've heard even from the pulpit. So yeah, that's great. I kind of want, I kind of want to be in the audience to be honest. Honestly, that was my next point. As long as it's not, I need to look up the dates as long as it's not close to my due date. It may be, it's an April. Planning to be there. No, I think Chris, I think that was going to be my other thought is even if you just pose the question to people who you're like, okay, I trust you. Can you come up with something like a question or something to like get conversation going? Because I think as the, as conversation moves, people feel more apt to ask questions or chime in or something like that. Right. For sure. Yeah. Well, I'll be interested to do a podcast to cover what we learned from that. Thank you for thinking of that. Go ahead. I'm also curious to know, yeah, like specifics of how many women it's like, I feel this way because of this specific reason or this specific instance, this specific church. Right. And how much of it is like, cause we've talked about a lot how it's easy in culture because of social media or because of groupthink or echo chamber, like whatever it is, it's really easy to have a feeling or make an assessment or a belief based on kind of just like a general thing. You know, like when we talked about the contradictions in scripture of like, there's just so many of them and scripture is not trustworthy. And it's like, well, which one specifically is troubling to you? And I'm curious to know like how many women, because I know for a fact there are those women where it's like, I have had bad experiences or I have specifics, but I wonder how many women it's just kind of a general feeling of like, it's just kind of a lot. It's like, you know, everybody's, everybody's had this stuff. It happens all the time. Like just men are untrustworthy. There's a lot of abuse scandals coming out. I don't, you know, that, that would, I would also be curious to know kind of where women fall when it comes to those two things. Yeah, I agree. But I don't know. Yeah, there's a lot. I think there's a lot of pieces to this. The other interesting piece, and then I don't know if this is related, but it seems like an interesting tie into me is the, excuse me, the resurgence of kind of traditional masculinity that's also happening. You know, with like even to an unhealthy standard, like what's the moustaches? Yeah. The resurgence of facial hair. No, I'm kidding. Like Andrew Tate, is that his name? The like hyper masculine social media influencer? Yes. I think that's right. I forget who he is, but anyway, he's the one of the toxic ones, right? Right. Right. Right. And he, anyway, but there is like a resurgence of kind of traditional masculinity that's happening. And also I just read recently that there, a lot of younger men are being drawn to versions of religion that kind of require more of them, which is, I don't know if you saw this study, which is like really interesting when it comes to more like rigorous as far as what they're requiring of them. Kind of like I'm, I'm being drawn to something that requires something of me and saying that evangelical Christianity has become soft. So anyway, all that to say, that's like an interesting piece of this because I think, I think there's a lot of good conversations happening about abuse and women, you know, what does it mean to be safe in church and all these things? But as women are kind of leaving the church, there's this resurgence of masculinity, which in some ways has become like the toxic versions of masculinity, which seems to be in conflict. You know, like those two things are not, are not going to play together well. No. When it comes to women, it seems like that would push women away from the church even faster of like, Oh wow, men are, you know, kind of circling back to like, well, that's a great point. Like, yeah, the church men in the church need to need to espouse the godly version of masculinity, the Christ-like version of masculinity, not the, like the type of, the type of expressing being a man that the Bible, that the Bible would support or encourage, not the one that the culture, like the culture solution is always just as bad as its problem. Right. That's a great, I probably need to talk about that. I can try to find that. Well, and I mean, I think there are, we've seen it, you know, in recent, you know, cultural phenomenon, I think the rise and fall of Mars Hill. Cause I think there are, there were elements. I was talking to some guys when we were kind of in the middle of those episodes coming out and they were saying, man, I, it was a counter cultural thing for Mark Driscoll to be calling guys out to like, get married and to be a strong man and doing those things. And it's like, even in that, how there were things that were still twisted, you know, ultimately. And so it's like, yeah, as you were saying, like, we can't just get it. We can't swing the pendulum the whole other way. Right. And then not, not truly take into account what the Bible actually says that just to be, just to be swayed by, well, this is kind of what culture is doing. It seems traditional. So let's just go with that. If that's, if that's what our guiding light is correct, we're going to, we're going to screw up something because of who we are. That's at least what I think is like, if something can be screwed up or twisted, it it's going to be, unless we have a guiding principle that is going to keep us in the right guardrails. Yes. Yeah. We, we, we limp and that's why we need a compass that always points north. Yes. Otherwise we are always pulled to our limp. And so if you limp towards a week, a feat version of masculinity, then you're going to end up there with a woke version of a masculinity. If you limp the other direction, then you're going to end up with this toxic, you know, men dominate women version of masculinity, neither of which is biblically appropriate. And, and part of it is there's not like, there's not a biblical masculinity as in there's not a chapter on masculinity in the Bible, right? Well, we have our expressions of masculinity that are appropriate or not appropriate biblically. And the Bible teaches that as a discipleship thing. Um, and then if you're a man and you're a disciple, this should look like this, not the other way around. So this is a, and I feel like there are great stories that teaches that in the Bible. There's direct teaching that teaches us that in the Bible that we can have some fun conversations with. Um, but as we talked about, there's a, the, the, the how we're less version of masculinity is not biblically sound. The, um, dominating version of masculinity is also not biblically sound. And so there's, there are healthy, um, healthy, strong versions of masculinity that are biblically sound in the same way that that's true of femininity. There's, there are, there are, there's ways to get outside of the rails on femininity as well. And just because like you're saying, there's ways to get outside of the rails on any thing that is cultural pick any cultural thing. And there's always the world will always take it one, it'll take it well to quote, like what, what Moses still is to Joshua don't turn to the right or the left. And that's all that that's just a model, a model that we as moral people understand, there's always going to be a, you're, you're walking the line of morality. There's always going to be at least two directions to fall. And that doesn't mean politically right or left, although that can apply to, it just means there's always going to be ways to fall off of God's plan and God's strategy and his morality. And, and the culture is always going to do that. And our bent is going to be to do that too. So if only the Megiddo mosaic had a section on it, like it seems that they dignified or women were dignified. Yes. If only there was a section of that, that talked about masculinity, that would have been nice. Yes. Maybe that maybe we'll uncover that next time. Maybe next time. Exactly. We'll discover, we'll discover Jesus's response to our masculinity issues in our culture today. Set in stone. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Well, thank you guys so much. Bryn, did you have anything else to add to that conversation there? No. I mean, I feel like we've talked a lot about it in the past and there's things we could talk about, but that's. Yeah.
