This is Chris Legg and I want to bring a kind of a special little mini session here to our conversation because I know probably plenty of you who wrestle with the deconstruction of faith and the reconstruction of faith are really struggling hearing about the recent report that came out of the Southern Baptist Convention. And one of the things we were talking about with the group as we were recording our podcast today was looking at how the Bible does not shy away from these conversations. I mean, we get the ugliest picture of Samson possible or maybe some of that like Jacob in the Bible. I mean, we get just ugly versions of them and leaders included like King David, who is everyone's hero and yet, man, the stuff he got into and the ugliness that created and the consequences that he paid and all of that is there. Even New Testament people like the Apostle Peter, we get to see them sink, we get to see them fail and we even get to see them deny their Lord. And so we see Paul struggle with sin in his life and the flesh. So it just makes no sense to me when we discover that a population of Christians have worked hard to cover up sin. It makes no sense to me. It's biblically unsound. It's not a part of our religion. It isn't how Jesus taught. In fact, in multiple places, Jesus taught about how significant it is that we protect children and bring them to him. He even gets pretty worked up at some point and says it would be better for someone to tie a millstone around their neck. And I've seen millstones in Israel. They're huge. They're bigger than car wheels in America made out of solid stone and the thought of tying one of those around your neck and throwing yourself into the sea. He says it'd be better to do that than to keep a child or to cause a child to fall and to stumble. And so I haven't got to read the whole report yet, but I know I'm familiar with some of the basics that are coming out that there may be hundreds of examples of leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention covering up abuse of adults and children, even sexual abuse, all the different things. And I will say as a pastor and as a therapist, this is unconscionable to me. It is unbelievable and shocking, but I do believe it. I believe that it happened and I believe that it happens. And I'm just I am heartbroken and infuriated that it would be this way. I would love to encourage you if you're out there listening. Obviously, no one gets to speak for all the different churches in the world, much less a whole denomination. But I would love to invite you if you're curious about the church that produces this podcast, which is South Spring Baptist Church. You can actually go to our website and we have something at southspring.org slash connect. And then we have ministry guidelines and and on our ministry guidelines page, we have a little tab that says read so loved. And our so loved documentation is the expression of how we deal with these issues in our church and how we confront them and and and what we do to protect children and to even to come alongside registered sex offenders and how we handle those type of situations. We do not at South Spring shy away from these conversations. And we believe that's biblically sound to not shy away from them. And so we serve a God of truth. And so if you're covering up truth, you're apparently not serving him very well. And so I'd love to really encourage you as you face this and as you're challenged by this, especially those of you who have experienced abuse one way or another at the hands of people in the name of Christ or in a church. Wow, I am I am super sorry that you've had to face that. And it's again, infuriating and heartbreaking that that's the case. And I know that that is the case for so, so many out there. So I'd love to comfort you and encourage you and pray for you. And and and as you figure out how you're going to engage with these conversations, we'll come back to this at some point for sure and probably do a whole podcast over the next couple of months as the Southern Baptist Convention meets and to see what they do with it. But we know that these are huge barriers to people's faith. That is a very real and serious problem that when Christian leaders make bad decisions, when they cover for their crimes, when they refuse to speak the truth, when they abuse staff members, when they are unkind and and abusive and domineering and and all the different things that come with that sometimes. And and God forbid that ever be the case here. It seems so easy for some people to follow Christ because it seems to work so well for them and especially when people will cover up your sin in the name of Christ in the name of the church. Wow, that that is just not it's completely not OK. It is dandable at every level. So anyway, I'm I'm sorry. Many people are probably being triggered by this and having to face this conversation. Again, my encouragement to you is which is always the case here on reconstructed faith. We're never going to encourage you to build your faith on people or organizations of people. We need to deconstruct our faith in people. We are going to fail you. All of us fail one another all the time. Our faith is not in one another. It'd be great if we could. And when we can, that's fun. And when we can have friendship and trust, that's great. And we try to create a healthy, trustworthy church here and many others do as well. But when we hear about the failure of human beings to follow through with what they proclaim and nothing, very few things are more infuriating that especially involves abusive people and especially the abuse of women and children and others who are victimized in this, it is not OK in any way. And we would love for it to help you get help if you need to get help working through some of that. So instead, we deconstruct our faith and others. We deconstruct our faith and the false things about God and instead build our faith on the truth of who he is and who he reveals himself to be in his scripture. And his scripture would certainly indicate that he is in no way OK with this. Not OK. This is not the way it's supposed to be. So anyway, just just wanted to send out a quick word to you guys out there. We appreciate you for listening. And I hope you will even as you are having to change and deconstruct and grieve and hurt that you'll get the help that you need, whatever that is, and that you'll keep listening, keep pushing, keep fighting, keep struggling. We're all right there with you. And and we really do appreciate you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.72, "text": " Okay, hey, reconstructed faith.", "tokens": [50363, 16805, 11, 17207, 11, 49594, 4562, 13,
