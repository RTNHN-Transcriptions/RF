We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined as always by my partners in crime, Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. Guys, we're back having a conversation today, sort of starting off our conversation from a listener question and then going into some conversations about reason of Brynn and her husband having some conversations with friends or people that I kind of call into question some, I think valuable things to clarify. And so I'll just, I'll talk, I guess first thing, what I'll do is I'll just write the question. Caitlin Baker writes, I'm wondering what everyone's thoughts are on universalism. It's not a belief I hold, but I know it actually quite a common, like she knows it's a common belief. Sorry. What are your guys educated opinions on the topic? My first thing is thank you for assuming that we are educated on the topic. Mainly me, mainly me. That's awesome. Yes. But then the other side of things is when we were talking about this very briefly before, it's like, oh yeah, well, we can definitely address this. I was like, what is universalism? Anyway, so what did you learn when you, when you Googled? Well, my first Google search result was it's a philosophical and theological concept that some ideas have universal application or applicability. I was like, okay. That's not what she's asking. That's not what she's asking. Right. What she's asking is basically like universally are people like reconciled. There you go. You know, there's good word. Do you like, are there applicable ideas? Oh, sorry. That was my question is like, for you, Chris, if she's thinking about it along the lines of universal reconciliation, that everyone is saved, ultimately we are all going to go to heaven. Is that, is that, is that what you think she's probably getting at? Yes. Yes. I think so. So then my, my question is, is this something that it's like, Oh, well, Bryn, you talk about what you said regarding universalism. Do you remember what you said before? I'm doing a bad job of moderating this conversation. You're doing fine. You're doing fine right now. So listeners, you're like, wait, what? Hey, don't look confused. It's not just you. Colson is also I am there. Remember I'm not the educated one. These guys are so you are educated. So what do you say? So wait, you had said, Bryn, that there was like the all truth is God truth concept. Yeah. So I think that, yeah, like Chris said, I don't think this is what she's asking, but I think you have to be careful. And I think it's important that we're defining it because when you read some of these descriptions, it's like, um, I have to pull up what exactly you had said. I think I have it. Um, some ideas have universal application or applicability. And I think there's a side of this of like, okay, if, if we're breaking down some of the definitions at face value, like, yes, that's not what universalism is as a whole, but we have talked about before how all truth is God's truth. Meaning that just because a worldview is incorrect doesn't mean they have no, they have no beliefs that are true at all. And, and, and so I think there is an aspect of this that's not the primary tenet of universalism, but there is an aspect that's true and that, yeah, I think there are things that are true across the board because there, God is the creator of truth. Um, maybe you can clarify this more, Chris, but when I was reading that, that was like kind of the first thing I thought of we can dig into the deeper aspects of it, but that's kind of one of the aspects I was like, well, in that case, in that sense, excuse me, we would believe that of like, okay, yes, there are some truths that translate in all situations because God is author of truth. And even if the rest of the situation isn't, that still holds true. Okay. Yeah. This is a question of absolutely. Yeah. You get what you guys are saying makes total sense. And that is something that we would say if something is true, which is the way we would need to say it. If something is true, all truth statements are not equal. All statements of truth are equal. So people say stuff all the time and claim it's true. That does not make it true. Right. And so, and so, yeah, so that's a, people say things are true all the time that aren't true. Now that being this case, if something is true, it is universally true. It is true under all conditions. It is the truth. Now, again, you can make caveats for truth. Like I'm hungry right now. Well, that's a true statement that will, it will not be a true statement at some point in the future. Like this is a complex conversation, which is why our earliest podcasts, you know, whenever it was, we started this seven, eight years ago. I think it was actually more like two, right? But when you're listening to this, it can feel like it exactly. Is that we, is that, is that we, that's why we spent so much time talking about and defining truth and sources of truth and et cetera, because we have to be on the same page about that. Now that being said, moving back to the conversation, that however, is not what's being asked by the question of universalism. Universalism is a religious perspective that says, that makes the claim, all souls will be saved. All there is a God and that God will eventually, well, one way or another move everyone, everyone will be in heaven with that God. Does that make sense? That's the actual. And by that definition, I think a lot of people are universalists without claiming to universalism. Like I think a lot of people claim to that, that perspective. Yes. Now that being said, there are a couple of different ways that this plays out. And I want to clarify between them because I do think there is space for one of them in scripture. And I think that's our main question. I'm assuming that our co-listener is asking is what does the Bible say about this? Not necessarily what do we think about it, but what does the Bible actually say about this? And so I think that's where we want to jump in. And so what does the Bible say about this? Well, let's look at some, if you guys have got your Bibles handy, let's do some Bible drill here. But the basic idea, and I'll give you some verses, we'll look those up and then we will, then I'll comment a little more while y'all are looking. So I'm going to need Romans 5 starting in verse 12. You're going to get that one Colson. Oh, you got that one, Bryn. Okay. Let's also do 1 Timothy 2 starting in verse 4. Now, while y'all are looking those up, much and it won't take long, but let me just say the view that there is no judgment, that everyone just instantly you die, you go to heaven. Like everyone gets to go to heaven because heaven's a good place and God likes to make everybody go to a good place. And so everyone's going to go to heaven. That is not that there is no, the Bible, you can't defend that one biblically. You mean you have to ignore essentially everything in the Bible. And so you're, you're, I just, you know, you don't want to try to make that case. So that being, but, but the second one is, which some people believe even great thinkers like C.S. Lewis may have held to, is will all souls eventually end up in heaven? And that's a, that's a separate question. And so that's the one we're going to actually spend a little time discussing because there are people, and again, I'm not saying C.S. Lewis taught this, there are different opinions on what C.S. Lewis actually believed about this. And since he didn't ever write a Summa Theologica textbook, we're stuck reading a lot of his fiction, trying to figure out what he meant, you know, what did he mean by, why does he have the, the non-believing dwarves and others in, you know, the great, the last battle in the new heaven and new earth? Why does, you know, the further up further and why does he have the bad guys there too? Or why didn't the great divorce, do you have people getting on a bus and eventually ending up in heaven, even though they started in hell? So, and it's hard to know, like, what did he mean to teach by that? Well, it was fiction. So, all right. So, so that's the one we will look at and let's discuss some of that. So y'all ready? Let's start in Romans. Can I say one thing really quick before we jump into that? But I think we have covered in episodes, like, if the first question is something people are still wrestling with, like, how could a good God send people to hell? We have covered that before. So if that's kind of like, I know scripture says this, but I'm still struggling with that concept of like, why does a good God not send everyone to heaven? Right. I can't remember which episode. It may have been justice. Yeah, I don't know exactly either. But yes. Colson, you may remember, but we have covered that before. So we're not passing over it. If that's your specific question, we can go through and look up which episode it is specifically. But just if that's what people are wrestling with before we go on to the next one. That's a good point. Thank you, Bryn. Good reminder. Excellent. Okay, so let's look at a couple of passages. These are some of the ones that people look to to say that there is a universal perspective. So Romans chapter 5, if you'll start in verse 12 and start reading, if you will. Okay. Till verse, do you know? It'll be about 21, I think, 2021, if I remember correctly. Okay. Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, so death spread to all men because all sinned. For sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses ever, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. But the free gift is not like the trespass, for if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for many. And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin, for the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification in life for all men. For as by one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience, the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, verse 21, so that as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness, leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Okay, very good. You can see how that passage taken, just that passage, especially in the central part of it, around verse 16, it says when it talks about that the gift comes to all men, because of the work of one, is a, obviously that's a powerful argument, it's a good passage for looking at that. And while Colson is reading first, what I have to give you first, Timothy 2, um, jump on over to, uh, Brin, if you will, to Romans 11 32 and then first Timothy 2 4. So just 2 4? I think it's just 2 4. Um, that starts mid sentence. Feel free to go back then. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So in verse three, it says, this is good and is pleasing in the sight of God, our savior, verse four, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Okay. That's verse four. Okay. And then you'll look at 4 10 and verse Timothy as well. Brin, did you get 11 32? Mm hmm. What you got? Romans 11 32. Hold on. Okay. For God has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all. Okay. There you go. Mercy on all that he might have mercy on all. Okay. And then 4 10 on 10 first Timothy. Okay. It says for to this end, we toil and strive because we have our hopes set on the living God who is the savior of all people, especially of those who believe. Mm hmm. Interesting. Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah. Let me also read one more. Um, John 12 32. Um, Jesus says, um, actually, I'll start in verse 30. Jesus answered, this voice has come for your sake, not mine. Um, that's the, um, let's say in the middle of, let's say in John 12, Jesus talks, he's teaching and the voice from heaven comes out and says that it would, um, let's see, I have glorified it and I will glorify it again, talking about his own name. And then down to verse 30, this voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of the world. Now will the ruler of the world be cast out and I, when I am lifted up from the earth will draw all people to myself. So what stood out to you about those passages, um, in each, in each of those situations, what stood out to you? Those are, there are plenty of other like ones, but I consider those to be the, my opinion is those are the strongest. What do y'all think? I mean, I, I can see, I can see where if you just, if you're just trying to prove a point and you pull these scriptures, that there is a case that you can make from just pulling scriptures, right? Prove texting, I guess is what I mean. Okay. That's certainly always a risk, right? Okay. I mean, it seems like there are a few verses that could mean that, but in context it still seems hard to, to make the case. Um, which I guess is kind of what Colson's saying, pulling them out of context, but I mean, yeah, I don't know. Okay. So this is a, there, there is a conversation that goes on that these create, and I think rightfully so that, so when you have phrases like that God desires that all people come to the truth, um, or it is God's will that any, everyone would be saved or that all would be saved or that he is the savior of all people, especially, especially those who believe that interesting. Okay. Okay. That, that is yeah, an interesting qualifier. So he is the, so those, most of those give us insight into God's character. Yeah. Um, and, and I do think, by the way, if we were having a deeper theological conversation about limited atonement, these passages are very damaging to the, if those are out there who are, that's a conversation that wants, you want to get into an in-depth conversation about Calvinism versus, um, Armenianism and all that kind of stuff. And we may have even had a podcast where we talked about it. It's not a huge issue for deconstruction. I don't think, but, um, if it is, then you're deconstructing at a very deep level. Um, but anyway, that's nothing is great. The idea that he would have mercy on all the desires for all people to come to the truth, the savior of all people, these are statements about his character or about his identity. These are who he are, who he is, who he are, um, who he is. I mean, exactly who we are. That is actually not for a try. You guys. Um, and so I think, I think when you take Romans, which is still about Romans. Yeah, exactly. They're the best. Um, when you're looking at the book of Romans, and I would just tell anyone out there, you always have to be careful taking a section of Romans just out and analyzing it by itself. Um, because Romans is a linear argument and their cases being laid upon cases being laid upon cases all the way to the end. I think anyone would be really hard pressed to argue that the book of Romans as a whole teaches the idea that, that, um, even just Romans five, that, that this is a like this, that it teaches universalism as in everyone ends up in heaven someday. However, I think passages like this, and what we do know about the character of God, that he has desires for all people to come to the truth, that he wants to have mercy. He does have mercy on all that he does desire that everyone would come to know him. I think those are part of the valid case that someone can make and say, I really come to the conclusion that, that everyone someday ends up with him, that all humans someday end up with him. I would, and I will tell you personally, I would love for that to be the truth. I don't know that I, and I think so what the way I tell people is, I think that it is a, um, that it is biblically that the, the argued argument towards eventual universalism can be biblically sound though. I do not think it's biblically strong. Um, I think there's a much stronger case, um, that human beings are more likely many human beings, if not all human beings, not all, sorry, if not all who go to are condemned and go to hell, stay there forever. Um, I think, I think there's a stronger case that direction probably bits just pure biblically, but I don't, I think we're still left with the room for, um, do human beings eventually get judged, pay a price of some type in, in some form of hell, and then eventually pay off that debt somehow in their own punishment and then somehow end up someday in heaven. Um, I think you can make the case. I think it's a great case to make. If somebody wants to make that, um, I would never want to rely on that. Okay. But clarifying question about that, is it that they're paying off their debt or is it that they are allowed to reconsider? Because I think that seems more dialogically sound to me of like, they're allowed to reconsider other than they're paying off their debt because that doesn't seem in line with scripture, right? Well, it's a debt. It's a debt that no one could, the idea that they're, that the debt that we owe is a debt we cannot pay no matter how much we suffered for that. It is possible. Um, though God could set a timer, it would be God's option to say, okay, we've judged you, I've condemned you for your sins. Your, your punishment is 5,000 years. Like he would be setting that it would be God's justice setting that number, whatever that is. And he would be the one who delineates it's this long. This is how long you're separated, um, from my goodness and you have to experience my wrath and then I will welcome you back. Um, I agree. Another thing that would be a plausible opportunity would be that, you know, CS Lewis is, is very literary, which is no, you can enter heaven anytime you actually choose to have your own free will. It's just that most people don't ever do it. Um, because it's too painful to accept the truth or yeah, or because they're so afraid of being taken advantage of like the last battle. And so, um, I think, I think how that would work now, we're really making stuff up because we just have nothing. Like what would be the, what would be the operations by which God would welcome someone who had been condemned back into some kind of justification with him? I, I, we have no clue into the Bible gets to get, because the, the preponderance of the evidence one is that, for example, hell is an eternal place. That's not even really open to debate either. The question is are human beings ever, are any human beings there forever? And that's the only real debate I think people can have. And it's largely from silence. So let's look at some of the passages that would indicate that, that there is a, um, such a thing as an eternal hell and that, and that people may be there forever. And you'll again, you'll see, okay, it certainly says some of this, but is it absolutely clear on the other? Let's look. So if you'll get, uh, uh, brain, if you'll get Matthew 25 starting in verse 31 and, uh, Colson, but if you grab Romans chapter two, starting in verse six, 25 31 starting verse 31 probably through about 45 46 somewhere around there. I keep getting the really long passages. Colson. That's right. Thank you. That's right. Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. Okay. When the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne before him will be gathered all the nations and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats and he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left. Then the King will say to those on his right, come you who are blessed by my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer him saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothed you? And when did we see you sick or in prison or in visit you? And the King will answer them, truly I say to you, as you did to the least of these, my brothers, you did to me. Then you will say to those on the left, apart from me, you cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink. I was a stranger and you did not welcome me naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they will also answer saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you? Then he will answer them saying, truly I say to you, as you did not do to one of the least of these, you did not do unto me, did not, sorry, did not do it to me. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. Okay. Man, thank you. One, thank you. You have a great reading. Oh, well thank you. Thank you. Okay. So we'll keep going, but obviously you can hear the tone of that one does not make it seem like. Yeah. Eternality for sure. Yeah. Okay. For all. Okay. So I think I said Romans two. Romans. Oh, gotcha. Romans two starting in which verse? Uh, six. Okay. And you just stopped me. Okay. About 16. I think it's about 16. Great. He will render to each one according to his works, to those who by patience and well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, they will, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek for God shows no partiality for all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. For when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when according to my gospel God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus. Very word of God. Okay, pretty strong judgment language going on there, right? In Romans. That's other things. Right there. That's exactly right. Right there in Romans. I'm going to read John 3 16. You may have heard of that one through 18. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish without eternal life. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned. Whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of God. There you go. Um, we could also look at real quick. I will. I'll jump on some of these Mark 9 44. Um, and if your right hand causes you to send, cut it off is better if you to enter life crippled than with two hands than to go to hell to the unquenchable fire. Um, so again, the con this, you can see why the question do Christians in do humans end up in hell is, is really not a viable argument to say they never get there. They never face judgment. Um, instead to recognize, no, this, this does happen. People do face judgment. There are a time and judgment when human beings do end up in hell. The only thing that I think is open to conversation based on these passages we looked at is could there be a day when humans are able to be rescued from hell? And that's the thing from silence. That's argument from silence. It is like largely from silence. Yeah, we looked at the passages that that seem to, it seems to indicate that there is some type of universal salvation. Um, and if that's the case, what form would that take? And the only, in my opinion, the only case you can even make is that somehow someday God will offer to redeem or will offer some type of end to the judgment of those who are condemned. Now, I would say you have absolutely no confidence of that. We have a very clear plan of salvation, a trustworthy plan of salvation, um, through what, what, um, Christ gave us and what is all through Roman. Like the whole point of Romans is to teach us that Jesus Christ has a salvation and he has a gospel and it's the good news through him. Is there some way somehow that his good news could be applied even to those who go to hell and are condemned? I guess, sure. That's God's prerogative. Um, but the problem with universalism teaching is it seems to imply some kind of confidence in that. Like I am sure that my interpretation of God's justice or my interpretation of God's love is the right one. And therefore you don't need to worry about it. Someday loving, just God will let you into his heaven, right? Like, or your understanding of love, justice, and mercy is wrong. Yeah. And man, I would never want to risk the idea of, well, I told you to put confidence in my understanding of mercy and justice and love. And it turns out I misunderstood those. So the confidence needs to come in putting our faith in Jesus Christ to save us forever. And that I think we can have great confidence as Jesus taught the, there is a wide path that leads to destruction and there's a narrow path that leads to life. Jesus seems to spend a lot of time warning us off that wide path to destruction. If it turns out it's just not a big deal if we take it. And so I think Jesus and the apostle Paul and the other writers of the new Testament are very clear. You don't want to end up in God's wrath, even for a second, much less for eternity. And at best, you're risking eternity to say my way is better. Um, which again, I don't understand it's a free gift, so why not accept it anyway? But, um, uh, I mean, all the other things we've talked about, I don't mean to minimize, I know that it can be hard to accept God and, and all the things that come and all the things that come with that. And that sometimes seem irrational or unfair or something to us. But, uh, yeah, I think universalism again, so to summarize universalism has a case to make, um, that is potentially sound. Um, but I think it's, um, I don't think you can make any confidence in it whatsoever. Well, then what, and then what would you say to, to Brynn's point about, um, Christians still using reason and how would you pull that in to this universalism concept? Well, I think that's part of this is you can, one of the issues that we run into, um, and maybe this will, we'll need to unpack it further next time or another time, is that Christians often dismiss reason. Um, like I think a lot of pastors would probably, or a lot of the pastors I grew up with, some of them would have immediately said like, no, since the Bible doesn't say it's universal, it isn't. And I'm going, I mean, I make it, you can make a case, I guess, like I want to be open to the rational side of this conversation when the Bible is not say absolutely no, never, never. It does say that the only way is through Christ, but it also says that God applies His mercy on whom He applies His mercy. And that, that opens up a door for us that it could be for even those who He has condemned, that there's another way for Him to assign that mercy later, especially when we look at passages like the ones we looked at, they go like, Hmm, okay. Okay, maybe. Um, but also it's not the same as saying all roads lead to God, you know? Oh gosh, yeah. So that's not, that is, that's not really something that's open biblically. Again, people might want to make that case, but it's not biblically sound. And so that's why we, we look to scripture first for confidence. Um, then we can discuss the idea going back to that original conversation of all truth being God's truth. So whether it's medical truth or psychological truth or mathematical truth, like if it's the truth, God agrees with it. No matter who it is, who, which human states it. Um, and so obviously in my world as a psychologist, one of my areas, um, I don't know how many thousands of times over the years I've said, if Sigmund Freud says something that's true, the fact that he's Sigmund Freud doesn't make it untrue. Like the fact that he's a, you know, probably a multi-level addict who ran no experiments, but made all types of experimental conclusions, like he's a terrible person to, to trust in for almost anything. But if he says two plus two is four, it's still four, even though Freud's the one who said it. Um, if Freud says a lie, it's a, if our falsehood, it's a falsehood. If he says a truth, it's a truth. And if Freud came up with something that no one before him had come up with, meaning, you know, and I don't know that he did, but if he said something that it was a true statement that is true, it's still true because all truth is God's truth. God is the ultimate source of all truth. Um, and so that's true. That's true about psychology and it's true about reason and rationality. And if we reach a true conclusion, then it's still true. No, really, no matter how we got there, that's one of the weird things is even if we got there the wrong way, if we still come to the right answer, it's still the right answer. Um, which is a funky way that God created the universe is that the truth gets to be the truth no matter what we think about it, whether we know it, like it, believe it, or agree with it, it's still the truth. Um, and if it is the truth, then it is the truth, whether it's found in scripture or whether it's uncovered through empirical evidence or whether it's uncovered from rationality, um, or whatever. So Ren, where would you go with that? Yeah, I think we may not have enough time to, like you're saying, to unpack all of it, but I think that's a valuable conversation. Just, I mean, for our whole goal for this podcast, one, but, um, also just for Christians to understand it's, yeah, you do have to, to navigate it with discernment because we do believe that scripture is the foundation where we go back to, but that doesn't mean that God doesn't use and, and we, we don't believe that, you know, scripture is incomplete in revelate, you know, that type of conversation of scripture somehow incomplete in what God's provided for us. But we also believe that God has used, um, you know, humans in his work to provide good gifts to each other, to help each other in our spiritual walk. And like, I think a lot of that is part of this conversation of why is it the conversation that we, that prompted this was why is it okay to use reason, um, when tackling a lot of these hard things and not just say, well, if scripture doesn't blatantly say something, then we're not going to dig into it any further. Um, and I think that's a valuable question for Christians to answer because a lot of what we do on this podcast is using scripture as our foundation for truth, but also digging into reason and logic and psychology. And we don't believe that those things are somehow opposed to each other, but then it's another avenue that God has given us to a discover the truth that he's revealed, but also to encourage each other in walking that path of like discovering truth. So psychology, you know, Chris being an expert in psychology, and that doesn't mean that he is a psychologist. And then over here, he believes in, you know, the truth of scripture. Yeah. I don't have multiple personalities when it comes to that. Right. But I think this is a important thing for Christians to wrestle with. Can we use our minds? Does God even biblically, and this is the part we may want to dig into later, but biblically, does God even encourage us to use our minds and logic and reason when it comes to discovering truth about him and reading scripture and, uh, engaging with our world? That's great. I don't know if that's a good summary, but yeah, that is, I think we, I think we've said many times that, you know, if, if the Bible is infallible as a source of truth, but if, so if our understanding of scripture seems to come in conflict with our understanding of another source of information, like scientific knowledge or, or reason, then that just means that our understanding of at least one of them is wrong. It doesn't mean scripture is wrong, but our understanding of scripture can be wrong. And it could mean our reason is wrong. It could mean our scientific understanding is wrong. Our intuition is wrong. Um, scripture is infallible. It won't be wrong, but our understanding of it certainly can be because we're fallible, even though it isn't. And so we looked at it for an infallible source, knowing that we're, we are fallible receptors. And so yeah, we, we wrestle through them when they do seem to conflict, that tells us there's a problem. Um, and we have to continue to dig until truth aligns. And that's what we look for. So great stuff. Good conversation. Thanks guys. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.
