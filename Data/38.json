We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner in the studio today with my partners in crime, Chris Legg who's here and Chris Sherrod who is joining us via Zoom. How are you guys doing? Doing good. Great. Wonderful. Happy to be here. Hey man, so glad that you're here. I'm going to throw it over to Chris Legg who's going to kind of catch us up reminding us what we were talking about with hermeneutics and then we're going to continue that conversation. So take it away, Chris Legg. Well to catch up Chris, since you weren't able to be on the last one, so Bryn and Colson and I were discussing some of the things about hermeneutics, the art and science of studying revelation from God. And so for those who are listening, this will be a little bit of a reminder. So we talked about how revelation being one of the sources of knowledge, you and I did the podcast way back on epistemology and sources of truth and all that. And so, you know, the same way that we need rules and guidelines, the scientific method in order to uncover empirical evidence with any level of confidence, the same way we need the laws of logic in order to let reason unpack truth for us. We need rules, guidelines for studying revelation and for how to dig into it and how it's that important that we need to have proper ways of doing it. So it's like a scientist just throwing together some kind of research project without any idea of the guidelines for how that's done well. And so we even really unpacked and you can listen to it obviously, the kind of the role of the Holy Spirit in that and how people sometimes test God with that versus trusting Him in that. And it's good to trust the Spirit, but God tells us not to test Him and that's different. And then we dove into the kind of, and I know there's a thousand ways to do this and you may use other words. I do the observe, interpret and apply. There's lots of different, usually three or four word little patterns like that. Do you use a different one when you're teaching it, Chris? No, I think anything just like that is I'm trying to think of it, did something different because you're just asking what is it saying? What does it mean and how does it apply? But yeah, right. Yeah. Those are the basic ideas. So we were in observation and we actually practiced with the feeding of the 5,000 and I kind of wanted them to see that it's not just that, Hey, do you make good use of good hermeneutics so you don't do something wrong. But also when you practice good hermeneutics, there's a treasure. There are treasures to be discovered that you can't really find any other way. And so I don't know if you've ever seen the way the feeding of the 5,000 and Mark mirrors the 23rd Psalm, but that's an example of like when you do good hermeneutics, you uncover stuff treasures like this that you're like, that is so cool. And you kind of freak out when you see it. And it's part of why we do Israel trips and study history is so that we understand the context really well. But one of the things we need to talk about is for sure is under observation is genre is what kind of literature you're looking at. And so I know you've talked about that and talked about that some, could you unpack that a little bit maybe as a starting point? I mean, I think that's great, especially because you know, you have people say, well, I don't understand the Bible or they pull things out of out of context. Like, well, what did he mean by, you know, facial hair and all that, you know, like, and I think people can and do lump everything together as one genre or it's just where it's a lot more complicated than that, as we know. But I think it's valuable for us to hear that. Yeah. Well, I can't get any better than Chris's illustration he used already about his wife's love letter. Oh, yeah. On the counter that has milk and eggs and cheese and butter from the story. It's just one of those things where you mentioned this already before that the Bible is. It's not written, it's it's for us, but it's not written to us. Yeah. And again, I know you already talked about that, but if I don't if I don't understand that it's like me in my illustration before was being in a bookstore and I don't know what section of the store I'm in and I pick up something that I think is historical, but I'm in the science fiction section. I want to be really confused or I'm looking for poetry, but I'm reading I'm in the mechanics books on how to fix your car section. So it is actually part of the whole context that we've talked about already. The importance of that, because if you're reading a parable, you interpret a parable, you read a parable different than you read history. If I'm reading prophecy, I'm going to read it differently than I'm reading, you know, a psalm or something like that. So it just overall is going to be really confusing for you and you're probably going to misinterpret stuff. If you don't understand either the culture or what was being said there or what was maybe an idiom, like there's all of this stuff that you got to research. And I just think people a lot of times were just lazy and we just want the immediate answer fed to us without having taken the time to read. Do we understand how they were thinking back then? Right. Like when we had David Smalley and you pointed out like that description was sufficient for someone back in Moses Day. It wouldn't be for us. It would bug us today. All the details maybe were left out. But right. It's just a different way of saying things. And then I think I used this analogy before, but if I told my grandma, I'm going to go surf the web, her brain would have been thinking of surfing and she would have pictured a big web. And she would have been exactly like what in the world because her job for spiders. Right. Right. Right. It's just you got to go like, okay, what did they mean then? I'm like, even Jesus saying three days and three nights, the son of a man will be in the like Jonah was. Yeah. You start to go, wait, he wasn't three full days and three full nights, but then you start going, okay, but an idiom of the time. Yeah. You know, would help you explain that. But anyways. Yeah. That's really good thoughts. The just to make sure in case somebody hasn't heard it, because it may have been a while back, the analogy that I often use is if I come home and find a love note from my wife, I love poem from my wife and it like Chris was saying, it says eggs and cheese and sandwich meat and toilet paper. And and I and I start trying to every every interpretation I make and every application I make based on the belief that that's a love letter is going to be wrong because it's not a love letter. It's a grocery list. It doesn't matter how good, how creative or how imaginative my engagement with that is or how sincere or great point or how sincere, how dedicated I am to taking it literally, how dedicated that I am to taking it seriously. If I have the wrong genre, most of my and most of my application interpretation, if not all of it, is going to be bad. And so Ginger will be Matt. My wife's going to be frustrated at me one because I didn't get any of those things at the store. And because what I'm trying to I have no idea how to try to apply those things to our romantic life. But the that's a that would be all totally off. And so when you're reading and to make things more difficult when it comes to Scripture is we don't always know what genre of literature the author intended. And there are even genres of literature that they had that we we have really kind of lost the practice of using very much. Really? And so we don't we don't think in terms of poetic literature that much. We don't write long stories based on historical events put in poetic form. And the closest thing we have to that is like, you know, like a song like the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald or something like that, where you have this long lyrical poem about a historical event. But you got to make it rhyme and the lyrics have got to work. So you leave things out and you add things in to make it rhyme and you and you go, wait, but that's not OK, but wait, technically, that's that's not the right word that you would use. Well, OK, but it is what happened. I'm just using poetic language. And and we're not we don't do a lot of that anymore. The West doesn't like that much anymore. We don't like the idea of revealing truth without revealing fact in exactly the same format. And and yet for the for the Middle Eastern mind, even today, for Middle Eastern thinking, that is much more acceptable. And it certainly was two thousand years ago. You mean like Hotel California didn't really happen? The same. We'll talk later. Yeah, that's up to that's up to interpretation. Yes, exactly. Thank you. That's exactly the point. That's exactly the point. I have always tried to find that place. And I thought, why why would you want to find that place? To free all the people. It sounds terrible to free the people. OK, there you go. All right. Sorry. Sorry for questioning your motives there. But that's that is huge. And you can see why that's challenging, especially when we don't know for sure. So when you're reading, you know, wisdom, literature or poetic literature like Job or like Psalm or like or wisdom, like proverbs or Ecclesiastes, man, I've seen people getting so much trouble with Ecclesiastes because they take every line in Ecclesiastes as though it's a statement. Every single line is a statement of truth. And it just isn't. That's not a correct way to read that like it. And what do you what do you mean by that? It's like it's it's true. And there are truths revealed in it or the Book of Proverbs, both proverbs and the Please Ask The More like guidelines. Partly. I mean, it's it's generally true, but it doesn't guarantee that if you train up a child in the way you should go, you want to depart from his face. Right. Right. That's exactly right. And so you did. That's not a guarantee. It's not a promise. And and so even so, it's tough for us, especially as Westerners, is we want everything to be textbook formatted, meaning the same word means the same thing in all conditions. And that is not the thinking. And and so, for example, one of the great research is that one of the great things that's going on right now in a lot of Christian, serious Christian hermeneutics is is the question of is there such a thing as mytho history, meaning true history told in the language of myth. And the closest thing we have to that in here in the West that we use periodically is sometimes just straight fiction or when you tell a narrative in a dramatic way. So like when you were, let's say if you said, you know, there was an event that happened and then we're going to make a play out of it. So say like Hamilton was the one I was trying to think of like Hamilton. OK, so it's a perfect example of mytho history. It's historical. These things kind of happened, but we're using mythical language to describe it. And and we're using mythical pictures. These people weren't there. And this type of person wasn't there or this that no one sung this song probably in that. We're assuming they weren't jumping, doing nearly as much dancing and singing during these historical events as they do. And so but but what's amazing is there are things about history that people are learning from Hamilton that they had never learned in any other way. So it isn't that there isn't truth to be revealed, but it does mean you can't just be a lazy bystander who just goes, well, all of that, that must be just kind of like somebody videoed the founding fathers. That must be what that's like. It's not like that. Yeah. And so mytho history would be the similar to saying the truth revealed by a painting versus the truth revealed by a photograph. And so we struggle. I struggle with that. I'm not when I say we I'm including me too. I'm very Western in my thinking. And I really don't like the idea that something may be described and I could go back in time and watch it and go, oh, yeah, I recognize that. That's not exactly the way it was described, but I recognize that's what they were describing, if that makes sense. And so it's one of the things that people are really wrestling through with like the book of Job or some of the early the oldest stuff in Genesis, the Tower of Babel, the flood, and because the language is so similar to mythological language from that time period, but it's describing a historical event in the language of the time, and often probably meant to correct mythical errors from that time and to make them more historically true. Does that make them more historically specific or detailed or or historical? I don't I don't know. And that's uncomfortable for us. It's really tough for us. And so sometimes we don't know did Moses mean for us to read the parts of Genesis, for example, when Moses wasn't there, which is essentially the entire book of Genesis, right? Moses wasn't there for any of that. So he's writing something that's been revealed to him, either passed down through history or revealed directly from God. And what language, what genre is that exactly? Is it history? Like, is this a specific description of how it happened? Or is it meant to be a different form of literature than just pure history? And and that's where people get frustrated and angry and mad is it isn't that you're not taking it literally, it's that you're taking it literally according to the type of genre of literature you think it is. And then that's what you have to defend. Well, why do you think it's this versus this? And so anyway, it's it's it's challenging, especially in certain passages. Now, luckily, it gets a whole lot easier when you get to the New Testament, a whole lot easier, because those are much more cut and dried genres of speech. And that's our genres of literature. I would say also that that people might use that. I just want to clarify. People you can use that an excuse for throwing out stuff that is clear. No, absolutely not. I would say the majority of stuff that we read, it's like, I think it's pretty much sense, like what God says about, you know, marriage or yes, faithfulness or sex or whatever. It's like, it's not metaphorical. But there's that phrase. I don't know if you said here if the plain sense makes perfect sense, seeing other sense. You just read it and there's times where there's anthropomorphism, which means you're ascribing human qualities to God like God saw God smelled God went down, right? God looked as if he didn't already know or whatever. But that helps us relate to him a little bit more. But I think for a lot of people, it's even funny that we've said this before, but there are phrases we use all the time that you don't take literally. It's like I read the Bible normally. I think you talked about this a couple weeks ago. Yes, I just read the Bible normally, which means when it's obviously, if I said I asked for my wife's hand in marriage, everyone knows what I mean. I want the rest of her to or, you know, all that stuff that we just use. I've thought about you every moment since I it's like, no, you haven't thought about it. You did not. Right. Exactly. But we know what it means. Even though it's not literal. It's raining cats and dogs. Exactly. Right. Yeah. So like, you know, similes and like, or ads and metaphors and stuff like that. I think it's funny that we actually now in today's English use the word literally to mean the opposite of literally. Right. That it's that it's we even so even we talk about discussing things. Do I study the Bible Bible literally? Like, I literally never put my Bible down. Right. I don't. Right. And yes, yes, you do. You don't know. I know that's the point I'm making. Like, but you said literally, it's funny that that word now we have we now use it to mean the opposite of the actual you mean you figuratively never put your Bible down. Yeah. Right. But there are figures of speaking the guy with the word literally in it because I was his big pet peeve. He shared on stage was like, everyone uses our lures. So we put it in his name. So it had to be part of his name. So cool. And Chris is referring to at Pankov. They named people names, names, names, names, and apparently cruelly mean. Oh, man, there are there's some rough stories over the years. Anyway, that's a so that's one. And that's just that's part of observation is what what genre of literature am I reading? And that's part of like, when you sit down with a passage, you should know that before you read it. You need to know before you read it. Is this narrative like the gospels are the gospels are narrative history. They're not necessarily like a history textbook. They are a first century Jewish narrative history with Greek influences. And that's that's even even that's a simplification. But to recognize that that's the case, and it's okay to read it. You don't have to know all of that. As we showed, you can read the story, the feeding of the 5000 and just absolutely love it and get it. And then there's a whole other level. And my guess is there's levels I don't even begin to understand that are there. If I could if I could do the Greek, like some of my professors could as fast as I read it, then that would be a man. I'm sure there are depths that they're able to get that I don't get. It doesn't mean I can't get it. It just means it's something special. But it but it's an also a really unique thing to the Bible in that it's like, it's designed in a way that to have repeating patterns and links and stuff like that. That's right. And so yeah, there's there's crazy depth to it. Yep. I didn't hear you guys talked about it. But I think the importance of it too, is when, like when Paul says to Timothy, study to show yourself approved. That implies there's some work involved. It's not just right to read and there's no big deal. Like you need to study or and then there's the the whole factor of the Holy Spirit as you read. But it's where Paul even said to him, think over what I'm saying. And the Lord will give you insight into it. It's like you do both. Like, they're not totally rely on the Holy Spirit. She's getting me whatever meaning. But it's not just totally me. I'm praying for yes, for discernment. Did you guys talk about the word exegesis? Did you use all that we used it? We could we could define it again, probably. Yes, because we have we have in other episodes. I think it's worth the revisiting. We did discuss the fact that trusting in the Holy Spirit and using good hermeneutical technique are not oppositional thoughts. And people who say, well, you don't need her, just because you have the Holy Spirit would be just as wrong as saying, I don't need the Holy Spirit because I have hermeneutics. Both of those would be in error. And it's silly that we try to pit them against each other. But go ahead, go ahead and describe exegesis and isegesis for our. Oh, yeah. So while X is where we either exit or exit, it just means has to do with the word out. And so exegesis is you're drawing out the author's intended meaning. And so to do that, you've got to know the context. You need to know the genre. You need to look at what's who's doing the speaking and all the verses around it. Otherwise, and we just do this naturally. If you walk up to a group of friends who are talking about something or even laughing about something, your first question is, what are you guys talking about? Yeah. If you just open any book randomly to the middle, you'd be confused because you don't know what it's going on. So you got to know what's you got to study a little bit to figure out, OK, who's talking or what are they talking about? So the opposite of that is isegesis, which is where you are reading your own meaning into the text to make it say either what you want it to say or, yeah, if you have a preconceived idea of what you what you're hoping it'll say. Or again, if you just don't even know the context, I think I'd use this example before, but apparently it was true. A guy who was praying about asking a girl out and he read a Bible verse that he thought the Lord had given him. And the verse was grace to you or grace be to you. Oh, no. And the girl's name was Grace. Seriously, like he really did. He was like, I got a word, my Lord, I'm going to claim that verse and confirmation. So did he marry her? I don't know the rest of it, but I just know that was the what's funny is I was thinking usually Paul says grace and peace. So I know that's actually got also. Wow. But it just goes along with what Paul said to the Corinthians in one place in Second Corinthians chapter two, he said we are not peddlers of God's word. Yeah, like we don't just take it and peddle it to make something off of it or to, you know, boast up ourselves. And then in in chapter four, he says we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word. But by the open statement of the truth, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience. So his point was we're not going to twist God's word. We're not going to tamper with it. We're not trying to be deceitful. And that's, I think, another reason we had talked about before of why God gave it to us in an objective form and a written down form so that we can all look at the same thing. Right. And use our, you know, use our brains. If you look at the, you know, the very first church council when they're debating what do the Gentiles have to do to be Christians, they have to get circumcised, whatever. They they use scripture and they gather together and they shared opinions and thoughts and they put their minds together and came up with it. They didn't they didn't just sit around waiting for a word of the Lord to, you know, right in the sky. They were thinking. Yeah, absolutely. And discussing and debating and engaging in the conversation. And they had a they had something that they could use as authoritative in their conversations that they could come back to and say, this isn't just who which of us can argue best. This isn't just which of us is more forceful and can yell more loudly or which one is more popular. This is there's a standard here. And what is required is that we have to match what we're teaching to this standard. Right. And like you said, it's not an economy like in Proverbs two. It starts off with you're searching for wisdom and seeking understanding and you're looking and you're asking all that stuff. And then in verse six, it says for the Lord gives wisdom. Right. So you're like, well, wait, where does wisdom come from? Is it God gives it or am I seeking it? It's both. It's you ask for it, but you grow in wisdom. So you don't have to feel like you got to pick. Okay, so let's go back to that that conversation there because it seems like under observation, we've unpacked it pretty well. The only thing we had left was the literature genre. But so when we talk about interpretation, when you use the word exegesis, meaning we go to it with a blank piece of paper and we draw, we kind of, we draw information from what does it say? Not what do I want it to say? And that's, that's very countercultural. If you, if you ask someone today, what is more important? What I think of when I read John or what John meant when he wrote John, you have a funny feeling, even a whole lot of Christians would say, well, what's more important is what I think or what I feel or what I experience. And it isn't that that isn't important, but it is not most important when it comes to understanding truth. It just, it just isn't. And that's in Christian circles. I've got to imagine in, in almost any other, it would be much, much more a sense of, no, you're, there's only one, there's only one opinion that matters. And that is mine. Only my opinion matters when it comes to what I read or what I experience or what I see or, you know, what mattered more, what the God, the man creating the movie wanted you to experience or what he intended or she intended, or is what more important, what you experienced. And, and it's funny because maybe, maybe in regards to some things like some movies or something like that, it doesn't matter what your answer is to that necessarily. And, uh, but we get that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And we take out the word beauty and we put in truth. And, and now we've messed ourselves up pretty bad. Yeah. So I don't go to scripture that phrase, a verse can never mean what a verse never meant. Yes. Yeah. That's, that's an important one. Yeah. And I think our culture, this goes back to what you've already, we've already covered earlier with the radical autonomy. It's, it really is who are you to say what, what I get out of this version. So it's, it comes down to submitting to the idea that God has something authoritative to say to you. Cause I think a lot of people, they, they invert, we've got scripture and we've got reason and science and experience, but everybody wants to invert that to reverse it to experience comes first. Right. And then my reason, and then maybe scripture, but it's, it just gives you, you're going to end up with two different outcomes depending on what you start with. Absolutely. Yeah. That's, that's huge. And so I think that's important. So, so the, so one part of the interpretation is what did they intend? What did the writer intend? What were they, what's the points they were making? And that's when you have to dive into the context of what their context was, who were they, what were they, when were they, where were they and all that kind of stuff to be able to answer that. And that's why, but it's part, honestly, it seems like this is most of what I do on Sunday mornings when I preach is I am just helping people exit, eat a passage. Like here, here are the proper ways to come at this passage. And, and it's not like I'm God's gift to this. There's thousands of different people doing it who have done it. And, and to be able to say, how do we, how do we unpack this in a way that is the experience of the way they experienced it, understand it the way they understood it. And one of those things that requires is empathy. Like you have to be willing to try to put yourself in their shoes. You'd think that would be something that would be really popular today is how do I put myself in John's shoes or put myself in Mark's shoes? But I think that goes back to the fact that, that everyone except God gets to have an individual identity. Like every, everybody can have radical autonomy except God. And he has to be whatever I want him to be. We talked about that in the last episode. But so that question of empathy, can I get inside their head? Can I get inside their heart and feelings? Understanding the culture and context, understanding all that stuff. And it's, to me, that's not a burden. It is a blast. Yeah. And I think more people would have fun with it too. It's like, it does feel like I'm traveling back in time sometimes. Yeah. It's what I know that the, that it's become more controversial because of some of the creator's statements. Although I don't fully grasp that line of logic. Like people are still watching other TV shows and movies that their, their, their writer's statements are not even close to being right. But, but the chosen, I feel like one of the values of it is it, it, it creates a very good, relatively accurate context based on what we know of what was going on when these things were happening. Right. And that's super powerful. That allows us to interpret and the popularity of it, I think shows how few people have done that. Yeah. Have ever experienced that. They've never gotten to experience that. No one has ever explained it to them in a way to allow themselves to. It kind of comes to life. Yes, exactly. And which then, now that's not, it may not be directly scripture, but it allows us to better interpret scripture sometimes. I do have a question. Yep. And if you want to stay on the interpretation portion, we can keep doing. So we've kind of talked about this framework of observation, spending a lot of time on observation. Yep. And then we move into interpretation and then finally to application. Are there any like common pitfalls or things that are like, that people can move from interpretation to application and get it wrong or there. Oh, yeah. Or what are some things that are good to look out for, I guess, when you're moving from interpretation, understanding something in somebody's context in their town and their in their time. Like how, what are we looking to apply? Is it, are we looking for principles? Are we looking for, Yeah. Yeah. When does that, does that make sense? It does. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to say for, if I'm, if I'm listening to this and I'm trying to understand hermeneutics and I don't, I don't come from a church background. Right. Application wise, are there things I need to be looking for or ways that I can be doing that well? Or is that a really broad question? No, no, it's good. I'm waiting to see if Chris is going to answer first or if I'm going to answer first. You can jump out there. I think the order is important because I think the big pitfall is going to be trying to always jump straight to application. Yes. And there will be many times when you, again, especially if I'm trying to always find a verse for me or God's listening to me, and it might just be, I learned something about God and how he deals with people. And there's not a clear command like, so now today I'm going to go out and act this way. It might be that, okay, I have a different, deeper understanding of who God is that will affect my attitude toward my day. But it might not always, it might not always be that I come away with this clear, oh, that's how I apply this, you know, reading in Ecclesiastes or Song of Solomon or Leviticus. So I think that would be, that was my initial thought of what could happen. Oh gosh. Well, yeah, we've given some examples already of people who jumped to application. They read it, they observe, they usually don't observe very well, but they observe, and then they apply without understanding the context, the conditions, what those people were. We saw David do it a couple of times with the Old Testament passages that he read it and was like, well, that would mean this. And it doesn't mean that. And so what Chris said earlier is true. You, it is totally appropriate to read Scripture and to look at it and see how it's speaking to you and just read it. And that is a good thing to do. But if you jump to application before you understand really what's going on, you can get to a lot of trouble. So for example, think about when Jesus told his disciples that if their eye causes them to lust, they should pluck it out. And if their hand causes them to sin, they should cut it off. Well, I feel confident that of the 12, much less the 70 who were with him, probably most of them, their eyes had caused them to lust and their hands had caused them to sin. But none of them cut their hands off or plucked their eyes out. So they in that process, so if you just read that passage and you didn't do any good hermeneutics and didn't study it at all, and you went straight to application, you would have a lot of blind and helpless Christians out there. But when you look at the context, you're able to understand that Jesus is speaking in a term of prioritization and almost hyperbole of prioritization. It's this important. And you understand that. And part of how you understand that is you look at the passages around it and you see that it doesn't say so all of his disciples went and began plucking their eyes out and cutting their hands off. So they understood him in that moment to be making a point that they did not apply as he means this exactly the way it sounds. They got that from the context. So if you read that today and you didn't know that, you could take it and run with it and have all kinds of bad habits. We talked about in the last podcast, all the different bad things that have happened by people doing bad hermeneutics, whether it's defending Nazism or slavery. I mean, what's interesting is it's only been about 10 years ago that I shocked a roomful of people here by saying that the Bible does not forbid, I don't like the word race, trans ethnic, cross ethnic marriage. And many of them still thought the Bible taught that. If you'd asked them, does the Bible teach that people of different ethnicities shouldn't get married? And a lot of people would in that group that was teaching at that time would have said, yes, absolutely. And they were shocked when I was like, okay, well, show me because I don't see it. And so what they what they would do is they would go to these these deep Old Testament passages that were specifically for the Jewish people about not intermarrying with people of other religions. Some of the people they weren't allowed to intermarry with were the same race as the Jews. And so it had nothing to do with ethnicity. It was it had to do with the fact that they were not following God, not following Yahweh. And that's actually when it says not to intermarry with them, it says because they will draw you off to other gods, it doesn't say anything about the ethnicity. And so and that's why the correct understanding of that in the New Testament is the Apostle Paul saying, you shouldn't be married to a nonbeliever, because that's creates an unequal yoke, like it's that creates a problem that doesn't work well. But it was amazing how that bad hermeneutic people had jumped from, oh, I read it, it says, don't get a tattoo, or it says, you know, you shouldn't marry somebody from this other tribe or culture. And then I'm just going to apply that well, we then we shouldn't do that. That is that's an awful hermeneutic. They didn't correctly observe. They didn't even observe very well. And they didn't interpret at all. They just skipped interpretation. And most often when we see that. I think we see it with the health and wealth movement today, in Christianity, is you see that people observe a passage, and then they apply it, and they don't bother to interpret it. Yeah, so that so that's a common pitfall that can lead to bad hermeneutics is removing the step of interpretation. So let's clarify the language. It is bad hermeneutics, it leads to faults. It leads to bad truth, or yes, okay, true, gotcha. Hermeneutics is a path towards discovering the truth within revelation. In the same way, the scientific method is a path for discovering the truth within empirical evidence, or logic is a path for discovering the truth and reason. And so this is a path for that it would be bad hermeneutics to do that. And you would end up therefore the conclusion you end up with will be jacked. Yes, it'll be wrong. And again, we see it all the time. Well, so often people just and it's not that God can't do this, but they're like, Lord, give me something today. And they just open their Bible and the first thing their finger lands on. That's my word for the day. And they don't know, you know, really, even where they've landed or who's doing the talking or, I mean, I know I did that as a high schooler, a lot, or I just wanted to open it and got and it was lazy. It was really lazy. I just wanted something right away. And it was all about me and what I got out of it. I've compared it to if I had a hot cup of water in one hand and a teabag in the other hand, and I reach over and I just dip it in and pull it out. Do I have tea now? And the answer would be, yeah, probably not really, even though I did what you're supposed to do, put the teabag in the water. But I'm thinking of the word meditating is kind of like that where you're letting it sit and you're you're thinking about it and you're looking at it. And I just think people are impatient. Yeah. It is one of the immediate meaning or, you know, it doesn't make sense to me. And so therefore I'm just going to ignore it or skip it or say it's dumb rather than taking taking the time. Yeah. And there's no doubt I totally sympathize when someone hears all this and they either say, why not have time for that? Right. Well, that's okay. There's plenty of good material written. There's good sermons being taught to help you do it. That's one. It's important enough that it is worth the effort to do at least some of this. This really applies. This really jumps out in passages that are problem quote, problem passages that when you run into it and you go, whoa, wait a minute, especially dive into the hermeneutics of those. You know, you may not need the hermeneutic to read the feeding of the 5,000, even though there's treasure to be found there if you use it. But but instead to say, okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna I want to do this when I'm doing study. It's okay to read and not do this depth of study every time you read. But Chris is right. You don't want to just cut and paste here and there like, oh, verse here, verse there. Like you're better off reading through scripture. And I'm a big fan of what the old Rich Mullins used to say that the musician, Christian musician was that you read Matthew, Mark, Luke and John 10 times each. Then you move on to some of Paul's letters. But and I don't think anything wrong with that mindset. If you're new to it, start with where the core is and the core is Jesus Christ and where his narratives are and the stories about him and the accounts of him on earth. And that's a great place to start is with those. And and then build from that, I think is a great. I think that's a very healthy strategy, knowing it's not it doesn't have to get it's going to get more difficult with other passages for sure. And then the other thing I totally sympathize with is when people say, well, gosh, then it seems like using this process, you can say it, you can try to make it say whatever you want to say. And I would say a response that would be like, yeah, there's something to that. But it's not nearly as bad as if you don't do these things. Then it's very easy to make it say whatever you want to say. That's actually more difficult to follow these principles. And then when you follow these principles, you end up with pretty good commonality across the board for people using these well. Yeah, that's a lot. I'm recognizing that's a lot. Yeah, so is a lot. I think we're going to jump into if not next time soon, guys, the conversation about people being hurt in church, because I feel like that's a common one right now. And I don't I don't know how many people are, you know, may help support their faith or help them reconstruct their faith. This conversation is on hermeneutics and the trustworthiness of Scripture, I think is helpful, because sometimes they get undermined and they don't know how to answer and it just questions and all that kind of stuff. At the same time, I also think for a lot of people, that that conversation, that path starts with being hurt. There's a quote I was telling the guys, Chris, that I heard this week from someone who said, I'm gonna see if I can look up if it was, I don't know if it was just someone I was talking to, or if it was a they were quoting somebody, but someone who I'm paraphrasing it, people saying we're not rejecting the church. We're rejecting the community of abusers masquerading as the church. And, and I feel like we need to, we need to kind of unpack that conversation of what about when being part of the church or being a Christian is hard for you because of what you're experienced, because of your attractions, because of your desires, because what you want in life, because what you've faced in life and being a Christian seems hard. I have another friend who's who wrestles through with same sex attraction as an issue that he's wrestling through right now. What do I believe about this? What do I want in this? And, and he won't talk about it. But one of the questions he just pointedly, which I thought was totally appropriate, said, it just, it just doesn't seem fair that God is asking me to give something up that he's not asking you to give up. And, and I think that's a fair conversation for us to have. And so I think this is a place to have it. I wanted, I don't want it to have it today because I want Bryn, want all of us to be here for that one. And maybe it'll be when I'm back from Israel. But anyway, just have those, have those thoughts in mind. When is your trip? I leave Thursday. Get back in 10 to 10, 11 days. Great. Hey, we might have said this. I can't, I feel like we might have said it back in the fall early on, but just encourage people as we're to wrap up the Bible study thing to, to not be afraid to go to other believers and ask what they think, to not feel like you're all alone. You got to figure this out and kind of like the contradictions part where it might be the first time you've thought about it and it might freak you out. It doesn't mean it's not the first time it's been thought about. And the same thing if you're reading something, go to, go to another believer and say, I don't understand this. It seems weird. I might've used this before, Chris, you'll love this. And maybe I said this, but on the Petra Never Say Die album, there's this song, healing my old man. And when I was in seventh grade and I heard that song, I was like, what in the world? Like I did not understand. And there was a guy who worked with our youth and I was like, I don't understand. What is he talking about? And then he explained, he's talking about your old self and your, you know, your lesson. And I was like, oh my goodness. I was scared, but I was troubled and I bothered. Mattress, I gotta go kill my old man. I know. I was like, what are you talking about? Exactly. I think, again, when you read sometimes, it's like when, if I were to watch a cricket game, it just looks so weird. Because I don't know what it's just because I don't know what's going on. But if someone were sitting there and like, oh, let me explain what happened, then it'd be way easier than trying to figure out what's happening. I might eventually get it. I was going to say that you'd just, you'd still be really confused. But yeah, absolutely. But I do also think that if somebody's listening to this and they're like, okay, I feel like I have a good grasp of hermeneutics, but I kind of want to like, I don't even know if I believe that Bible is a reliable text or something like that. We have done other episodes. So if this is where last few, yeah, if this is where you are entering the conversation, please send us in your questions, but know that we have revisit or we have visited a lot of this, especially on the reliability of scripture and stuff about that. So please go back and look for those. Spring Baptist church. Remember, don't give up. Trust God.
