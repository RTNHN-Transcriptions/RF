We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. I'm Colson Lechner sitting here with Chris Legg and Chris Sherrod. Today we are going to be talking about Christianity and all things Christianity. We're going to condense everything about Christianity into a 30 minute podcast. That should be as if us being Chris and Chris wasn't confusing enough. Today's topic is Christianity. It's Chris, Chris and Christ today. We thought, okay, we're continuing our definition series and so it would be a great thing to define what it means to be a Christian. What is a Christian? Doesn't this seem like this should be easy? I think. It seems like it should be. It isn't at all. Why? I think that's a great question. And that's what we will tackle. We ought to do a whole podcast about that. I did a project with a... that was my Harry Potter pee there. We were talking about sounds at the beginning of words before we got started. But we don't want to get too far off. Just know there's such a thing as a de-esser. That's all you need to know for life. I had a theology class and we had two dry erase boards on the room. I said, okay, let's do a project. We were doing basic theology and I said, let's do a project. On this board, we're going to write all the things that have to be true in order for you to be saved or in order to be a Christian. Everything on this board is everything that has to be true in order for you to be a Christian. On this board is everything you have to know or believe in order to be a Christian. Can you guess already what figure in history became the lynch point for this conversation? Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket. I don't know. I don't know. The thief on the cross. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because he's one of the few people we know from history who apparently made it. We already know his judgment final. As far as we know, his conversion happened within minutes or hours of his death. He didn't join a church. He didn't know such a thing as the church. He was never baptized. He didn't walk an aisle. As far as we know, unless you count him the words he spoke to Jesus out loud as a prayer, we never prayed a prayer. So it ended up being, we ended up kind of this conclusion, everything on the what has to be true in order for me to be a Christian, we decided we could never fill it. Partially because we actually don't know the answer to a lot of that. We don't know all the different things that go into that. But when you start thinking about, well, one, I need to be alive. So then you go down the whole design question of, so if there were no life in the universe, we couldn't be, let's say a whole heading like, okay, we don't want to go too far down that one. That's nuts. What do you have to believe about the Trinity? Like does there have to be a Trinity in order for us to be saved? I would say yes. And so we'll unpack the whole Trinity conversation. Does Jesus have to be fully God and fully man? Yes, that has to be true. Do I have to believe that or know that or understand it in order to be a Christian? And I would say, no, I don't think the thief on the cross of the cross, if you'd asked him, so what are your Trinitarian views? I don't think he'd have had any. I don't know if Moses did. Yeah. And so it's a wild conversation to begin realizing, honestly, just how short the list. And you guys are, I'm doing right hand and left hand for those of you who are in the podcast world on the right hand dry race board of what do you have to know and believe in order to be saved in order to be a Christian? And that list became every time we'd write something up there, someone raised their hand and go, yeah, but what about? And we didn't be racing it and ended up being shockingly short. Yeah, it ended up summarying that kind of coming down to like Romans 10 kind of became the summarizing those kind of those who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved. Yeah. Maybe even if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart, that God raised him from the dead. But but even then, like, what do I have to believe about that God raising from the dead? So what do I have to believe about that? Even that became incredibly short. The so the one the one thing was full to overflowing. And we acknowledged probably this side of heaven. We won't know the answer to what all has to be true. So how about that? That was a I think that's why it's hard is because people think Christianity is dependent upon that left board. And we don't all agree with everything on the left board. And we don't always know when we're right or wrong about things on the left board. So anyway, I think that's part of what creates the problem is we've been debating for 2000 years the things on the left board. And Christianity, in its essence, is fundamentally about the things on the right board with all the things on the left board being the important stuff we feel. No, I'm not not not saying they're not significant. They are like the Trinity is significant. It's not just a spring in the trampoline. Right. Remember that book? The Velvet Elvis. Oh, that again, I'm gonna be talking too long. But the the velvet Elvis book, gosh, came out about 01 about the turn of the millennia. Anyway, but that was Rob, Rob Bell, Bell. And and he said that that the beliefs in Christianity were like springs in a trampoline and you could remove a lot of them, but you could still bounce. And his three examples were number one, Age of the Earth, which someday we will discuss, I'm sure, because Chris and Chris have different opinions on that one. Yeah. And and when I was like, agreed, that's a spring in the trampoline. What you believe about the age of the earth, you could still be a Christian no matter what your views are within limits. But then the next one was the virgin birth. I was like, interesting. That may be a leg on the trampoline. The trampoline may fall down without the right bird. And the third one was the Trinity. Really? And he was like, so you could remove that. He actually was very flippant in it. If I remember correctly, he said something about what if Jesus's dad was a guy named Ralph? And it just turns out the whole virgin birth story was a story meant to protect Mary's reputation. Would that mean I couldn't be a Christian if that's what I believed? It's like, I think it might. So anyway, there's a lot of ignorance that is open. So that's going to be part of the conversation. What has to be true? What do I have to believe? And then what could I believe wrongly and then have the wrong God? Now I'm dealing with the wrong person. So anyway, I hear your thoughts. No, it's true. It's like I remember talking to a Mormon in my house about salvation and he actually said, I believe that it's solely through faith in Jesus. And I was like, wait, does your church know you believe that? Like he was saying that. Right. But then I had to say, okay, but it's what your faith is in. What do you believe about Jesus? And so then that led to this other thing like, okay, so we don't believe in the same Jesus. What do you believe is he's a created being that went through the steps of consultation. So again, on the surface, it sounded like we were talking about the exact same thing or purpose or salvation or person. But when you begin to define it, and I think that's again, what we're doing here, you start to go, okay, so we're not talking about the same thing. And that's part of what makes it tough. You know, Vody Baucom before I knew he was famous, the first thing I heard him teach on was, so Vody's a big African American man. And he said he summarized it this way. He said, sometimes you have a conversation with somebody about God. And it's like if you and I and he did the he, of course, he really played this up. Vody's a incredibly talented speaker, but he played up the whole I was I saw I met Vody Baucom this weekend. And somebody else going like, no way, Vody Baucom. You met the one and only. So of course, he totally played this up for laughs. But he ended up saying at the end of the conversation, the other guy goes, hey, tell you what, next time you see that little Asian squirt, you tell him I said hi. And he was like, oh, wait, no, we OK, sorry. Oh, we may have the wrong guy. Like we may have the wrong person. Like we have the same name, but we don't have the right for the same person. Yeah. And he delineated that between people who claim to worship God. But but the God that they worship is not is nothing like the God revealed in Scripture. And he said, we'll never know where is that? Where is the magic line of I've got the right name, but I've got the wrong guy and how much wrong guy stuff can I believe? And it's still credited me as just ignorance because we all are going to have that. Right. Yeah. And but they said that it's OK when you realize OK, same name, a long coffee dinner with a friend of mine who was a Koran apologist. Defended the Koran as God's word. So that's what that means. And we had coffee and he started the conversation with saying we worship the same God. And in the end, I said, I just feel like we discussed is God friend, which is no for Allah, is God father, which is an absolute no for Allah. That's that's friend you can almost get away with Allah as friend to the merciful. But father, it's actually considered shirk. It's the major sin in Islam to call him as a major sin to call him father. And then he doesn't have a son named Jesus Christ, who is God. And so I was like, I feel like we got the same name, but I don't think we have the same person. Yeah. At some point, we've got to have we must be remissing something. Well, and you can't I mean, that's what happens on social media all the time. You're trying to find someone and you type in their name and then you get like two hundred results and you can't just go, well, I personally believe it's that one and be like that. It doesn't matter if it has the same name. You're not talking about the same. Yeah. Same person. So what is then, Chris, how would you summarize like if you had to define what what is Christianity? No pressure. Right. Exactly. So just taking a deep breath for those who say the essentials we Colson, I had talked about this a few minutes ago about what are the most foundational things. And what I would say, it's what we what I do know that we can know about us. Here's what God has told us. And I'm not counting like someone who's never seen a Bible, never heard like I'm just talking about in general for for most people in the modern world, the idea that God is one, but he's three persons. So that's the Trinity. Right. And the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is not the Father. And yet they're one, they're equal in essence. And that's we try to come up with analogies or things that just like, yeah, can't because it's unique. Yeah, they all fall short in some way. Right. And usually you're you're now you're actually giving an example of a heresy when you try to do that, because there's literally nothing like that. So but that's not strange. I mean, if I say my wife is like, right, is that all analogies always fall apart when you're talking about a unique. Yeah. And God is unique. Yeah. So there are lots of things that are three and one. That's not strange. Lots of things are three and one. There's not three and one the exact same way that God is three and one. And so that's when people say it's logically incoherent for God to be three and one. Like that's that's dumb. All kinds of things are three and one. That's not even uncommon. Happens a million different ways. Yes, the way he's three and one is unique. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. No. So anyway, so the the Trinity and then with that piece is going to be that then the sun came to earth and was fully God and fully man. So that's called the hypostatic union. Not that he's like a demigod, half God, half man, like he's fully God and fully man. Um, and then the, I would just say, then you're going to land on salvation that it's obviously this is rebuilding God's word, but, um, that Jesus live the life we should have lived, died the death. We should have died. And he offers that as a free gift. And so that thing, and then I would add in there rose again, conquered death, but he offers this to us freely. And I think that right there is going to separate Christianity from everything else because everything else is going to be either you, you spell salvation D O whereas we would spell salvation D O N E. If that helps. But, but again, you're so good with those. You do so much better than me, but that's, that's what it's going to come down to is, um, what are you trusting in to repair your relationship with God or to get you into heaven right now in our evangelism class, the, the two diagnostic questions are, do you know for certain if you die today, go to heaven? And first on five 13 says, I write these things to you who believe in the sun that you may know that you have eternal life. But then the second question is, if you were to die and God were to say, why should I let you into my heaven? What would you say? And so with their answer, you're, you're, you're discovering what are you depending on? Is it your good works? Uh, just, I believe in God or I pray, or I've been a good person. Or I've never murdered or I, whatever, but it's all going to come down to what are you, what are you basing it on? And that's what the Bible just says. I always go back to Paul's only claim that we would have before God from flipping through. He says, not having a righteousness of my own that comes by works, but that which is through faith in Jesus. So other stuff, I think will be related, but at the core, I think that's what I would go by. And again, we believe the, the Old and New Testament are God's word. Um, yeah, I don't know. Those are my basics. What do you think? It's, it's, it's so tough because those are the basics. Those, I would agree. Those are the basics of mirror kind of mirror Christianity to use C.S. Lewis's term. And yet you could not know those and be a Christian. My three year old didn't know most of those when he put his faith in Christ. And so it's, it's a, it's such a tough. Yes. Those are the standards of Christian. Those are what Christianity is. Without those Christianity isn't what it is. And it's, it's a, if there, if there isn't a trinity, a triune God, if there isn't a God, the son and the hypostatic union, if there, then Christianity is false. And I think if we come at it from that perspective, what would make Christianity false? Those are some great ways to come at it is if Jesus didn't come experience life as a human being to pay the sins, to pay for our sins, to purchase a right relationship with God. If he didn't do that, then Christianity is not a thing. If there is no God, Christianity is not a thing. If God is not three in one, Christianity is not a thing. And I totally agree with that. And so I think those are the fundamentals. The next question though, is given in a simple sense that there is a God and our relationship with him comes through a provision provided by him. I'm a provision given by him and that provision is the person and work of Jesus Christ. And I think you could summarize pretty simply like, like that. Now that within even that statement, I mean, we could go back and say, let's see, I believe in God, the father, almighty maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten son, our Lord, and do the whole apostles creed type thing, which had, that's what apostles creed was written to be. This is what Christianity is. If it's, if any of these lines isn't true, then Christianity isn't true. And that's what we, so when we're discussing in here, when over, when we define Christianity, we're talking about the Christ centric faith, the provision revelation of what we call the holy Bible, old and new Testament. Now, again, none of that is, it still requires the work of the spirit in our lives. The work of God working those things out in our lives, et cetera. And the good grace that he gives us. But when we talk about Christianity in here, those are going to be the things that we keep coming back to fundamentally. I want to come back to here. Here's something that, that when we're talking about reconstructed faith, Chris, you were saying something right before we got started that I think is vital when it comes to deconstructed faith or reconstructed faith. And it has to do with trusting God for something he hasn't promised. So you might, you might talk about the sheep analogy thing as we build to that. Because I think very often the faith that people deconstruct doesn't, is, should be deconstructed. And anyway, well, and it said, yeah, it's the Tim Keller quote that I mentioned before, that if someone says they don't believe in God, he'll say, well, describe for me the God you rejected, because I might not believe in him either. Right. And it still goes back to what we said before, that some people have this straw, straw man faith that they've built up something that they say as Christianity, but then it gets easily knocked down because they were, they had a wrong assumption. So Colson and I were talking about sheep and I was showing them videos of cast sheep, which is just so funny that God calls the sheep so often because sheep really are helpless and dumb. Yeah. And they'll get stuck on their back. But I heard this analogy and or the story and I've never seen it for myself. But supposedly if you have a bunch of sheep going through like a shoot single file and they're moving along in a line, if you put like a stick in the way in front of one of them, in other words, to get by, he's got to jump over it. So each sheep gets to the stick, he'll jump. Supposedly, if you remove the stick, the sheep after that will still jump at that point. They'll just continue to jump. So why did you jump? Well, the guy before me jumped. And then why are you jumping? Well, because that guy jumped and there's no reason behind it. There's no there's nothing in front of them making them jump. It's just what they saw someone else in front of them do. So the thought there is for a lot of people, they want to keep the label Christianity, but the content of their faith, I compare it to like a box that says Christianity on the front of it. But what you're putting in your box is actually a whole lot of beliefs or you're keeping out a whole lot of beliefs that actually, you know, aren't there or should be there. So a lot of young people are deconstructing a faith that never either was their own faith. Right. They were just jumping because their parents in front of them jumped or they've they've built into it a lot of these expectations of God who will never let me go through pain or a God who, you know what I'm saying, is always right. I don't know. Makes me happy. And so then you just go, well, that's of course you're disappointed because he never promises that he wouldn't do that. But if you believe that about God, then you're going to be disappointed and think like, well, the God that I believe, and I guess it was all a sham, you know, verses like, well, now you had a wrong view of God that needed to be corrected. Yes. I'm going through the book of Ecclesiastes with our young professionals. Cool. Which is so fun. And what I love about it is it's the what I'm calling the joyful realist of you really can still enjoy life, but you're realistically saying, but we live in a Genesis three world. We live in a fallen world. And one of the things that make people doubt God so often is like bad things are happening. Right. It's like a picture. I'm just going, well, I did you not read Ecclesiastes? Like I gave you that book as a reminder. Like it's not always going to turn out the way you wanted. That's not going to bring you satisfaction. I gave you that book to help you be realistic about life. Right. And your happiness is not the goal of life. And so again, I think for a lot of people, it's like, well, you're going to be disappointed if that's what you expected, you know, your faith to be like. Yes. So I don't, I don't know about the sheep one. What I use in the counseling office all the time is elephants is the example of elephants. That when they're staked to the ground as a child, their ankle, they put a cuff around the ankle or chain around the ankle and stake them to the ground, but they stake them to a concrete that's underground that the elephant can't see. So they'll have fights and struggles against it up to a certain point. And then someday it will stop and it won't pull on the chain anymore. And allegedly, though I've not seen it, not found it, elephants have died in fires, staked to the ground with a three foot long stake. Of course, these are animals that can pull a tree up by the root system. Right. And yet they will stand and die there. Um, and, and I think I see sometimes so often with people who are deconstructing their faith, it's that what they were told or taught, this is Christianity. This is what God requires of you. This is what it means to be a believer, but it's really just a human invention. And they've been staked to the ground with a three foot long stake. And when they discover that the state comes up out of the ground, it no longer offers security. It no longer offers anything to them. And now they're just mad. And I get that. I mean, I understand why you would be, I've experienced it myself when you have a belief. This is much, this is what you're supposed to believe. This is what you have to believe. And then when you realize you read the scripture for yourself, you're either set free in a positive way to, okay, I need to worship the God who is not the God who I was raised on, or I'm set free to then not worship anything but myself. Cause I don't trust anything but myself. And I think so often that's when people deconstruct, which is understandable. Again, they need to pull that chain up. I think when Jesus talks about us bearing burdens and he says, come to me, you are a weary and heavy laden and I will rest you. He then says by giving you essentially a yoke and a burden, which doesn't make any sense unless he's taking away all the others. And I think so often what Christians need to do is deconstruct the childish faith they have, the Santa Claus faith. They have the, I don't know what all the legalistic. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was raised with was the not intentionally, but was very much so the man. I, if I mess up today, I could, God's going to be really, really mad and he might send me to hell if I die in my sleep. And it was just such a scary fear base, not grace base, not biblical. It's just not biblical based, not biblically sound version of Christianity. And in rebelling against that though, I didn't have to rebel against all of it. Just take the false stuff. And so, yeah, there was a, I think even, even though Chris Sherritt tends towards a young earth theory of, of earth and I tend towards an older theory. I think we'd still appreciate, I had a doctor come as a client years ago for a single session came to you. She said, because I know you're Christian, but I didn't want to talk to a professional Christian. I just want to talk to a Christian who could talk with me because I'm, I, I want to become a Christian, but I can't believe the earth is only 6,000 years old. It was created in six days. And I said, good news. You don't have to believe that to be a Christian. Like that's not, there are plenty of Christians who believe it and plenty of Christians who don't, and people have been debating about it at least since the second generation of Christians. So good news. You can believe the earth is very, very old and still be a Christian. And she said, you're kidding me. I said, no, that's no, no, here's, here's, here's like nine books by people who are godly men and women who have written about it. And she said, well, then I want to be a Christian. It's like that was, that was the only barrier she had been told. Yeah. This was a barrier between you and following Christ. And when she learned it was, I was like, oh good. Okay, good. Let's do that. Then it's a great cool. Can you go on my website and tell everybody how good of a counselor that I am? In one session. Which is that by the way, is very weird. That's not normal. What counseling is all in fact, I didn't, I prayed with her in that session, which is actually kind of strange for me, but then I required her because some people will become a Christian for counseling homework. So I don't, I don't usually encourage that. Yeah. Who do you know who you love, who you could pray with? But anyway, it was, it was purely, she had been raised on a belief. That was all that was keeping her was this, this equals this. And when she discovered, okay, that doesn't equal that now, now go and figure out what you believe about the age of the earth. Knock yourself out. Yeah. Read the scriptures, read the books, go nuts. And, but it, but no one should be telling you that that's a prerequisite for, for following Jesus. Yeah. And I do think that's a good example of a roadblock for a lot of people because they, and this goes back to what we've already talked about in previous podcasts. Because they think that Christianity is all about blind faith. Yes. And they feel like to become a Christian, I've got to walk away from science and reason. And, and so they're not willing to do that. But it's again, you've got this false dichotomy. Like you don't have to pick between science and faith. You know what I'm saying? You can be, you can be both. I mean, you can believe in both and follow both. And I think part of what Christianity, I'm sorry, part of what apologetics does is it removes those roadblocks where Christianity is actually plausible for the first time. Cause like for that lady, it's like, it's not even on my list of options. If that's what it means, then it can't be. And you just go, well, like you said, good news. That's not one of the requirements to become a Christian. And so the thing that you thought was holding you back actually is not a reason. You know, that's right. And again, people will still have excuses or that'll be like their smoke screen. And then apologetics can also remove that and show that the real issue is that you don't want to. A lot of the people that are deconstructing their faith, they've left the youth group and they go into college or beyond. Right. And even having the conversation of what do you look for in a church is a really important question. Absolutely. As far as what are the essentials that I'm going to be fed or the basics that are, that are here, because if you're in the wrong environment, it's going to create either it's going to reinforce this legalism or it's going to make you confused or whatever. So yeah, what would you say if you're looking for a church? Oh my gosh. Um, first off, I do think what you want is someone who is saying we, we defer to the authority of scripture. Um, we may not always know what scripture says. We may not, and you want humble attitudes within this. If you have someone who says, no, we absolutely always know what the Bible says and you need to do what we tell you it says. That's a, that's a huge red flag. So you want a humble attitude of, listen, we don't always know what the, what the Bible is teaching us, but we're willing to work hard to try to understand it. And when we are convinced of what it says, then we defer to the, its authority, whether we like it or not. And so it's kind of funny, like, uh, in one setting I would say, uh, and this is a question, I actually think that's the line at a fundamental level that may be the line between actual what a Christian is, is someone who defers the authority of scripture, trusts it to teach you. Again, not with a blind, foolish, unsophisticated way of studying it. But I think I feel like if someone answers the question, certainly this is what makes an evangelical. I think that if I asked the question, if you knew for sure, I mean, somehow you knew with a hundred percent certainty that the Bible taught something, would you submit to that? And so with some populations, I will say, so if you knew absolutely without any shred of doubt that the Bible taught that to engage in homosexual behavior is sin, would you change? Not, not would you be perfect, but would you go, okay, I agree with that. I agree with that statement. I confess that statement. I will work to obey that statement. I will, I will trust in God to help me obey that statement. Or would you say, well, but I, but I still want to do that. Same thing is true of pre-marital, like so heterosexual sex outside of marriage. Like, would you? Okay. Would you, if you knew that around here, what I say is if you knew with absolute certainty that the Bible taught you that it's wrong to defend yourself. Like if you came to that conviction that it is wrong to defend yourself. You can't shoot somebody. You can't karate chop somebody. You can't stab somebody with a buoy knife. Like if someone, if you knew without any doubt that Christian pacifism was what was taught in scripture, would you get rid of all those weapons? And if the answer is, I just don't think I can. Okay. Well, then you're not, you're not really following. And, and that sounds rigid in some ways, but I think it's a mindset that really is important for us as Christians. And I want to look for that in a church. I want to look for a church that says, listen, we don't always know what it says, but when we become convinced, we do know what it says. That's what we teach. Well, it's like Martin Luther's famous line of my conscience is held captive to the word of God. Yeah. I can't hear, I stand. I can do, you know what I'm saying? Like it's God's word is my authority. And yeah. And then I think you've said it before related to even those topics, especially about sex and homosexuality. So you're either ignorant or rebellious. If you're not following it, like in other words, you didn't know, and now you do know. Right. And now that you know, your options are I can, I can be rebellious and do my own thing and still decide, or I can get in line. Right. And trust that the words by his Holy spirit is going to empower me, but that's going to be the struggle. Right. But I'm, I'm acknowledging, yes, that's what I'm submitting to. Absolutely. Yeah. And that's, that's because you don't want to be, I know this is hard. It's hard for, it's hard for me as a pastor. Um, in the end, I don't want a church full of people to follow me. I don't want a church full of people to follow leadership board or whatever. Cause we're so frail and limited. We actually, our leadership board, each time we meet, we sing or pray the old hymn, be thou my vision, which is about, okay, we don't trust us. We don't trust each other to have right agendas. And so we don't want to trust at all. We know in our own understanding to quote the proverb, we want to lean not on our own understanding, but in all our ways, acknowledge him. I'm going to trust in him with all our heart. And we don't, um, we know we're even bad at that. That's how untrustworthy we are. So you want a church that has a healthy attitude about, we're going to do our best to tell you what scripture teaches to the best of our understanding and encourage you and, and, and, uh, help you equip you to apply that and live that out. It's not just what we think. It's not just what I think. It's not just what a charismatic leader thinks it's not, and that's our goal. So that's, that's an example of something cause you need a true North. I mean, if you're gonna, if you're going to wander through the wilderness, you need something to trust and humans aren't it. I think it was, I was trying to find the quote, but I think it was GK Chesterton that said, it used to be that we were confident in, in believing in, in trusting in, in truth revealed to us and skeptical about ourselves. And he says now it's completely the opposite that we're skeptical about truth and we're totally confident in ourselves that we should trust ourselves. And that's, that's the danger that you're, that you're in where you're wise in your own eyes, which again, that's biblical. You know what? That's, I wonder if we could add, if we should add to our definition of Christianity that we started with is that we are a race in need of saving. Maybe that's a fundamental, certainly an underlying view of the Judeo-Christian world. View. But if there is no sin, there is no Christianity. So if humans can't sin, if we can't be wretches, if we're somehow capable of fixing this problem on our own, then, then Christianity kind of falls apart. Because you don't need, you don't need a savior. Right. You don't need to be saved from anything. So maybe we would start there with saying the crown of Christianity, what we're talking about is as we understand scripture to teach Christianity at the basic level, that we need a savior and God, we need a way to, to repair the relationship with God. And God provided that way through his son. And that's going to be a fundamental and the nature and character of that God. There are certain things that are, that are kind of non-negotiable and a lot of things that are negotiable. And we are, we trust in scripture to reveal to us the truth. Now I say that, but it's also, and then we have to be good students of studying it and digging into it and wrestling through the disagreements and not avoiding the things we don't like. And that's the kind of stuff we're looking for. But again, that's going back to the distinction of, am I happy or is this truth? In other words, acknowledging that I'm a sinner doesn't make me happy, but is it true? And that's where so many people today, all they want to talk about is, but is your lifestyle making you happy? Which that alone, that word can be very dangerous. But Coles and I were talking about parenthood earlier because a lot of people, if you've got this wrong view of God, that he's supposed to always be made happy. And he's always making me happy. Yeah. He would never want me to suffer. He would never want me to struggle. Every parent knows if you're going to be a good parent, that's not your goal. Do I have a happy child? Because we make them go to bed. We make them, we tell them not to eat this, but to eat that. You don't always get your way. You can't watch, you know, Disney movies until three in the morning. Every, every parent knows I'm going to do things that make you uncomfortable or not always happy. But it's, and again, it's because I love you. Right. I'm going to self-destruct if I don't step in. And so again, if your view of God is that he never lets bad things happen to you, then well, of course that God let you down. Right. But that's not the real God. You had a straw man faith. So, you know, in this, in this podcast, I don't know that we have given some good, complete, clear, concise definition of Christianity. In fact, I feel like we certainly haven't. And maybe that's just because that's, that's not something we're capable of doing that, that well. But what, when we talk about our faith, when we talk about Christianity on this podcast, we're going to be talking about the fundamentals as much as possible. I'm sure we will unpack details, but we're not talking about a certain denomination. We're not talking out of a certain polity or church politics. We're not going to be talking about that. That's not the focus of, of this podcast. We don't, what we want people to have are the, the building blocks to reconstruct the fundamentals of their faith as they're engaging with it. When someone faces that deconstruction, when they realize, wait a minute, this is a chain that's been holding my foot down and it's not real. It doesn't have to hold me down. It's not accurate. That's the going through the underroot of the underwear drawer that we talked about a few podcasts ago. Well, then what am I going to put back in? And that's what we want to challenge people with. Okay. How are you going to, what do you believe about truth? What do you believe about faith? What are these things and how do you then engage with and test? Okay. This I keep this I toss. Um, this I keep this I toss. I listened to a little bit of one of our earlier podcasts the other day. Um, and, and I was, I was talking about the, um, uh, that the underwear drawer mindset of, okay, I need to, I need to test this as the Bible says test all of it and keep that, which is right. What the apostle Paul says, we need to test it and figure out and you'll do it your whole life. And maybe that's troubling for people. Maybe they'd rather just be told, listen, this is the right answer and it's all good and that's it, but I feel like it's more complicated. It's more challenging. It's a relationship with an actual person and that's always harder than just, well, and I think too, that's why legalism is always appealing is you, it allows you to look religious, but you don't have to have a heart change. Yeah. Like I just tell me what to do. It's just all the, the, the rigid stuff, the rules that I should follow, but there's no real relationship or heart, heart change there. Yup. Is that just cause it's, it's easier to kind of tick off, take that off the checklist. I think, well, okay, I'm good with God. Well, I don't know. Do you think it's easier and that's why people like it more? Yeah. Well, it's, it's convenient in that I can, there's a difference between fitting my life into Christ and fitting Christ into my life. Like, but it that way, like there's one way I'm adding him onto, uh, like the schedule is mine, but Jesus gets an appointment versus the schedule is his, like he's fully sovereign or. You know, he's a character in my story versus he's the director producer star. You know what I mean? Yeah. I have a role. So I think it is easier just if I get to add that on versus it totally consumes everything about me and that's where Jesus gives a pretty high call of if you're not willing to give up everything, then you're not worthy to be my disciple or to follow me. Like that's what I'm asking you to do. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith. If you enjoyed what you heard or were challenged, please leave us a review.

He offers this to us freely.&lt;br /&gt;\n12:55 - What separates Christianity from everything else. Everything else spells salvation as: D-O. Works based salvation.Christianity spells salvation: D-O-N-E. Christ has done the work for us to be saved.&lt;br /&gt;\n13:17 - Two diagnostic questions:\u00a0\u2043 Do you know for certain that if you were to die today you would go to heaven? 1 John 5:13 \u201cI write these things to you who believe in the son, that you may know that you have eternal life.\"&lt;br /&gt;\n\u2043 If you were to die, and God was to say \u201cWhy should I let you into my heaven?,\u201d what would you say?&lt;br /&gt;\n16:14 - Short definition when we, at Reconstructed Faith, talk about Christianity\u2043 We are talking about the Christ-centric faith, the provision and revelation of the Holy Bible (Old and New Testaments).&lt;br /&gt;\n17:17 - Trusting God for something he hasn\u2019t promised.\u2043 Sheep Analogy\u2043 Very often the faith that people deconstruct should be deconstructed\u2043 Tim Keller quote - if someone says they don\u2019t believe in God, he\u2019ll say describe for me the god you rejected, because I may not believe in him either.&lt;br /&gt;\n18:00 - Sheep discussion with Sherrod&lt;br /&gt;\n19:00 - Sherrod Christianity \u201cBox\u201d analogy&lt;br /&gt;\n20:40 - Legg, Elephant discussion&lt;br /&gt;\n23:20 - Roadblock example - Age of the Earth\u00a0&lt;br /&gt;\n25:25 - False Dichotomy some people have\u2043 Having to choose between science and faith&lt;br /&gt;\n26:55 - what to look for in a church conversation\u2043 Deferring to the authority of scripture - humble attitude&lt;br /&gt;\n31:45 - if you\u2019re going to wander through the wilderness, you need a true north, something to trust. Humans aren\u2019t it.&lt;br /&gt;\n32:00 - G. K. Chesterton quote - It used to be that we were confident in trusting in truth revealed to us, and skeptical about ourselves. Now it is the exact opposite. Now we are skeptical about truth and confident to trust ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;\n34:45 - Legg unpacking of Christianity definition\u00a0\u00a0&lt;br /&gt;\n36:38 - The appeal of legalism is that it allows you to look religious without heart change&lt;br /&gt;\n37:00 - Difference between legalism and relationship&lt;br /&gt;\nKey Quotes from the Episode&lt;br /&gt;\nIt\u2019s a wild conversation just how short the list is about what you have to know and believe in order to be a Christian.&lt;br /&gt;\nA lot of people are deconstructing a faith that 1) never was their own faith, essentially jumping because their parents in front of them jumped (see sheep analogy, 18:00) or 2) they have built into it all these expectations of God who, for example, will never let me go through pain, or who always makes me happy.
