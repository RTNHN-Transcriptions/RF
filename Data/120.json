We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined as always by my partners in crime, Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. And today we have kind of a twofer. We have kind of a current event that we want to discuss a little bit of insight on. And then also we had a listener question. And so, Brent, if you can have kind of that listener question queued up for us. The other thing that so for the for the current event, you know, this is we're recording this now at the very end of January 2025. There's been a new presidential administration. And obviously, that we're not what we're not going to do is comment on every single thing about the inauguration and everything that has now happened in this last, it hasn't even been a week. But there were some things with regard to kind of the Christian space that kind of took a front row seat in some, I would say, like some headlines or things that happened. And specifically, what I'm thinking about is during a during and I don't even know, Brent, if you or Chris, if you know, like what the name of the service was, but there was a church service, can you say can you speak to that, Chris? Yeah, this is the inaugural prayer service. It's been a tradition. It's not like required or anything like that. But it's been a tradition for a while now that they do these this prayer service. And they've done it in various locations. But most recently, they've been doing it in the National Cathedral, which is one of the funkiest places on the planet, in my opinion, having been there, you know, it's a multi faith cathedral. And obviously, Cathedral already, when you're talking about the government, makes us nervous, the idea that there is such a thing as a church cathedral run by the US government. You probably people have an opinion about that already, much less that we that it's been staffed, but it's an Episcopal Cathedral, officially, that the Episcopal Church operates this cathedral. And so the bishop, the bishop, one of the bishops there, and spoke at this prayer event, and she got a lot of attention for it because of her, on her comments. So that's kind of the current event. Part of this because we got a lot of news. And we've, you know, several times on this podcast, we've talked about the role of politics in religion as a cause of deconstruction, that people see their parents being overly political and linking it too much to, to their faith, or they have had that experience, or they feel like it's not appropriate how much overlap they see. And so they've deconstructed, in an effort to deconstruct certain political stances or political views, they end up deconstructing their faith as well. And though there are certainly overlaps, and we've talked about many of them, we've talked about, you know, in our whole series on is the Bible immoral by today's standards. I mean, some of those standards also have political edge to them, like abortion or LGBTQ issues, or defining a family or how you what a marriage is. And those have crossover. And so those can be that's a gonna be a challenge. But then there are other issues as well that come into that, what the Bible actually says about these things. And it's important to understand that the Episcopal Church as a whole, not universally, by the way, not at all universally, and plenty of priests and Episcopal Church would not say this, but in general have really come to see Scripture, the Holy Bible as not authoritative, that it's a it's a book of wisdom and insight, but it's not an authority. So so that's a that's they don't treat it as authoritative. Did y'all keep did I did I everything y'all froze for a second there just making sure we got you got the audio? Okay, good. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, today, we're not only only Colson was actually in studios today. Anyway, lots of flu going around, and sicknesses in our homes and that kind of stuff. So anyway, but so that's, that's what's going on. And I think probably the way we've talked about in the past, has kind of drawn attention more to the conservative side of this than the more liberal side of this that parents who are overly conservative in their and link their theology to their politics have led to some people deconstructing for sure over time. And in this case, you have kind of the opposite instead of a, you know, a, you know, pastor at First Baptist Dallas openly making a political statement from the pulpit. Here we have the Anglican or sorry, Episcopalian is the American version of Anglicanism. That's why I said that. But the Episcopalian priest leader, bishop, making a very overtly political statement, though it is some of it is about moral issues. It's a very overtly political statement. And part of how you know is that her this part of her sermon, though, which I would put that in scare quotes, begins with, let me make one final plea, Mr. President. And so I think you can assume that what's about to come out of her mouth is at least is going to have political tones, because it's not a plea to God's people. It's a plea to the political authority of America. So anyway, I'm curious what you guys have seen play out about it. And then we can unpack a little bit more what she said. I think, yeah, I think it's interesting, because like you were saying, it's kind of the other side of what we've talked about. And it's interesting, because I think, and we can kind of talk about specifics, but it feels like from how she spoke and kind of how it was presented, and then how some of my friends that are, you know, more liberal, theologically, or, you know, left leaning, have responded on social media, it seems like this, the danger of this other kind of side of it, then what we've talked about is that people, it would encourage people to stray from biblical understanding and embrace kind of like a version of Christianity that is more palatable with the culture. And it's kind of like a molding Christianity to fit, you know, which we've talked about on the conservative side, but molding Christianity to fit what I believe politically, or what I feel like I want Christianity in Christ to say, instead of going to Scripture and saying, okay, well, what does he actually say, like you're saying the authoritative piece, the Scripture authoritative, but one of my friends posted, I can't remember, I wish I could remember the exact wording, because it was more concise. But basically, he said, he posted and said, look at all these Christians mad about someone presenting Christian theology. And we can unpack like what she actually said in a minute. But I was like, that is so fascinating. Because if you're not theologically grounded, and you just watch what she said, it's like, yeah, she appeals to empathy and kindness and care for others. And a lot of things that face value are Christian tenants of like, oh, caring for others and caring for the caring for the foreigner. And like, she says things in a way that is very Christian. But a lot of the things that she ended up saying were had undertones of like theologically inaccurate. And so if you're not grounded, it is really confusing. And you're like, wait, what does this mean? Like, if I say that anything that she said is wrong, that feels horrible. But also, is that what Christianity stands for? You know, like, it could be really conflicting, I think. And so I think it's important for people to unpack like, okay, just like anything else, this is nuanced. It's not us versus them. And and for sure, you cannot, as a believer, align yourself with a political party and be like, oh, they they're the one that's speaking for God now. Anyway, Colson, yeah, well, and I really don't have much to add to that. I think what at least what I've seen on social media, and then on, you know, regular media, I know that that bishop has now gone on kind of a press tour. Fascinating. And, you know, being lauded or speaking up and being willing to be going to stand up and share and whatever. Yeah, kind of ironic, isn't it ironic? I'm like, if that's like the main, if that is the main. Anyway, go ahead. And I think to to what and I don't know if Chris, if this is what you said before we were on air or not, I think where my mind goes is is kind of where what you had mentioned with like, okay, this was a it is a cultural. It is in line with kind of cultural values. And so it is celebrated. Right. When somebody from the church aligns and stands up against, you know, what people perceive as the enemy of the of culture. And I'm just I'm using that as a generalization right now. But it's like better for some reason. But if conservatives talk about biblical values, or just a biblical value, not necessarily conservative or whatever, it's just a biblical value. Let's talk about, you know, we talk about a lot of different things. But we can talk about abortion and marriage and those types of things that were like, hey, this is what it says in the Bible. Then it's like, oh, well, I mean, then the press goes on a tirade. And, you know, it would be it would be, I mean, I can't see some like, somebody making an appeal from a US government sanctioned cathedral or whatever, and people not asking for their head or at least their job versus this person. And it's like, there's no way that this person is losing their job or whatever, you know what I mean? And so that's kind of where my brain goes. So this is one of those Yeah, if you imagine, let's make it like an exact equivalent, as much as we can and say, so during, so you during Biden's inauguration, that, that a pastor, you know, from Dallas came went up and spoke at the cathedral, and gave a very intentional treatise on the important of national boundaries as discussed in Scripture, and how important it is for a nation to protect its boundaries from an invasion of foreigners coming in and, and how those foreigners have to be treated. And one of the ways those foreigners have to be treated is to be not allowed in easily, and that they have to have a conversion experience. And so imagine if, if someone had gotten up and said, so what we need to be doing is, you know, do we need to be circumcising all of these people who are coming in, in the same way the Jews would have, and someone would go, wait, I'm not, I'm not sure that's a correct application of the biblical teaching to now. And, and it sure does seem to back your view, you're using Scripture to kind of back the view you had in advance. And how dare you do that at a political event, and blah, blah, blah. So I think the about the separation of church and state. Yes, exactly. So I think one of the things we always need to be aware of, especially when it comes to deconstruction, is, is to recognize all of us have a tendency to be okay with the rules being broken, so long as they're broken in our favor. And we just need to be aware of that, like if you're deeply offended when the wall of the separation of church and state goes down, as it, but you're not very offended when it's your side that does that, whichever that, by the way, whichever side that is, that says something about us and kind of our hypocrisy. And so in the same way that I would say, yeah, I don't want there to be, I mean, I'm not, I'm not sure I'm super comfortable with there being a cathedral, when a national cathedral, when I take students to DC, sometimes we go to the cathedral, although we typically don't now, because it's way out of the way, and all that kind of stuff. But it's just, it's just a weird experience. There's just as a side note, by the way, there's several gargoyles on the National Cathedral, a whole bunch of them, and you can look up the Darth Vader gargoyle. There is actually Darth Vader's head is one of the gargoyles on our National Cathedral. Just if I have so many questions, just to let you know how seriously we take this whole religious thing at the national level. Anyway, and so I just, I like the idea of the church being safe from the state. I don't think the state is safe from the church, or ever should be fully safe from the church. But that's because the church, the state is not protected from anything really, in America, not much anyway. So just as a comment, I'm now outside online, can you all hear the gunshots in the background? Is that hitting our? No? Welcome to East Texas. I can hear it. Yeah, it's not, I don't think it's super distracting. I think it's good that we commented on it, though. Okay, good. So the crowd is out there. I'm okay. It's all right. I'm not, it's just a neighbor somewhere a couple of miles off firing off some old rounds, I'm sure. If it's like the other day, he'll be doing it for the next nine hours, but we'll, so hopefully it won't be quite that long. Oh, exciting. Anyway, you retire. Yes, exactly. So here's the deal. I want to read the controversial part of her statement. And I think it'd be worth for us to do that. And again, what we're, if we're picking on anything, I hope we're not picking on anything, but if we're picking on anything, it is the recognition that we need to be aware of the dangers of integrating politics and faith. Again, I have no problem with her calling out, with her calling out the political power in the name of Christianity or in the name of God, which she does in those exact verbiage. I think the danger though is, is her expression of Christianity is not, so everybody knows, traditional Christianity. It's a liberal, a relatively modern liberal expression of it, at least parts of it are. Now she certainly it is, but like this is not something that that we should assume the apostle Paul or the Jesus Christ would have agreed with everything she says. It's our responsibility to evaluate that, meaning each of us as Christians. But I think, I think hearing it and notice the, what I consider, and again, you guys know, our listeners know, I would unhesitatingly call this out no matter what side of the political aisle she was on, because I think this is what's, again, as a podcast is trying to help people not deconstruct, I actually think when we integrate politics in religion, we steal the power for sure of religion, if not of both. And I don't want us, politics is kind of a joke, and I don't want us turning religion into an equivalent joke, if that makes sense. So let me make one final plea, Mr. President, millions have put their trust in you, and as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. So far, so good. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children, and Democrat, Republican, and independent families, some who fear for their lives. The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor in poultry farms and meat packing plants, who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals. They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. I'm intrigued by her definitions there, but they pay taxes and are good neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues, Garudawaras, I think that's Hindu if I remember correctly, and temples. I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here. Our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to the stranger for we are all, we were all one strangers in this land. May God grant us the strength and courage to honor the dignity of every human being, to speak the truth to one another in love, and to walk humbly with each other and our God for the good of all people, good of all people in this nation and the world. Amen. There you go. That's great. Why does she end up with amen? I'm confused by that. I don't, I, there's several things. So as a preacher, that's how she wrote it. There's several little things that, that I could easily like, I would take issue with, like, the way she weaves scriptures together that don't go together. Yeah. Or modernizes them or in some ways, like, in my mind, that's kind of clumsy, or in a not very specific. But again, if I was, if I thought of the Bible as just a book of wisdom, maybe I would feel okay with doing that too. Right. But it's just wisdom here and there or whatever. Anyway, that's a, you know, afterwards, they told, she told the New York Times, she quote, wasn't necessarily calling the president out, which I think is, is dishonest. Honestly, that feels a little dishonest to me and authentic. Yes, she was. She actually started it, calling him out by, you know, focusing him. But making a plea because of fear she had seen among immigrants and LGBTQ plus communities. She wanted Trump to be mindful of people who scared. And so, and her last thing was, I was trying to say the country has been entrusted to you in one of the qualities of a leader is mercy, which is excellent, because she is right. That is one of the qualities of a leader. And it is one of the qualities of God. I think probably she might at the expense of the full character of God over emphasize one characteristic and that is mercy. It's not that God is less mercy in certain settings and others. It's that he is also righteous and just. He also believes in legal justice and portrays it. But oh yeah, go ahead. Well, I'll say one more, which is, I also really struggle with, and I've heard this language quite a bit, especially on the left when I've read them and they talk about the sojourner. And by the way, she is absolutely right in the Old Testament. There were very specific laws for protecting immigrants and sojourners, and they were extraordinary. I mean, the level of, of kindness and gentleness and generosity that the Hebrew people were to have with sojourners. And she's right that the passage tells the Hebrew people you should be this way because once you were sojourners, and which is a great message. I don't know that she can directly apply it, although I think even for Americans, there's something directly applicable about that. We were the, at one point, the immigrants. And so again, that's not bad. I don't fully understand people who don't have documentation, people who come illegally into America not being criminals. And that seems like an interesting use of the word criminal. So they are in direct violation of the law, but they're not criminals. Maybe there's a different meaning of the word criminal that I don't understand. Like they're not violent criminals, but doesn't criminal just mean in violation of the law? Maybe I'm missing that. But to me, it seems like they are criminals. And I don't mean that as a, I mean that as a technical sense, not as a, I mean, I'm a criminal too. So it's not like I don't mean that to pick on anybody. But anyway, I think probably the biggest trouble it seems, and I'm curious, you all thought is the lumping in of the LGBTQ community into the passages about the passages and the teaching about sojourners and immigrants. And I think that confuses some issues for people. It certainly does for me. Anyway, other thoughts? My first thought is maybe you should go check on your neighbor. I can hear he's only hitting about one shot in four. So he may need some target practice. He needs to be practicing because I can hear the blink when he hits the target and they're not, it's not common enough. If people are not from East Texas and listening to this, this is going to be very funny to them. Yes. It is not out in the woods, outside the city limits. This is not particularly strange for me. So my neighbors were shooting at 1 a.m. two nights ago. Oh, fun. Yeah. I was like, Mason was like, it's probably like a rancher or a farmer. And I was like, oh, right. I live here. I should know that. Turns back over, goes back to sleep. Exactly. I mean, yeah, I didn't even give it that much thought before now. So I think this is really great, really great food for thought, Chris, because it's like it's taking on several different things. I know obviously, I feel like the biggest political, you know, political, maybe politically charged thing is when you talk about lesbian, gay and transgender children. That probably, I mean, just gets a lot of people's blood boiling really quickly. You know, I'm just I'm just even thinking, yeah, like, because I don't I don't have an answer or really even a response to, you know, why, or even a thought of like, why would she put those two things together other than the fact that it's like, yeah, what do you what do you define a sword sojourner? You know, are you are you taking certain liberties there? And he said it's because they're both what they have in common is that they're both afraid. Oh, yeah. So it's all everybody. And that doesn't that's not a good moral standard. It's good I think it's great that she was, I guess, letting him know they're afraid. I suspect he knows that. In some cases, he probably desires that. But because he wants people to be afraid of breaking the law, as Romans 13 says, there is a law, and the state carries the sword for a reason. And one of its jobs, one of the few jobs of the government as a spouse to Scripture in Romans 13 is the is the protection against enemies. But so I think that's part of it. I think I think it beats I think it's a fair because I think it is a debate. I think it is an actual honest debate that Christians can and should be having as to how we treat immigrants. What does that look like in our country from a Christian worldview? I think is a very fair question. And it's very difficult in a non-theistic government system to know how to answer that. Right. So what it says in Leviticus, so Leviticus 19, let me read it 33 and 34 says when a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress or mistreat him. But the stranger who resides with you shall be to you like someone native born among you. You shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the lands of Egypt. I am the Lord your God. So God's standard for his people was once someone's there, you do treat them with loving respect. I mean, like as if you were loving yourself. It's an extraordinary level of of love. At the same time, that that is not equivalent to immigration policy at the government level. Right, right. So do you let everyone in? Should you let everyone in? Like that's it's a more complex question. But and this is Leviticus. If anyone is capturing this as representing the character of God, it's going to be the church, not the state. Right. If it applies to us, because often in the liberal side of things, they love to point out how teachings from the deep Old Testament don't apply to us. And they're right in a direct sense. So like this one is a good one to apply to us. But Leviticus, literally, this is Leviticus 19. Leviticus 18 condemns homosexual behavior. Right. And so it's like, okay, so Leviticus 18, we throw out because it has no application to us today. Leviticus 19, we should apply. And as Christians, we have not the opposite, right? We need to not do the opposite and say Leviticus 18 applies, but Leviticus 19 doesn't. And so we need to learn to have a cohesive hermeneutic. And if that word is new to you, go back in our podcasts, because we have about a million episodes that deal with hermeneutics various ways, because it's where most people get off base. So I think I think it's a worthwhile I think it's a debate Christians need to be having. And what we're trying to do is love the immigrant, because that I think is a safe thing for us to do. Anyway, well, and to love. I mean, this goes back to something we've talked about a lot of like, if you don't have like you're saying, if you don't have a good hermeneutic, but also if you don't have a good understanding of the character of God and how all of those like true pieces of him can be accurate at the same time, like it is going to be hard for you to make sense of Christianity in the Bible, because, you know, it's like, oh, well, he's merciful and he's, you know, kind, and he has compassion, all these things. And because you don't have an accurate understanding of God, it's like, therefore, he can't be these other things, because you don't understand how they fit together. You know what I'm saying? And so then it distorts your view of Christianity, because, you know, there's no space for a God who can love someone and say you're wrong, just like, you know, and then therefore, his people can't be that way, obviously, you know what I'm saying? And so it's like, there's so many underlying theological problems when you veer from like a good hermeneutic, and then also a good understanding of who God is. And then and then all you can do is take Scripture as, you know, advice or wisdom or whatever, because if you take it as authoritative, it no longer like, you can't make all of it work in your mind if you don't have those two things. And so it's like what we've talked about before of like, then you're left with an either or type of Christianity of like, well, either, you know, we love people and accept them and affirm all their choices. And that's the Jesus that we see in the New Testament. And then you have to change how you view Scripture. Or you view it as like, oh, you know, Scripture authoritative, God says things that sometimes I don't like. And also, he calls us to kindness. And what does that mean? I don't know if that makes sense. But it's yeah. Yeah, it's hard when you veer from that. And I think it's at the end of the day, it's like, we are all tempted to try to make Christianity comfortable for us and fit with what we believe, like you were saying, right. But there's a lot of danger in that. And a lot of times it breaks down really quickly. Yes. Yeah, that's I think that's huge. I think that's good. And I think that's so I would encourage Christians as our last episode, I don't know when this one will fall, but the last episode that fell was about Christians overreacting as the Christians probably shouldn't overreact. I, you know, I'm not always that much of a Donald Trump fan in various senses. There's a lot to work through with him. But I thought it was fascinating that he was his response was like, yeah, they probably could have done better. And then he just kind of moved on like he, he didn't seem to make a huge issue unless I missed it. And I easily could miss it. He did say some things about her. But go ahead. Oh, he did. Okay, I didn't see that. But it was like, they could do better than her was essentially all I saw. And so maybe maybe there's much more to it. So if he didn't overreact, good for him. If he did, well, bummer, that's more typical. But yeah, so anyway, I would I would say let's not overreact as Christians to it. At the same time, what I don't want to happen is on from either side of the political aisle that we somehow encourage people to see religion as no more serious than they see politics, to see faith is no more serious. And so we're we need to go back to the message of testing everything and keeping that which is right. I want to look that up. And that is really great. Which is maybe sure I've got the exact right term right passage first Thessalonians 521 and 22 test everything carefully, hold firmly to that, which is good, abstain from every form of evil. So I'd encourage Christians like when you see something like this, one, you don't you can react or not to your social media friends who are posting, you know, evangelicals always always react badly when someone teaches explains the actual teachings of Jesus. Well, that's not that's not true. And it's amazing how often someone who probably knows essentially nothing about the actual teachings of Jesus is happy to post that mean. Right. I have several social media friends who are very quick to tell me what Jesus actually said, and what Jesus actually says and what Christianity actually is, etc. And so I'm like, wow, okay. That's, yeah, someone who doesn't believe in any of this study, any of this or look into it, you seem to feel very confident that you're the one who gets it. So anyway, that is really interesting. Yeah. So okay, that thank you for commenting on that, guys. I think I'll be curious, you know, if you're listening, if you have a thought, please send in your thought. We'd love to hear it that that being said, we did get a thought from a listener. Bring can I throw that over to you? And maybe we talk a little bit. It was a Yeah, I'll just throw it over to you. And then you can kind of tee it up. And then we can have that conversation from there. Yeah, I'll try to make it brief. Yeah, it sounds good. So got a listener question from Chad about a podcast that he listens to. And he wanted to hear our thoughts on it. And I think there's some interesting things that we can pull from it. So I'm going to reference the podcast. He, he was just saying, Hey, this is an episode that I heard that had some, you know, controversial thoughts about purpose in it. And when you say sad, you mean Chad, too. It's a one of our church members and friends. I never know. Thank you for clarifying. I never know if people want us to say their last name. Well, that's great. Go for it. Sorry, keep going. Listener Chad, which I I can't there's no way to go from here. Go for it. But the podcast is called rich and regular. It's by Kirsten and Julian Saunders, which I don't know a ton about them. But I know they deal heavily with finance and do a lot of financial things. But then also have guests on their podcast. And their guest was Dr. Jordan Grummet, I believe his name is. And he's like a medical doctor who also is a podcaster and has delved into a lot of different avenues and now has written a book on purpose. And an interesting piece of it is he primarily doesn't practice medicine a ton anymore other than in a hospice setting. And so some of the questions that they were asking him was about what he's learned that he poured into his book from hospice. And so it was an interesting episode. He there's there's a I feel like he was all over the place and his definitions of what it means to find purpose in your life. He's not a believer. And so, yeah, I have a lot of just general thoughts, but a couple that I would love to at least circle back to by the end that I think are very relevant to what we talk about on this podcast. And one of those being can't do we think that or yeah, do we think that misplaced purpose can cause deconstruction? So how does where and how you find purpose? How does that intersect with Christianity and deconstruction? So that was one question that came to mind listening to this. And then is finding purpose meaning is fine words is finding purpose subjective? Because I think the interesting piece of this is he he basically I'll try to summarize a little bit of this and then Chris, you can jump in if you want. But he basically summarizes purpose in two categories, one being big P purpose, meaning like big grand ideas of purpose, more the idea of what he views as Christians view of purpose of like, there's one purpose for people. There's one goal that you should be striving towards. And then small P purpose, meaning like we find meaning and happiness in a lot of different ways and small things throughout our lives and what those are different for each of us. So we kind of divide purpose in those two ways. And an interesting kind of thing that we can unpack is his view of Christianity, or religion is more accurate. Religion in general is that having a single purpose, like a big P purpose is harmful to people because of like psychologically what it does to them. So I have a lot of thoughts, but before I move on, is there anything else you want to add to the intro? Chris, just initial? Well, it's kind of funny, I was listening to it chuckling. So sex and marriage has now been out closing in on a year. And Mark and I started working on my second book, identity and intimacy or intimacy and identity. I don't know what order it'll be in yet. And I've been teaching an identity class to students for the last 18 years every year. And so I was immediately struck by the oversimplification of his purpose ideas. And I was like, Oh, gosh, like, I feel like he had a cool idea. And it's like he found a really cool brick and maybe two or three really cool bricks. And he's like, he's trying to build a house out of all three out of three bricks. And it's like, okay, he's not wrong that what he uses some weird language, like he uses agency in a weird way, he defines meaning as separate from purpose, meaning, which he probably should use the word interpretation, which is not a bad synonym for meaning, is how we interpret our past. That's meaning we gain meaning from reinterpreting our past, retelling stories from our past with a different moral. And so I wasn't a victim. And immediately was like, Oh, I can't wait for for counselor Chris. Yeah, he's not wrong how you interpret your past. So your past, this is one of the things we talk about. So in my setup that I've got, which by the way, I have a foundation, an arch for pillars, a ceiling and a capstone in the in the identity development that I work with. And so in each one of them, like, essentially, he has unpacked, he's trying to unpack what I call the foundation. And he that's hopeless, by the way, that's where he becomes hopelessly circular. He actually said that. At one point in the podcast, because I know it sounds a little circular. I was like, Yeah, there's a reason it sounds circular. It's because it's circular. Like you just you just talk to yourself in an absolute circle. And then you're like, Hey, that sounds a little circular. Like, yes, yeah, yeah, it does. And that's, that's the foundation, we all need an ultimate purpose, we need something that underlies our identity, fundamentally, and that's, that's going to be purpose. He tried to define that that's that's more than purpose purposes, maybe not sufficient, it's a foundation of identity. That's what it was purposes, present, according to him who you are in the moment. And then his it's it's the it's the old if he doesn't quote the Hobbit, he deserves to pay royalties. So the story the book The Hobbit, if you've not read it a long time, read it again and read it as an identity book. And the the because you're introduced to a Hobbit as there was a Holy ground, there was a Hobbit and it's Hobbits are defined very simply, like they're very simple folks. Comfort. Hobbits mean comfort. That's all it means. Hobbit equals comfort. But the end of the book, the dragon asks Bilbo, who are you and where do you come from? Which is the two questions this site this doctor is asking, who are you purpose? Where do you come from? Meaning, based on his, I would not use them that way. But that's how he uses them. And again, it's not bad. It's just probably oversimplified. Now we listen to a podcast, we didn't read the book, I want to be really fair about that. Maybe he maybe he has a much more sophisticated unpacking of this in the book. He's not wrong in that we do need to interpret our past. And but we need a foundation, a cap, as he would call a capital P purpose that does that. And so for example, for the Christian, that is the love and sovereignty of God. And so that when I see even the horrible things in my past, I can interpret that through the lens of God, God let me go there and he brought me through, no matter how horrible or how wonderful it was. And that gives it now to use the word properly, I think, meaning that gives it a healthy interpretation. So yeah, it allows us to say things like I was a survivor, not a victim. Now that is that is not new thinking, by the way, this is a lot of this is he's at least in the podcast, there was an interesting mixture of very old material that he wasn't giving citations for. And then a lot of psycho babble language, and that's when he gets circular. And so I was kind of appreciating it at the first when he was in the questions that they had. But but then they got trapped into the fact that this is just the most authentic person they know, and they love him. And, and they got stuck talking about the character and personality of each other, and have moved away from the main topics that that probably needed to be unpacked. But yeah, the idea of storytelling to ourselves, gosh, there's a value in that. But think of how easy that is to abuse. Especially if it is your main way of finding meaning in life, like he indicated, your only way of finding right, is to tell new stories to yourself about your past. Whoa, that can be super scary. Yeah. Yeah. So to answer the question, I diametrically disagree with him in the statement that we can't just have one purpose. Now, I guess maybe maybe now if we were talking on a podcast, I suspect he would change his language a little bit to agree. But so we do need a capital P purpose. And there needs to be one of those, if you imagine a pyramid is how it teaches you imagine a pyramid. And everything that motivates you all purposes are on the bottom. I just made scare quotes. People on listening can't hear that. But across the bottom of the pyramid, and then as you move things up the pyramid, as you move the base up the pyramid, there's room for less and less and less and less and less. There is in the end one thing, when everything else can be taken from you, there is in the end one thing. And that one thing is your primary motivator. It is your ultimate purpose. It is the foundation of your existence. If it goes away, you go away, or at least everything you've built up till that point goes away. And, and he's right that can't be I love the fact that he said it can't be family. It can't be parenting. But what he's unable to do is tell you what it can be or what it has to be. And so instead, he says, no, it needs to be several, several diffuse things. So we've got to have several poor pieces of foundation. And that's safer than having one poor piece of foundation. Agreed. Another option would be to have one solid, stable, square, safe foundation. And that's what not just religion, but true faith provides. Yeah. Well, and it does feel very tied to like, even your teaching, like when I've heard you speak about identity of like, people think there's freedom and your identity being created by yourself. And it seems like he's trying to do the same thing with purpose of like, no, like the only way that it can be a solid foundation is if I decide what my purpose is, you know, and it's not an external thing of like my even my kids, because that can be taken away from me. But then it's like, but speaking of circular, doesn't that mean if you created it, then it is not a strong foundation because you're the only one that it's resting on, like your decision. Right. And so that was, that was like a thought that I had. And and ties to those conversations of identity of like, yeah, the, the common thought is the most freedom comes from me deciding my identity and purpose. But then if you play that out, that is the shakiest foundation that you could found meaning or purpose on or identity or purpose on. So if you're making your own purpose, is it purposeful? Oh, yeah. Right. Does making your own purpose fit with your purpose or not? Right. So, yeah, that's when he got circular and he caught himself. Kudos. But he didn't change anything. He didn't go, wow, this is really bad because the book's already published. It's probably too late for that. But I think, I think there is a, in the midst of this, there is the issue that if you don't believe in a creator God and certainly a benevolent creator God, there isn't anything else. There isn't a foundation. There isn't an ultimate purpose. And that's what Dr. Craig, there's a really great debate, if anybody wants to go check it out, between Dr. William Lane Craig and I can't remember the woman's name. I'm totally blanking on the woman's name. And then, and now I'm blanking on the man's name too. The Canadian psychologist that every, the most famous man in the world right now. Jordan Peterson. Thank you, Jordan Peterson. And so the three of them debate purpose. And it is a bummer because the woman is completely out of her league in the situation between Dr. Craig and Dr. Peterson. And so, I mean, who wouldn't meet that? Peter's son, right? It is Peter's son. Yeah. I wouldn't want to be on the stage with the two of them. That's like a tall order for anyone for girl. Their entire conversation ends up being Dr. Craig saying, everything you said, Jordan is great and it lacks a fundamental purpose. And you can't create one on your own. You can accept one bestowed upon you, but you can't create one on you. I'm now paraphrasing. It's again, I encourage people to watch it, but you get the feeling that about the third round, the woman's like, I think I'm just going to stay seated. Y'all just keep talking. Like she now realizes I have no business being here. And again, like most of us wouldn't. But that ends up being the main conversations that Dr. Peterson is saying humans can manufacture a strong enough sense of identity on their own to be valuable. What I would say is, I actually think that debate is what started Dr. Peterson down the road of studying theism, because I think probably he actually realized at some point in the conversation, no, there isn't. And so, I give a lot of credit there, but it's, I think that's part of the problem is, it's not that what he says isn't like this, this podcast isn't psychologically valuable. We do need to evaluate our past. We do need to reinterpret our past. What does it mean? And when we get a new tool for interpreting it, we need to go back and reinterpret our past. And he's right. Happy people are able to reinterpret their past. Well, that's an important part of life satisfaction. None of that's wrong. Then also, we need to have something that motivates us now. That's bigger than just now. That's also correct. That's also correct. He's stuck where I get stuck in secular counseling when I'm counseling with a person who's not a Christian, who's like, I don't want to talk about the Jesus stuff or whatever. And I'm like, great, we won't. And then we get here. And they're like, okay, so what can I build my life on? Like, well, what do you think? And they start listing things. And as they list them, they realize, well, no, that wouldn't do it. Well, no, that could be taken from me. Well, no, that could fall apart. Well, no. And I'm like going, yeah, I wish I had some other ideas for you. I really do. I've tried really hard now for two decades. There are healthier and less healthier ones. Rage and anger is a worse foundation. That was Marilyn Manson. I wasn't born with enough middle fingers. And like, yeah, that's less healthy than there is no greater cause than peace. Like, okay, that's good. That's Ronald Reagan's. But it's like, but either one of those by themselves won't get you. Eventually, your ability to create peace will be taken from you. And certainly your anger and rage will destroy you. And so one way or another, eventually you're going to need something outside of yourself. Alcoholics Anonymous has known this for a long, long time. You need a cause that's bigger than yourself. And I know modern day AA has lost hold of that when they say really ridiculous things, like it can be God or Buddha or the doorknob. That's actually their line or the doorknob that you believe in. Like, well, that's dumb. The doorknob will not help you. Sorry. But not like I believe in God. The sentiment still stands. It's something outside of you. But it's interesting because like, well, it's like you're saying though, if you don't have that, then you are left with circular reasoning because I even like wrote down a couple of quotes from him. And on one hand, he says, you don't, you can't just find your purpose. You have to build or create it because people become angry when they lose agency of their life. So that's like one piece that he says. Then the next like section, he says, you can't achieve your way to being enough. You can't purpose your way to being enough. You know, you can't achieve purpose. And I was like, those both can't be true. I mean, that's, you know, but that's what you're stuck with of like, um, this is, this is, listen, this is part of why this podcast, people need something to remind themselves when you start deconstructing and you don't reconstruct their consequences for that. One of those is you're left with a pile of rubble and you can't like we always encourage people all the time that have deconstructed their faith that I'm like, okay, then what is the purpose of your life? What is your meaning? What is your purpose of existence? And usually they either say, oh, I don't know. I don't, I don't worry about those kinds of questions or some version of that, or they give me a circular answer. Well, I'm just trying to make the world a better place. Okay. Why? Like, okay. What's your motivation for that? Well, I don't know. I just guess I think the world should be a better place. Okay. Well, there you go. Like, well, those to a, a, a one plus one equals one every time. Like it's a circular question every time. And so there has to be something outside of us that, that speaks identity and purpose. Now, yes, it is our responsibility as living free souls to accept meaning bestowed upon us. And to evaluate the different options bestowed upon us for their value and truth value. But yeah, we, what I tell my students is God, yes, we are partially responsible to construct our identity, but we're going to have to do it out of the bricks that someone else gives us. We don't, we don't have the ability to create bricks. It's the old, you know, creating life in the lab question and, you know, the sign, the secular scientist says, okay, well, you start with some dirt and God says, no, no, no, no, no, no, get your own dirt. Right. Like, well, if we start with matter and like, no, no, I need you to get your own matter. Well, I'm there. I can't make matter. Exactly. So there's, there's always going to, this is not God of the gaps. We are always psychologically going to come back to the fact that bestowed identity that we accept or don't accept is the key. So from a psychological healthy perspective, this guy has a lot of good things to say. Yeah. But he runs into a dead end, circularly, you know, he runs into his own butt, making a circle. I do want to say, cause this kind of leads into my last question. I think on that note though, we, his comment about religion just confirmed of like any foundation that we have that is not based on, you know, that bestowed foundation identity from God is shaky and therefore can cause deconstruction because he was talking about, like I mentioned at the beginning, his view of religions, view of purpose, and he uses religion really broadly. So obviously, I mean, he's probably right about a lot of versions of religion. But I think it's helpful to talk about briefly because his view of what religious people think, where religious people think purpose comes from seemed like it was a works oriented. Total performance. Absolutely. Yes. Because he was saying it's really harmful when you view your life having one purpose because it creates perfectionism and an unattainable goal and therefore just puts you into like a spiral of anxiety. And I don't think he's wrong because that is the version of religion that a lot of people, most people subscribe to. Or at least here's what he hears. Yes. That's exactly which is not the biblical picture of religion. Let's clarify. Right. Right. It is not a works based works for for biblical Christianity works as a response. Right. I'm saying like all other religions and inaccurate Christianity. Yeah, but go ahead. Here's what he hears. The other part is missing, though, brand with that is whatever your purpose is, is your religion. And so he's going. Oh, it's a yet religion is dangerous for these reasons. Your real purpose should be happiness. Okay. That's then a religion. Your real purpose should be, you know, idealistic humanism. That's now your religion. Whatever is at the top of that pyramid, no matter what it is, that is now your religion. If it's not God, it's a bad religion. If it's not God, as he's revealed himself, it's a foolish religion. And that's what we've said so many times this podcast, you do need to deconstruct your religion. The God you were raised on may not exist. The Christ you were taught about, we might be atheists to him as well, because Jesus Christ would be an atheist to that version of Jesus Christ. Like, right, that that that is not the correct understanding. And so a lot of times what deconstruction is good, what the best thing about it is, it allows you to unpack Christ as he is. And then again, then you've still got decisions to make. But at least you're making decisions about the real person. And it's not as simple. He's not a man of the political right or left in the year 2025. He's he's not someone that that's if you can fit Jesus neatly into your political box, then you've missed somehow you've missed him. If you can fit him in any worldly box, you probably missed him. He's probably challenging you, no matter what your views are. In fact, I feel confident saying he is or you're just or you've got the wrong guy. So I feel like that was the short for the whole, yeah, different Jesus. Yeah. Therefore, it's like, oh, yeah, go ahead. So here's what struck me. So you guys will appreciate I got done listening to that podcast. And I thought this guy needs to read Ecclesiastes. And so he needs to take an incredibly wise man who had limitless resources to run an experiment. And the experiment is I'm going to see if I give that meaning, purpose, and value in anything under the sun, meaning anything other than God. And Solomon spends probably years of his life and what would be the modern version of millions and millions of dollars and tests everything he can think of in ways that this guy could never practice it. And most of us could never even try. We're like, Oh, maybe sexual make me happy. Listen, there's nothing you've done. Solomon didn't do with several people at once. And if you go like, well, education, well, okay, like picket, collections and resources and civic civic responsibility, all of it, Solomon tried all of it in ways that we can't even comprehend. And in the end, defeated said, it's all wind. Everything under the sun for all of its good value cannot give you purpose fundamentally. So anyway, I was like, we need to I need to mail this guy a copy of the book of Ecclesiastes and say, you know, try again, because in the end, Solomon's final answer to this is, it turns out at the end of the day, it is about fearing God. And by that he means respect. And it has to do with honoring God and doing what he says. And that's the only thing you can find ultimate value in. Well, I think it's a really good Colson, were you saying something? No, I'm I think that's really interesting. I think it's just a good reminder that like any even for Christians, if we it is really easy to misplace our purpose, like, you know, it's really easy to like you're saying to even take good things that God's provided, you know, those other smaller things that this guy was talking about in life and make them our purpose, meaning our religion instead of Jesus. And that is like a perfect foundation for deconstruction. Because when we realize that our logic is circular, or when those things are taken away or when, you know, name it, or when they fail. Yeah, then if we've associated those with God in our our main purpose in life, then that is going to create a lot of problems theologically and psychologically. So I think that's like a really good reminder, even for Christians, of kind of him describing things that have like, I think it's easy for us to unintentionally adhere to as Christians and just remember that nothing is a foundation for purpose other than what Scripture's laid out. And it's really easy for us to like twist that, even to being our own version of, you know, Christianity or purpose or whatever. Well, I'll definitely make sure to link those both the podcast, obviously, that listener Chad sickening, but then also the William Lane Craig conversation with Jordan Peterson. That was, I'm not cutting you off in my brain. Are you, are those all the questions that you had? Yeah, that's all my thoughts. I think that's good. Good stuff. Thank you listener Chad for sending that in. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, that was awesome. All right. And thank you guys. I appreciate it. And again, listeners, if you have any questions, send them in.
