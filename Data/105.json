We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined as always by my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. Hey guys, doing good. We're doing great. Amazing. Wonderful. Well, we hope you out there in the podcast universe. Oh, there's a little lag. There is a little. The funny thing is though, there really wasn't much of a lag earlier. Yep. So sorry, Bryn. But although all that say we are in the That's all right. Reaching out to you in the podcast universe. We're going to continue our conversation on deconstruction when it relates to apparent contradictions in the Bible. And so we know that there's a long list of those and we're trying to handle those conversations honestly. But then also bringing truth to those conversations. But before we jump into our next apparent contradiction, Bryn had a question concerning the hiddenness of God episode that she wasn't present for. So, Bryn, can I throw it over to you and you hand us that question and then we'll move from there. Yeah. Yeah. And if there is a little delay, I apologize. I'm not at my normal recording location. Yeah. So I listened to that episode and really appreciated the conversation. This is something that I have actually heard is one of the main questions that people have currently. Like when it comes to deconstruction, a lot of times, and I can't remember who I'm quoting, but they were saying that of all the individuals they've interacted with who have been deconstructing, two of the main topics that are hardest for people right now is questions of morality. So a lot of times questions around sexuality and what the Bible says, and then what God is asking. And then the other one being the hiddenness of God. So I'm really thankful that you all covered that because it's a question that's come up a lot. But I think after listening to it, one of the questions that I had was when it comes to what we call the hiddenness of God or however you want to define it, the challenge of feeling God's presence, hearing from Him. I was thinking back to Genesis when it talks about the garden and how God walked with Adam and Eve and communed directly with them. And then after sin, they immediately went into hiding and basically hid from God. And so it broke their relationship with Him, their relationship with each other. And He says, I have to go back in Genesis, but doesn't God say, why are you hiding? I'd have to, I need to pull it up. But basically they're, but they're hiding from God. And so my thought with this hiddenness question, I think it is complex, but part of it is, do you think that a lot of times it's a perceived hiddenness that really is a result of sin in our own life and just that broken relationship? So it's not that God is making it hard for us to, or making it a lot of work for us to commune with Him. It's that sin has broken that relationship and created that division. And then also because of our sin, we choose a lot of things that push us to not invest in our relationship with the Lord, to hide from Him, to hide from the provisions that He's put in place for us to be in close relationship with Him. That, yeah, that's kind of what I've been rolling around in my head kind of thinking through. You think that's a big part of this hiddenness conversation? Yeah, I think that's a really good point. And it isn't the direction we naturally went because we were really focusing on God's hiddenness, that there is a sense in which God does not fully reveal Himself and why that would be. I mentioned Sunday about, we're talking about the charismatic people and how charismatic the devil must be and that kind of stuff. And just like that, the devil may crank up his charisma to 100% and humans certainly do every time we get, every tense we get, we crank up our charisma as high as we can. But how fascinating it is that God doesn't do that, that God doesn't crank up his charisma to full because if He did, no one would then have any freedom because His personality would overwhelm ours immediately. And it's intriguing that that's a gentleness in God to not overwhelm us with His presence all the time. Now, that being said, yeah, I think probably sometimes there is something about God that is hidden. And I think sometimes we just have our eyes closed or our eyes covered. And I think that's a really good point, Bryn, that I think people close their eyes and then complain about God's hiddenness. I think that's a very real thing. Or they won't accept anything but what they already have in mind. They're angry or they're hurting or whatever. And so anything that would seem to defend the idea of a God who loves them, they're not interested in that input. Only information that then backs their resentment or their pain, that's what they look to, which again is understandable. But I think it's not the whole picture. But I even think in my own life, not even, I mean, we definitely make choices that are, you know, that we're aware of. But I also think like the effect of sin on the rest of me also impacts my ability to feel God's presence and commune with Him. So the fact that I am, you know, don't have a lot of patience or I'm a distracted person or I'm, you know, whatever it is like about being a human, I'm not able to pray for long periods of time. I want to do things in my own strength so I don't take my problems to Him anyway. You know, like all of these things about being a broken human, I know for me, they're, I mean, if I am not actively seeking to spend time with Him, it's like any relationship like we talk about. If I'm not actively seeking to spend time with Him, then yeah, I feel in His absence, but it's not that He's gone anywhere. It's like a result of my choices, not that I don't want to be close to Him, but I've chosen things that have created that separation. Does that make sense? Yeah, for sure. It's a, there is a sense that the personal relationship that, you know, I may say I want to have a close relationship with my wife, but if I'm flirting with other women or having relationships with other women, I am not going to have the same relationship or... We're just ignoring your... Yeah, yeah, even ignoring her. Yeah, exactly. Those are going to change that. You know, there's a famous old story that a lot of pastors tell about, you know, the old married couple driving down the road in a pickup truck and in front of them, they see there's a couple, you know, the bench seat and the old pickup trucks. They don't make those anymore, really, but the bench seats, they used to be in old pickup trucks and the guy is sitting behind the steering wheel and in this car, in this truck, there's some young couple and the girl is sitting right pressed up against him in the middle, not on the far right. And the wife turned, the old woman turns to her husband, she's like, how come we don't sit like that anymore? And the old husband says, I haven't moved. And that whole story is meant to connect to that exactly what you're describing. There are times we go, I feel like God's a long way. He's far away from me or he's distant from me. And God's going, I haven't moved. You moved and you went away from me and you ran from me or you're not interested in communicating with me or whatever. And so of course we feel more disconnected or less connected to anyone, including God, who we flee from or who we avoid or who we bear resentment toward that we're not willing to concede that. And so it's not an easy thing. I'm not saying that, well, so therefore stop feeling what you're feeling, but it is good to know this is probably what this is about. I think I've told you guys about, I had some really good friends. He was a pastor and she was a counselor and they had been praying for a baby. They had been unable to have a child, been praying for a baby for 10 years. And then she got pregnant and then they had a miscarriage. And they kind of in horrible grief called us and Ginger and I went to go spend the day with them. And at one point the husband is like, I don't doubt that there is a God, but I'm certainly not on speaking terms with him right now. And I think that's a natural emotional response. And we have to figure out, am I willing at some point to come back into relationship with this God who has disappointed me so badly? And am I willing to try and even willing to try to give the benefit of the doubt or am I insisting on seeing things through the worst possible light because I'm hurt or angry? And those are all good examples. Sometimes God is hidden, but sometimes that's a good point. God seems hidden because we have our eyes closed or our head covered. That's a good point. And even like sometimes it's immediate or my personal sin. And then sometimes I think it's just the brokenness of the world even of like, well, I get, when we're really tired, it's hard to spend quality time with God. So I don't feel his presence because I'm tired and distracted all day. You know, like those simple things that I think you could still argue are a result of the brokenness of the world, but not even a result of my immediate sin. So I think there's a lot of layers to it, but yeah, I agree. Yep. There you go. But anyway, that was just something I thought about. I think I definitely appreciate the path or the direction y'all took for that talk. But I also had just thought about that question because I think they both play into it. But yeah. Yeah. I'd be interested to talk with somebody who really struggles with that. I think that would be an interesting thing to see what are there any things that we didn't address that for some reason that's... So all that I'd say is if you're listening and you know of somebody that really struggles with the hiddenness of God, will you send me an email or text or something? And that kind of ties it. Bryn, were there any other questions that resulted from that or would you like to move on to the contradiction point that you had brought up? Yeah. That was my main thought from the episode. You want me to tackle the next one? Please. Okay. So we've been going through contradictions in Scripture, like you said, and the next one that I really wanted to cover is... I want to cover it for a couple of reasons. One, I think I found it on a list of contradictions when it comes to more principles of contradictions, not necessarily this verse says this word and this verse says this word, but more like this seems contradictory of an idea in Scripture, but it's also relevant to our theme of deconstructing and reconstructing because it has to do with doubt. And so I thought it would be helpful from the standpoint of contradictions trying to tackle those, but then also what does this mean for us being able to doubt? Because part of this whole podcast and the purpose of it is encouraging all of us to be honest about our doubts and to be open about those and to feel freedom to doubt and all those things. And so this impacts that a lot depending on the meaning of this verse. So James, it's from James 1 and James 1, I'm just going to read for context the paragraph. So James 1, 5 through 8, If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. So, and I'll just throw out my question. I've read James so many times, but then recently, I don't know if it's because I read this on an article that was talking about deconstruction, or maybe I just read scripture through that lens now. But I think it never hit me of like, okay, if you aren't really digging into this at face value, it seems like he's saying, you are not allowed to doubt. And if you doubt, basically you won't receive anything from the Lord. Yeah. So I mean, where I go from this, first of all, is what are the hermeneutics questions that we need to answer? Good. As we look into this. So do we need to quickly unpack who James is and who he's writing to? Sure. Why not? That's a good idea. So James is a general letter. James is the half-brother of Jesus, generally accepted. This is so meaning Joseph's and Mary's son, not God and Mary's son. So he's the half-brother. And James was not a believer of Jesus being the Messiah and the Son of God until after Jesus had died and resurrected. And so the church tradition is actually that he was one of those who came and mocked Jesus as being crazy. And yet at some point later realized the truth of it. And so that's significant for obviously we're talking about James. And then James writes this general letter. It's not to just one specific church. It's kind of two Christians in general. One of the things I love about James that's a lot of fun is that James is written in such a way that it very much so still is like weirdly and directly applicable. So like you read through James now and you don't go like, Oh, I don't know. I don't see how I can apply this. And so, you know, it's about things like not showing favoritism, keeping control of your tongue and your words, like making sure your faith and your practice look the same. Like clearly all things that we've mastered in the church and we no longer have any problems. Right. Exactly. No facetious. Yeah, exactly. So this is a, as we, as we unpack these and you know, we look at these, that's it is a very direct letter. James pulls no punches. He does not, he doesn't sugarcoat anything. And that's part of why what's interesting is a lot of young Christians, inexperienced Christians, this is by far their favorite book because it doesn't require as much hermeneutics to figure out how to apply it. It's like you read it and you're like, well, that could have been written to me today. Right. I don't need to know the context. I get it. Yeah. I need to do this. But you're right. It is, it's good to understand that, know who we're dealing with. And so he's, he is writing this general letter. And it is to all, essentially to all believers. And he starts right off the bat with general practice. So he doesn't dive into the theology as much like Paul does. This is like the second half of most of Paul's letters. So the first half is theology. And then the second half is practical application. James skips all the theology part and goes straight. I mean, literally verse two is how we should, we should be rejoicing in our trials because they test our faith. So faith is obviously a key theme for James right from the beginning is that faith produces the testing of our faith produces steadfastness and eventually those grow us up. And then he's going to compare that he's going to make a comparison between faith is what grows us. You know, faith, it's like, you know, faith has offspring and the offspring are the testing of our faith is steadfastness. Steadfastness as it continues to grow, creates a sense of completion in us a purpose in us. So there were lacking nothing, right? Right. And then verse five says, so he uses that word lacking so that you're lacking nothing. Now, verse five, now, if any of you have what you're lacking is wisdom. So in other words, you're not there yet, right? You have not reached that completion. You're still lacking something. For any of you, it may be wisdom that you're lacking. Well, what should you do if you're lacking wisdom? You need to ask God because God loves to give wisdom. He loves to give it generously. There's no reproach in the way he gives it to you. And God will give you wisdom. And I think one of the things you've got to watch out for in this passage is that James is talking, he's being very clear with his language. What he's talking about is asking for wisdom. So that's that's his, that's the thing here. If you're asking for wisdom, so if you go to God and you pray for wisdom, make sure verse six, let him ask in faith. So let's go back. You guys remember from when we studied the book of John, what the Greek or the early Christian concept of faith was? Is there is our silence indicative that we don't remember? I think I think silence is indicative that you don't remember. Pistos is the Pistos, the Greek word here is means to be convinced, to be persuaded. Oh, right. And so the job of the Christian is to essentially let yourself be persuaded. That's the job of anyone is to let themselves be persuaded by the truth. Any barrier that we have to being persuaded by the truth, we need to get it out of the way so that we can be persuaded by the truth. It's an action in the Greek often, it can be a noun or a verb in the Greek. In the English, it's only a noun. We don't faith things. So we usually use the word believe and believe is not, I think in the modern English is not a good, because people think of belief as passive like, oh, I guess I believe that. It's not, well, make yourself believe it if you don't. Not open yourself up to belief if you don't, but in there for them, it was this action concept. Interesting. So there we go. So as we're unpacking it, so if you're asking for wisdom, make sure you ask in faith without doubting. So this is a really big Greek word. Doubting. Yeah, the doubt, the word for doubting here, let me put on my glasses. I probably still can't pronounce it. Diacrineomenos. Diacrineomenos. Somebody out there who knows if my nephew Andy is listening, he's cackling right now, my bad pronunciation. Come on, Andy. But this is a, it literally means to tear apart or to break apart, to make a distinction. So for example, the first one for doubt, which one? Okay. So for example, a root, an example is like someone in 1 Corinthians 11, there's the language, because someone who does not distinguish the body of the Lord from ordinary bread, and that word distinguish is the same root. Is it the same root as that? Uh-huh. It's a similar word to the word discernment. So discernment has a similar language in it. So there is a good version of this discernment and a negative version of this, which is doubting. And they're not identical, but they have some similar roots to them. So faith with no doubting for the one who doubts, same word, is like, and so I think this is really interesting. I think what we're about to see is the type of doubting that James is referring to. So I don't think he means all doubting is bad. I think he's saying particularly, if you're asking for wisdom and you have this kind of doubting, you're not going to receive anything, which is interesting because the type of doubting he's about to describe is the exact opposite of wisdom. So wisdom is to see as God sees or to understand as God understands, which is God never is wrong about things. So God doesn't change his mind when it comes to facts. He may change his mind relationally with people because we're mercurial, but when it comes to the facts, God's not going like, well, today two and two is 17. Or today this is not a sin versus it is a sin, like that kind of thing. And so we see this play out. The one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed. That's an interesting picture, isn't it? So to be driven by the wind is literally the word for tossed there, to be driven by the wind. So King James actually puts a play on words here and it says, if I think it's King James, let him ask in faith, not wavering. Oh, interesting. Is how it says that's an intentional play on words. Now the word doubt doesn't mean wavering. It means to divide it into pieces, typically, to divide this from that. I'm still dubious. I don't trust it. So God's giving me wisdom, but I don't trust it. I don't believe that he can give me wisdom. I don't believe that he will give me wisdom. And instead what I'm being is someone who's tossed to and fro. So this is all dependent on my mood or my emotional status. And so someone who asks under that heading, like, listen, I'm asking God for wisdom, but the truth is I'm depending on my emotions and my mood more than I am trusting in what God reveals to me. Now you can see why James would go, that person is going to get no wisdom. Right. I mean, absolutely. Because it's like, yeah, there's, are you even going to accept it at that point? Yeah. Well, and it's, I think I read a commentary or I read a commentary. I think it was by David Guzick, but, um, but he was saying that like the word double minded means to sold, I guess, like the Greek word means die. So, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, verse eight. Yes. So maybe, did you just say that maybe, no, I didn't, but it's, it's die. The word is die to psychos. Um, psyche means soul. Oh, perfect. Mind. So he, he, he was just saying the commentary was pointing out that, you know, a lot of times when we just see doubt, we think like, Oh, I, I'm authentically wanting wisdom, but I'm wavering back and forth as if God can give it. But instead like the two sold me is what you're saying of like, I actually don't, I'm not all in when it comes to the Lord and what I'm asking of him. I kind of don't, I kind of want his wisdom and I kind of want my own wisdom. I kind of want, it's like a wavering, not of like, Oh, do I believe in, do I not believe it's like a genuineness of the ask is what, how I interpreted that. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay. I also, I also think there's an interesting little detail here that I don't like now again. I'm so not a Greek scholar and probably someone has written a PhD paper on this, but the word that person must not suppose he will receive anything from the Lord. I, I, I, that word, anything, um, T it's just, it's just a T and an I or a tis or whatever. It, it can mean anything, but it can mean a certain thing. And it can mean one thing or the exact opposite of it. And, and it's something, it's like, it can mean somebody, it can mean anybody. It can mean someone. It can mean, uh, anyone. It can mean any man or any woman. Um, it's all, it typically is the word any, like that's its most common meaning is any. So of course that's what you put in here. Only contextually would you go certain things, but I feel like the context here almost calls for that. Like it's saying, if you ask for wisdom and you do it doubting, you will not receive anything. It seems to be like the point he's making is you will not receive wisdom. You will not receive something. And so that's the whole point. That's, that that's like, I don't know if James intends for this to be now, listen, if you, if you ever pray for anything and you doubt, you'll never get it. And I don't, I don't think that's James's teaching here. I don't think that's what he's trying to teach is that because he's specifically teaching about prayers for wisdom. He just talked about lacking nothing. And that if the thing you lack is wisdom, you should ask. And if you ask, you should ask for wisdom, not double mindedly, not like, well, you know, I do want wisdom, but I really don't want it kind of reminds me of those people who talk about whatever you do, don't pray for patients because then, you know, God may, may put someone in your life to teach you patience. Like that's, that's a perfect example of double mindedness. Well, do you want patience or not? Well, I mean, not if it costs me something, right? Okay. So then you don't want patience. So you're right. You probably shouldn't pray for patients because you don't actually want any patience. Um, if you really wanted to be patient, force you to learn patience. Exactly. Like he's not gonna, if you're asking for something, like, you know, you still have to choose to like, allow him to sanctify you. Right. I mean, he can force it, but he just almost never does. It's just like, right, right. He's like, yeah, exactly. That he's, he's partners with, he lets us be a part of that process. It's the old, but he's not going to force you to be godly. Right. Yeah. Apparently he's not. Um, and so I think that's a, I think that's really what's going on here. And so it's it to me, as many places as we have in scripture where people do pray and doubt, where people do pray and that they do so imperfectly where they pray and they're just, you know, they start their prayer as I do too. Sometimes my prayers begin with God, if you're there, I don't think God's like, Oh, well forget it. Right. Okay. You just broke my rule. One, God knows if I'm doubting, even when I do pray for wisdom. Um, and he's right. I should probably, I should be more disciplined so that I'm praying in faith, not in doubt. Um, but, and here's the last thing that always got me with this is here's what I love. So in the midst of all of this, all the different ways I can show that I don't think this teaches that you won't receive it. If you doubt, you won't receive anything is this. It doesn't even say that verse seven says for that person must not suppose he will receive anything. In other words, if you're asking doubting, well, God may give it to you. He may not, but you certainly shouldn't expect it. You shouldn't. If you're, if you're all over the map with your moods and with your feelings about like, I want, I want God to give me wisdom, but man, if he makes me, if he asks me to change something in my life that I don't want to change, like I want God to give me wisdom. Okay. Well, I read the Bible that I should probably not be dating this nonbeliever. All right. Well, I don't like that one. So I'm going to, I'm going to move a little, I'm going to just move along. I don't really want God's wisdom. If it requires something of me, well, then you should not suppose that God is going to get you in the, he's not going to cram it into your brain. Like the matrix, it's, it's a, you're double-minded. You don't really mean this. You're not really following us. And so no, you're probably going to walk away with nothing. Now you may, you ask God for healing and you do it doubting and God may heal you. You ask for anything and God might, but you probably ought to be a little dubious of yourself as well. If you're going to doubt him, you probably ought to doubt you as well. You shouldn't suppose God's going to jump through some hoop in the midst of your dubious, dubiousity. Is that a word? I doubt it, seriously. It is now. But I think in a culture that where personal gratification is so important and almost worshiped in our own life, and then, then you get kind of the health and wealth movement, I think this is pertinent to that conversation as well. You know, of like, if I'm trying to make God into something that He is not, and I'm trying to be like, well, this is about me. And so it's not like you were saying, Chris, if I'm not, right? If it's, if I'm living in direct opposition or antagonistic toward what the Bible says is true, then according to this passage, if we're reading it like that, well, then we shouldn't suppose that we would, we would be getting that thing we were asking for because it's like, but yeah, because of being, being double-minded. Yes. Am I saying that correctly? I think so. I really think, go ahead. Go ahead, Brandon. You go first. Well, I was just saying, yeah, it makes sense to me of like, even from the perspective of like coming to God and asking Him for things, but then, you know, not wanting all of that relationship with Him or all of His word, it's like, Oh yeah, give me wisdom, but then I'm going to take the pieces of it that I want. Yeah. You know, I don't know. That's, that's what I. Yeah. And I think the person, that person should not expect to be any wiser after that exchange. Or, or when my child, I guess comes and asks me a question, but then they just leave or they don't answer, you know, it's like, they don't wait for the answer. I don't know if your, your kids do that or have done that as they were growing up, Chris. Yes. But it's like, yeah. Okay. I'm going to ask you a really like, and I'm like, Oh man, this is great. Ask me a, you know, a life question or so. What does this mean? And then it's like, and then they just walk off or something. I'm like, constant. Oh, I, I guess you don't want to know. Yeah, exactly. You know? And so I wonder if some of it is too of like, you can ask, but if, I mean, do you really want to know God, God weighs your heart. God knows where you're at. Right. Right. But it's not just like, Oh, well, I'll just pray this random prayer and I'll get wisdom. Yes. I don't know. I don't think it has to come with that. Right. Yeah. I actually at a marriage conference I was doing this weekend, we were, we, one of the stories that came up that was kind of funny was about the husband, his wife asking where they should go eat and him being like, well, where do you want to go eat? And she's like, I don't, I don't have any idea. I don't, I don't, I don't know. And so he goes, well, we could get Mexican. She's like, no, no, I don't want to get Mexican. And they do this whole conversation like that. And you're like, and this is what he's asking. Like, why did, why did you ask? I would love to know. Could we go back to the original question? I'd love to be at least understand the motivation for why you asked me. And I actually got to explain it to him that it has to do more with helping her organize her thoughts and, and, and to figure out what she really wants and all that kind of stuff. And that it really can be valuable, but still it's like, yeah, God, what would you have me do in this situation? Well, my word speaks clearly to it. And here's the spirit's guidance. And I mean, anything but that, what else you got? A special word for me. Exactly. Can I get something different? Anyway, interesting. Yeah. Actually, an angel appeared to me and told me that I can disobey God's word. That's exactly right. That's right. And also we're having Mexican food. Exactly. And we say this so many times, but I think it's worth mentioning. I think all this once again, goes back to the character of God, where it's like this verse, which is why we're digging into it, but this verse seems to say, you know, if you read it a certain way, Hey, you can't doubt. But then you see like God's patience with his people throughout the whole Bible of like, um, you know, Job and all the different people who are wrestling, uh, Thomas and, you know, just people who have wrestled with questions. And he is so patient with them. And, um, you know, which is it Elijah or Elisha, the one who, um, once he goes to the cave, Elijah, where, um, he's, yeah, he goes to the cave yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. And he just is like, just saw God work in so many ways and then is struggling with probably doubt of some kind because he, it seems that he's depressed. And anyway, just like seeing God's patience over and over and over again with his people and yes, calling him to calling them to his word and what he's told them, but still kindness and, and bearing with them, you know, and then scripture saying that he is the same yesterday, today and forever. And so just going back to the character of God saying, even if this one verse seems to say like, Hey, you're not allowed to doubt at all. That's not, um, we have to look at the big picture once again of the character of God and, and the picture that scripture is painting of him when it comes to us wrestling with him and our ability to do that, you know. I think that's a great point. Did you have an additional point, Chris? Well, I think, I think what struck me too was it's, we do want people to know that of course we doubt. And even if it is not a good idea, it's sometimes too doubt. That doesn't mean we're not sometimes going to. And so, you know, to, to pretend like you're not doubting is not an improvement over doubting. Um, and so to, to wrestle with it, I think is a good thing, but let, I think this could be an encouragement to people that when, that when people say, um, like there's this passage in the Bible and it causes this huge problem for me to go, okay, well first I really, really want to encourage you to go actually look at that passage and really dig into it. Um, cause I think that's a, so often that is an issue, um, that, that you, when you actually stop and look at the passage and you go, wait, this, this doesn't, even this doesn't say that if I, that if I don't, if I ever asked for anything and I doubt God won't give it to me, like none of that is here. There's ways that you can understand why people feel like, oh, this is saying I better not doubt. Okay. But, but what's going to happen? Like every step of it needs to be engaged with to see does it, does it say that or not? And if it, if it doesn't, what is it saying and wrestle with that? Like it is a great thing to have to wrestle with what scripture actually says. And that's hard enough. Let's not make it say something else. And then have to wrestle with that.
