We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hey everyone, welcome to this edition of Reconstructed Faith. Our host, Colson, is not here, but Chris Legg and I are here and we're excited about another episode dealing with right now just evidences. We're in the reconstructing part of why we believe basic things like God. We've covered cosmological, argumentological, life itself, talked a little bit about science, and then today we'll at least cover one more on another good reason to think that there's a God. This is one of the ones you said you wanted to cover? To clarify from last week, you lean towards a young earth theory and so of course you hate science, right? Isn't that the obvious implication of that? No, not at all. Again, I think even what we were talking about ... You didn't know I was going to do that. No, no, no. Maybe I gave this example before, but if we're on the squad, the police squad, and the chief goes, hey, I want you to solve this crime, follow the evidence wherever it is, but just know it can't be anyone who's on the force. You would go, that's not fair. You're not being ... You are not able to follow the evidence wherever it leads. We're not being objective. Right, objective. I'm totally for science as methodology, like what is the best explanation and things like that. The problems that I run into is when people ... It turns into science as philosophy that you have to come up with the right kind of answers. We're not interested in truth. We're interested only in things that back up what our view is. That's where I think that science is great, but it's only a way of knowing and there's other ways of knowing including what you're going to talk about today. That's right. It's fascinating to me and in today's world it's become a huge problem. You would think, especially hard scientists would be the most opposed to this, but is the way the word science is being used as a causational force? What made that happen? Science made that happen. As if science is a causational force. That's like saying philosophy made that happen or religion made that happen. No, those aren't things. They have no causational power. Those are concepts. I love that the video we referenced, that's the funny video of the deconstruction. Oh, the Babylon being. Or the girl was like, I don't know if you've heard of this. I don't want to get too deep or whatever, but science, have you heard of it? She's like, checkmate. Exactly. As if that, just throwing science out there proves ... I thought that was well done. Again, it is a ... We've talked about the sources of knowledge and how empirical study is an important source of knowledge, is a vitally important one. Those of you who are listening I want you to notice if you listened last week and if you're more old earth like I am, but I want you to go back if you didn't notice that what Chris was referencing was evidence not just, well I don't care what the evidence says, this is what I've chosen to believe. To me, no matter where your perspective is on those ... I have a hard time respecting the lazy answer. I don't know much about the science, but this. Everyone says this, or but this is what the media presents, or this is the ... In my mind, that is poor science. The main people who should be offended by that is the scientific community, is to say, no, no, you're abusing our art. You're abusing our science. You're abusing us, our discipline. I think that's important and the discussion at the level of evidence, at the level of rationality, at the evidence of mathematics, and I enjoy being on the side of this conversation that is consistently deferring to this is the evidence I'm seeing, I am happy to have it explained away if you can do that either rationally or empirically or whatever. If you can help me understand where I'm wrong, I am happy to listen and happy to adjust what I believe. That's a fundamental belief of mine as well. I think it's funny that as I've gotten older, I'm more comfortable saying that. When I was younger, I think I was scared or felt threatened. Like I said, maybe because of how I was raised, but I'm more open to like, I could be wrong. I need to be convinced, but I'm not worried about it or threatened by it, I guess. I was in the weird, you and I were raised in an opposite perspective in that I was raised by this environmental scientist dad who was by far the biggest influence on me, but then also being around his colleagues and everything else, that for me, I had to literally stay quiet about my opinions about the age of the earth almost anywhere. If I referenced saying, I think it makes a lot of sense that the earth is older, that's the kind of thing that could get you in trouble when I was young at church, especially at church, but I went to a private school too for a while. Anyway, that's an intriguing conversation we're having. Again, I think part of what the value of this podcast is, is the recognition of it. It is okay to ask some of those questions and to engage in those conversations as long as you are doing it, honestly, and really digging into them. There are great men and women of God and science as if those, because we talked about is the search for truth is the search for truth and the truth would never contradict the truth. When one source of knowledge seems to contradict another source of knowledge, our understanding of at least one of them is wrong. It may be our scientific understanding is wrong, it may be our understanding of revelation is wrong. Like you mentioned, the word day, which if we interpret the word day to mean whatever it is, slightly less than 24 hours, which is the sun rotation and you go, that's and it turns out, no, it actually turns out in that situation, it's better to interpret it as a period of time. Okay, I mean, that's not painful for should not be painful to go, oh, bummer, I've always thought it meant 24 hours. But if a better understanding is it means it's an era, okay, I mean, it's, I can do that. And with the proper evidence, I'm willing to make that move. I just wonder, in all of this with people who have or are deconstructing, how many times that the issue of science or them thinking, well, if it's not this way, then I'm totally everything's wrong. Right. Like that they did this hopeful, he's freeing for them to be like, that was one of my main things is I felt guilty or didn't feel like I could hold on to my faith and what science was telling me. And so I had that, you know what I mean? Yes. I just wonder how many people there's a way to take a survey. It is it is it is bad enough for the naturalism, the science, the secular scientific community to demand that you choose between science and religion. God forbid that the church force you to choose between science and religion. That's not appropriate that science is utterly dependent upon the religious movement, there would be what we call modern science exists because largely of the church, the philosophy of the church, the mindset of an ordered universe that is all Western thought that proceeds largely from early Christianity and early Judaism like this. It is amazing to me that and I love I love getting to have the conversations with people about, you know, Isaac Newton, who I don't know if you've read Isaac Newton's commentary on Revelation and Daniel. Yeah, it's in the room somewhere with us like he was that serious a Christian is he wrote his own commentary on the prophetic books. But Galileo is a good example of the church being so scared of absolutely letting go of something that actually wasn't the idea that we're the center of the universe and center of the they just couldn't let that go and so therefore Galileo was wrong. Right. Oh, well, okay, let's look at what science is telling us. That's right. And we're not threatened by that, but they were they felt that's right. So it's it's really, you know, when they you know, the when you do a Mendel square and I don't remember his first name or where he's from, but you know, this is a monk, the whole concept of the our understanding of our fundamental understanding genetics. Now we have a much expanded version now, but comes from a, you know, a Christian monk, yeah, breeding. Remember correctly, it's pee pee plants or beans or something, whatever it was. And and like so clearly doesn't contradict Christianity or Scripture or Christianity or religion or even my favorite is the Occam's razor when because Carl Sagan, among others, loved to use Occam's razor as a you know, which which is more likely that an all powerful being created everything and left no evidence of himself, which by the way, is a contradictory self contradicting statement or or that everything came into existence by its own natural processes. Occam's razor says all things being equal. The simplest solution is typically the right one. I'm paraphrasing it, but that's Occam's razor. The man for whom Occam's razor is named was a monk and he considered it evidence for the existence of God. It was he considered it on the on the equation of like Pascal's wager. Yeah. That he said all things being equal, the simplest answer is usually right. And by far the simplest answer comes back to that there is a divine intentionality behind all these things. So I love when it to hear someone in that in the secular world quote Occam's razor to me and I'll have them like have you want you look that up real quick. I want you to Google Occam's razor and it's a great anyway. They're not in contradiction and we don't treat them that way. We're willing to have the conversation. All right. So now one of the other sources of knowledge is intuition. And rightly so it is treated as kind of the weakest of the sources of knowledge. That doesn't mean it is always a weak source of knowledge. It just means of all of them it's the least it's the least objective by definition. It's a subjective source of information. And this came to me my understanding of this. The reason I talk about this came to me when I was asked the question what would it take for you to not believe in God. And and I had a whole series of things like you know if this was proven or that was true but had a whole series that I would said would make it more rational for me to not believe in God or would mean the evidence points best towards there is no God. And I had to have a series of answers for that. Now that would not force me to not believe in God. I mean I can I'm a poker player. I can call when the when I know the odds are against me. I'm allowed to do that. I don't have to believe my odds of winning are better than losing in order to call a hand. Right. That being said I think these would be strong evidence is against so for example what would cause me not believe in God. That's tougher but what would cause me not be a Christian. Those are some very clear evidences. I mean if if you could find evidence that the body of Jesus Christ was discovered and found and there's good reason to believe that my theology would have to radically change. And that that's an example that's a proof a truth claim that I agree that at this stage it would be hard to contradict but it would not have been hard to contradict early on. We'll get there when we talk Christianity. Sorry I'm getting off. Here's but here's the intuition one. The intuition one is when you when you even if you did all those I don't know how you're going to convince me that things don't matter that I think matter. And that's what I don't I don't know how what it would take to convince me of that. When you listen to our conversation with David Smalley. I was going to go there. Yeah. Oh go ahead. Come in on know about his son. Yeah. Yeah. That well his response wasn't like I would and that's just the nature of the universe. People dying like he was really like tough and wrestling with it and we're sympathetic and that's right. Naturally do is we feel like something precious was lost right because there's meaning there and we don't just go oh yeah but you know. Survival the fittest like we don't know exactly throw that out there and that's not the way I think most people talk even if they don't believe in God they think that love is a real thing that they're experiencing or right. So that is the I loved it before before he came on he had sent me something saying I don't know for sure I'll be able to come because my dog needs surgery or something like that. And of all the things or an atheist you know to do is like you're getting you're paying to have your dog give your dogs I mean just get a new dog. I mean it's like what are you experiencing that you're assigning meaning to here. I mean because you believe you're assigning the meaning there is no abstract objective meaning here. The only meaning that exists is assigned by us. It is there is none outside of us and and that's what I would have to be pushed off of somehow you would have to convince me that my love for my wife is really just a deep desire to pass on my genetics. And we talked with him and we will discuss morality at another time and it you somehow have to explain morality within the midst of that that and I have decided not to try to pass along my genetics with as many females as possible even so something in me has committed. I mean I am committing I am risking genetic suicide by committing myself to one woman and on top of that I know you understand I'm raising two other men's genetic material as my own and they're going to pass along his genetic material not mine and yet I'm choosing to do that anyway. I have to believe that there is no meaning to my relationship with my wife beyond this delusional meaning of assigned and called love. That love is not real. It's just chemical stuff going on. That's right. It's just the desire to reproduce. It's about sexual preference. It's about whatever and that's all that it is and because if there is no soul there is no spirit there is no whatever then then only what we assign has meaning. And that my children my love for my children is nothing more than a genetic preference for my own genetics. What I call love for them is not it doesn't have it. That's just a delusional word. It's just a word that I've used to assign the biochemical reactions in my body that feel somehow positive that that that my body wants to reward me for feel for having this experience so that I'll have that experience more often so that I can pass on my genetics and and nothing more. My love for my children is not anything more than that. Yeah. What do you think as a therapist do you feel that contributes to a lot of people feeling confused or lost or even depressed like that if there's no objective moral meaning for me being here initially it sounds fun like oh so I get to come up with my own meaning but maybe then in the long run back in the back of our minds were like but there means there's really no meaning. So what's funny is my immediate answer Chris was no because no one actually does that. No one actually lives that way. No one. Maybe sociopaths. OK. Maybe maybe there are people who are genetically wired somehow in a such a broken way or were nurtured in such a broken way. Yeah. That they don't assign any meaning to those things. Right. And but but everyone else does. Yeah. Everyone else does. And it's a it's deeper than just a you know I'm my my my religious belief encourages this or whatever people who were raised in nightmare situations. They still assign meaning to those things. And so either there is meaning to those things abstractly objectively transcendently or there isn't. And you don't get to have it both ways. And often in humanism I feel like this is they want their cake and eat it too. No no this is this is true because of my big brain. My love is different than the love of an antelope. And and that's when I ask like is it so it's just quantitatively different. It's not qualitatively different. We're just more complex and therefore able to have a stronger sense of delusion about we assign more meaning when there is none than an antelope does or then an amoeba does. And I don't know what a meaning is antelopes and amoeba is assigned to to those things or if they do. But you're saying I assign that's but that's what I can't accept that my friendship what I call friendship is nothing more than pack mentality. Now I believe we are pack animals and again even as a evolutionist I have no problem with some of that being passed down. I just don't think that's all that it is. It's not merely a pack preference. I don't I'm not your friend merely because I don't want to get killed by a bear in the night. I'm just hoping and I don't think there's even any rational defense of it. I just don't. You would be a good choice but a lot of my friends would not be a good choice to protect me from assault right. I mean it's like they're not going to help. They're more likely to get me in trouble than I am to get help from them. And so I have I have if the purpose of marriage or marriage has that for a delusional concept the purpose of intercourse is nothing more than procreation. And we don't even start down the path of which I have this conversation. Also is that is that there there are especially on the female body there are organs that seem at this stage we found no evolutionary advantage to them. But they create they create sexual pleasure. But females don't have to experience sexual pleasure in order to procreate. And and so I actually see that as bordering on an evidence of a good creator as well. Whole other conversation but I feel like that's one is that there is and I think there is more to our emotions than merely biochem they are biochemical reactions. I do not think they are merely biochemical. And I don't know how someone could convince me otherwise. That's what I don't know. Yeah. Because you would have to convince me of that you would have to convince me what I call happy is nothing more than safe. Now it is about safe. But it's nothing more than safe. That what I call joy is nothing more than that. And much less love kindness forgiveness friendship. Those are all delusional words assigned to a biological fatalism. And and that's what I I don't know what it would cause me to believe that I can't imagine it. But I think a lot of rarely you'll hear you know atheists be honest about that because a lot of them don't want to go that far. And I think I had read this quote before but Bill Provene William Provene said this let me summarize my views on what modern evolutionary biology tells us loud and clear. There are no gods no purposes no goal directed forces of any kind. There is no life after death. When I die I'm absolutely certain that I'm going to be dead. That's the end for me. And then he says there is no ultimate foundation for ethics. No ultimate meaning of to life. And no free will for humans either. And he's I mean well known a well respected as a as an atheist or as a professor and stuff. But I think that people don't like the hopelessness that that leaves you with. Right. But that's what you're left with that George Gaylord Simpson said man is a result of a purposeless and natural process that did not have him have him in mind. Ernest Nagel said human destiny is an episode between two oblivians. Atheist John Baker said events in the universe may be based upon chance and physical laws that have always existed in human existence has no other meaning than that we exist. Well and it just it leaves you if you're honest it leaves you very hopeless and a very bleak outlook. And yet I think you're exactly right that there's something in us that wants to fight against that the wants to say no there is meaning there is purpose there is hope. But yeah that's just wild and it is a. I was looking at the the the others the atheist Bible. And I did I did not own a copy of it somewhere and I haven't spent a lot of time digging through it but who wrote it. I don't. I'll top my head. I probably have a copy over there on the bookshelf to dig for it but it is. The good book is over there the humanist Bible. I don't know if the atheist bowels over there. But but is that the meaning of life is one of their chapters and in it they acknowledge that they just say since there is no given purpose to life. You have to come up with a purpose for life and and so that's a what a fascinating like to create the light bulb like Thomas Edison as an example. What struck me is as and I haven't looked at this much in detail and maybe I'm giving somebody credit I shouldn't but. The chapter six of the meaning of life in this section. It quotes. I'm not kidding it quotes Douglas Adams and Isaac Asimov in their fiction literature. Like it's quoting I have to go back and look at this but it's. It's the you know the robot Marvin from Douglas Adams like gives this answer and they're using it as a. As a citation of what it's like to be to have to create your own purpose and stuff and so I mean Douglas Adams was allegedly an atheist I get that although he had some really fascinating things to say about life and stuff but. It doesn't. It I am in the here's one of the quotes I'm an atheist that doesn't mean I have nothing to live for it means I have nothing to die for. And even that is clever that's trying to be is Dr. King said until someone has some reason something you're willing to die for they don't have a reason to live. Which is kind of it's a take on Dr. King it's a twisting of Dr. King's words but that is the so my willingness that that's a great example I have something to die for several things to die for. I mean I have a lot of friends I would die for have a whole church full of people I would die for I have family I would die for and certainly the cause of Christ I would die for like these are. And as we're looking at right now you know like what in the last day or two when Canada passed a new law about. You know the conversation about same sex attraction or transgender stuff and and to teach or talk or counsel a certain way can get you put in prison. In me it was an immediate me to my wife sees it on the news and is like what if that comes here what are you going to do like I will I will teach the scripture as it is written as the best I understand it. And I mean she's already what what what we do if you're throw it in prison like I think we've got some time I don't think that's. I don't think I'm going to get arrested in Texas anytime soon for teaching the scripture teaching the Bible much less I mean a lot of things need to change in America right and then. And Texas too because if those things change in America you know probably would be living in the Republic of Texas but. I just this is one of the things that I consider one of the great questions is. And by the way if you don't believe in any of these real meanings if you do believe in like that guy was talking about the fatalism and this is an aspect of atheism that people don't go into much. Is the is the consequence and the serious atheists do the Sam Harris is the Dr Krauss is the even you know the people you're quoting there like they acknowledge this means fatalism this means we don't choose things we think we choose things but choosing something is an illusion. We are no different than any other system we're just a biological system and and we because we've accidentally evolved these big brains. We assign meaning where there is none and so therefore we think we're choosing things and they they point to evidence like. Our brain seems to make a decision before our mind does which again I'm like you have a lot to explain there but but the but that is or. Why would we be any different than any other universe system like whether it's planets or or or whatever we think we have meaning but the truth is we're just doing what our cosmic star stuff. I'm to quote cross again is just doing me we're just following the laws of nature like everything else in nature does we think we're choosing something but we're not we're just following the laws of nature yeah and that's. We're talking about that before we started recording that that idea of determinism then also applies to the skeptic like the reason you're an atheist is because. It's just in your genes you're genetically predisposed or wired to believe in atheism and so why are you even arguing with you right you actually think that you you would disagree with that i'm sure they would say no I really think there's good reasons that i'm in I became an atheist but it'd be like well. But you but according to your world view right what you're telling me you just you can help it right and you have no choice to accept that yeah that's the when we talk about fatalism there's biological fatalism and there's the kind of. You know naturalist fatalism with that's the universal we're all just parts of the universe doing what we do the biological fatalism meaning. Whether it's genetic rains or as a day card to talk about the bound up in genetic rains I think that's the card. But the. Or is it you know is it what I have evolved or what I what I have to do or what what my the keeps me alive. There's nurturing fatalism which is will you believe and do what you were raised to believe and do that connects to kind of the behaviorism we talked about. Be of Skinner's fate behaviorism. Even the problem with that would be our atheist friend David Smalley is a perfect example of no you didn't turn out the way you were like you're right. Michael shermer who started skeptic magazine got had a Christian background right so even that they're they're proved they're disproving their whole idea that you're just a Christian because you're a Christian right and it's like well. You're you're a perfect example of no that doesn't not necessary to be that way yeah and it's not an elitist you don't get to be elitist and say these rules apply to humanity but not me right I am choosing by my free will because I'm I'm one of the specials. Everybody else is just doing what they've been wired to do and I think it's fascinating to even consider. The determinism thing every single law that we have presupposes free will. Right like you had a choice you mean like legal laws like legal legal system yeah sorry every every law assumes you had a choice when you're right and wrong and you chose wrong right but. You know I'm saying like in court you wouldn't argue he had no choice like he murdered because he was wired that way like that just wouldn't hold up anywhere but that's what you're left with. According to Bill Provene there's no free you really have no free will you're right. The I don't know if you've seen in his debate Sam Harris talks about because he's his is a big his is the morality he loves to discuss morality and there's atheism. And and it's funny because he says like you know Islam he thinks of Islam is a blight on humanity like it's it's terrible and he religion as a whole. But he really hates Islam and and so he will talk about how it needs to be essentially outlawed Islamic thinking needs to be outlawed. And people are saying wait but you're also a fatalist so you think someone who's Muslim doesn't choose to be Muslim they are they are determined in advance to be Muslim and even a Muslim terrorist is determined in advance to be Muslim terrorist and he said. That is exactly right and we still have to incarcerate them to protect society. Wow he's like the near you are right they don't have a choice in the matter and yet they must be incarcerated in order to protect society from them. And I'm like OK so who chooses like that is an immediate boy out who gets to decide like what if the determination is that atheism is a blight on society and so now we're going to listen I know Sam you didn't choose to be an atheist you had no choice in this. But we think it is dangerous it's like a small talking about saying. The guys like OK you're your demon ideas we've got to get you know let's finish this once for all is get you out of this system and so either we're going to answer your questions or like. Imagine if you start a conversation with I know you're not choosing to believe I know you have no say in this you are just wired to believe whatever it is you happen to believe and now we're going to change it but you can't change it. What you what do you mean you're going to change it right you're telling me and if I do change it and I guess I was wired to change it how do you how do you argue. If it feels so backwards so going back to intuition how do you do you distinguish between conscience and intuition I do how do you distinguish that well intuition is is just it's a gut level knowledge conscience not consciousness but conscience would be a heading under intuition. And so and all of it intuition is open. To change just like any other source of knowledge is open to change. And so you know someone like when you're you know a great example is as you grow and understand morality when you you go through those different stages of. You don't even think about it you lie because otherwise you might have stopped playing and then at some point you go you go OK lying bad. It's the it's that we call our house the gosh police when you teach your kids the first time like OK don't use the word gosh you know what you're. You're sick so you're for gosh sounds weird coming out of your mouth to use the word gosh and then they will become the gosh please you better never say gosh in public my kids have corrected other people I'm like no no no no. Yes. You just have been like oh oh OK no yeah we don't say stupid or shut up right and and those become the S word yeah and so without being trained our kids will say he said the S word and you have like no oh gosh like that's not that's not the S word but. And so you get to this black and white morality and most people go through that and and then you begin to have to unpack that at a different level of realizing OK. Actually there would be times it would be morally appropriate and even almost morally obligated to lie and and so to realize we have to we grow in that and yet so how does we're not. Conscience I would say the conscience is that's the conscience growing is the conscience goes from I I don't have a conscience about this to I have a gut instinct to respond to this this is bad. To OK now I can experience the feel of my conscience and yet I have a decision to make this bigger than merely my conscience so I do think there is a genetic aspect of conscience but I think it's conscience is also largely trained. And so you can you can have the same emotion if you grow up. I'm believing that you're supposed to make your bed. Then you will have a paying of conscience at leaving your house without your bed made you know it's not necessarily that you think that's a moral right or wrong it's that you have a paying of conscience about that. And that can be true in religious experiences like how much of a paying of conscience do you have if you don't bow your head and close your eyes during a prayer. That's not commanded in the Bible it's just it's just a this something we do when we pray or take your hat off for you. And so how much paying of conscience do you have and that's actually sometimes a challenge in a church generationally is. You know someone wears a hat in the church and some people in the room are saying their conscience should be triggered wearing that hat in here right and yet it isn't because they weren't raised under that same set of rules or you're you're wearing. We've had people leave the church because we eat in our great room where the where the services are had and people get up there like I just I just can't do it I cannot eat in there and it bugs me that other people are eating in there. I mean obviously because where the Bible says not to it's not there. Okay so Romans two. What what what part of intuition or conscience would you say when he says. People without the law do by nature okay the things because their conscience what how would you. So that concept of conscience I believe is the is the work of the Holy Spirit in somebody that the the innate knowledge that there's such a thing is right and wrong. And here's the problem so here's what's difficult about even morality and ethics is. It can be wrong to do what you believe is wrong. Even if you're wrong about what you believe is wrong okay that makes sense so you go okay I should. Feed this homeless person. And and I I'm. I'm not going to feed this homeless person now it may not be morally wrong to not feed that particular homeless person but if you don't feed them when you believe you should feed them. That may be the wrong thing for you to do you still need to feed them because you are convinced us that that's what you need to do. Now you may not need to do it and the truth is there may be an abstract sense in which you do not need to do that. And yet. Your sense is I need to do that then that's I think that's what's being talked about there is that that that's we would that's what we would call. What is called a philosophical terms the warrant and in particular Christian philosophy the warrant of the Holy Spirit is so is when you say I believe the spirit I believe God is telling me this. And if I really believe that I I need to act on that right I could be wrong but if I really believe that that I need to act on that and I think that's what's being talked about is. That when a you know when it when a. Let's say a native American an Incan looked up in the sky and saw the stars and said someone should be worshipped for this well they. That's that is a the conch that is this that is the conscience of the God puts in them the eternity in the hearts of man. That motivates them to do that and they ought to give praise and thanks to whoever is out there for this or even the idea that again that everyone seems to agree with that. Taking innocent life is. You know I'm saying like like for the most part everyone's like oh yeah that's pretty clear yes so where would that where would that come from that's again a great example to watch. The United States deal with the question of abortion when you say so you're okay taking an innocent life and they will say well I don't believe it's alive. Or I don't believe it's a person and that's the new argument because the person is undefinable or difficult to find but they'll say yes it would be wrong to take the life of an innocent person. Okay so you're opposed to abortion no because I don't think they're a person they don't say what difference does it make I mean there's no such thing as right and wrong doesn't matter they still feel the need to defend their reasoning. And Lewis unpacks that so brilliantly and in in mere Christianity we talked about getting pushed or tripped in the subway or whatever. Is like you don't when someone gets up like hey you trip me you don't go and right you go I am so sorry I didn't see like you give a reason you give it a reason for why you trip them yeah and you don't just go. Stinks to be you right right yeah anyway. So go man that's good. Couple other questions I've got for you do you think. That this fatalism argument. That they that might be said like well you just you really believe that because you were raised to believe that right you believe that because you were raised in the United States you believe that whatever right. Is that a would you file that under like ad hominem like is an attack against the person or is it a genetic fallacy like the source or how do you how do you engage with that. Question yeah. The reason I would say partly and ad hominem. Which means to the man attacking the person right as a logical fallacy is it could very well be. That I was raised that way right it has nothing to do with whether or not what I was raised to believe is true. In other words I could believe that the earth goes around the sun only because my dad told me. That doesn't mean that the earth doesn't go around the sun. It just means. My reasoning for it so it isn't I guess my point is it doesn't automatically prove that you're wrong right tells me something about you so if your dad was a. A dentist. In in you told me and you told me flossing is a good idea and I was like well you only believe that because your dad was a dentist. Maybe but the question is is flossing a good idea or if I'm a Lakers fan because I lived in Los Angeles. And here's another example if I were to say. This is pretend you're from Chicago and you like Michael Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players ever and I would say you only believe that because you're from Chicago. What maybe you were raised as a Bulls Bulls fan but that still has nothing to do with whether or not Michael Jordan. Right is a really good basketball player that's a separate issue or you only think seat belts are good idea because you're in an accident like whatever it is it's like. That has nothing to do with the truth it tells something about you but not about whether or not your belief is true. Yeah. Because I there's stories I know of people who don't believe actually the dinosaurs ever existed. Because of how they're raised right and so my the thing would be OK well that's an interesting fact about you right doesn't tell us about whether or not dinosaurs really existed so right I just think that it gets off on. Personal factors about you right that that could be part of the reason but that doesn't still deal with truth right like your motivation for believing something versus is that belief true. Could be could be different and I mean in other words that would tell me something about you but it doesn't tell me whether or not your belief is true. Right so maybe you are a Hindu because you were raised in India that doesn't tell me whether or not Hinduism is true or false that's right just a fact about you. And it could be that you're only a Christian because you're raising America born in America in a Christian home that has nothing to do with whether or not Christianity is true. So absolutely. There's I don't know if that's where you're going but no I think that's cool and so so when you say it I think it is vital that we do understand that when someone makes that they aren't they aren't making a point about the argument. Right no matter how much it feels like they're making a point about the argument if someone says well the only reason you believe is because you know you're raised this or you this. That that may or may not be true it is irrelevant to the argument it has absolutely nothing to do with it and that's and it's okay to point that out it's okay in a conversation to say. You you may be right that may be why I believe that has nothing to do with whether or not the case I'm making is sound. And that's that's important and the genetic fallacy of well the sort the source is where it comes from. You know well you know this this guy has. This guy has written other things that aren't right so this thing must not be right. Or or worse like well yeah that's like when we talk about the. The witnesses of the women and saying that you in that day and age a woman saying it would someone might say well well I mean it's a woman saying it right. Go okay that doesn't mean you get to ignore it it's it's either right or it's not and you don't get to ignore evidence just because it came from a person a certain person. That's when we talked about a few years ago when the the first push the first time I experienced somebody pushing. That as a white man I shouldn't be teaching from the Bible because the Bible was written by and for oppressed people and I'm I'm part of an oppressor people not a part of an oppressed people so I cannot understand. The Bible correctly. And I was like well I mean that that would be by the definition of a genetic fallacy if I teach it as a white man that undermines what I'm teaching well not if it's right yeah and so the question is whether what I'm teaching is accurate or right that's what matters. That happened to me when I was doing a debate. On abortion. I was this is in Southern California this. You know this college on this college campus and big auditorium is really fun but a guy during the debate pointed that out that. Because it was me debating against. Another man from Planned Parenthood and his comment was I just realized I'm going here tonight to hear two men debate abortion. And it's a women's issue was his was his point there you go. And my argument my response rather was that arguments don't have gender. There's a right so a woman could use exactly the same arguments that I'm using and if we're talking about an issue that's a human issue. It's not a gender issue so our human lives being taken are and even our women I'm defending women's rights here if women are being killed as well right. But it's like me saying. You can't say the Holocaust is wrong is not Jewish you go. That is nothing to do with right right or you can speak out against slavery or racism because you're not you're not black it'd be right now that is nothing to do with it. Because again arguments don't have. Right gender or ethnicity or whatever. And even with that line of thinking I told him you would have to throw out row versus Wade. Because I was decided by nine men right. And no one wants to throw it for his way right they want to hold to it so. Five. What was it five men. I thought it was nine isn't that nine. No no I mean in court but it wasn't a five to four. Oh oh I don't know I don't remember if it was five to four six to three. Yeah I don't know but yeah. Anyway this this whole question of intuition was. The conversation initiating for me what would cause you to not believe. And and then running into the the kind of infamous. Nietzschean quote of. You know the big dark secret behind it all is that there is no big dark secret behind it all and. And realizing I'm I don't know what whatever motivate me to accept that because. I don't I don't buy it I don't think. And I think there's too much evidence against it either we are so irrational. What would possibly motivate and I even think of the the conversation like we said with me the two the two of us meeting with Smalley in here the day what the day before Christmas or the day before Christmas Eve or something like that whatever it was the twenty third. You know it was two days after Christmas after Christmas 27 that's right. And and going OK what what is motivating it would have been a fun question but we again we wanted to listen more anything else to ask. Why are the three of us here. I mean what is motivating us to be here what meaning do we assign to this and where does that meaning come from I know my answer I have a pretty good guess at your answer. But but I really do think there's meaning in this there's meaning in me spending the time and spending the time to invest in other people some of whom we've never seen will never meet. But why would I want to invest that in someone who doesn't even agree with me right. I don't see how that offers me any advantage and yet certainly even more so perspective from his perspective but. And I do something to it with a lot of people and again I don't know a whole lot of people who are deconstructing their faith. I think a lot of if a lot of the reasoning is. More moral reasons like God with what you Christians are saying about homosexuality or people who suffer all those things are actually evidence that you care like that there should be some kind of an explanation and there's not that there is there is purpose or is hope there is meaning and you do want justice and all those things that you're feeling right are actually showing. That you all of this stuff really does matter I don't I mean I don't know what percentage of them are just you know right mystic about all of life and it's all meaningless but I think they wanted to have meaning. A lot of times I think it's they just don't like what what God does or they just don't have it I don't know you know I'm saying yes I do absolutely. I even makes me wonder like what point are people going to be able to to step back into I'm willing to accept all of this even if I'm uncomfortable with this belief or even if I disagree with this belief. That that I don't have to deconstruct everything in order to feel uncertain or. Discouraged or even even angry about certain things and and again that's part of what we're here to talk about is is that's a good it is OK for us to have those conversations in humility and then. And then be willing to engage with at some point if I'm in disagreement with God then I'm going to have to accept me being the one who's wrong. And so we will have to spend luckily we're not in a hurry but we will need to spend at some point probably I don't know you think it probably in the later spring after I get back from sabbatical and stuff to really unpack why I have confidence in the holy Bible as revelation from God. So it had a yeah yeah and I think that will it was interesting doctor. Innocent this Sunday referencing you know the four kind of earthquakes and I think he started actually and I haven't talked to them about it and I will I think his earthquake number one is like earthquake number six like what he calls number one I'm like yeah that's like the sixth in line I think which was a. Moving away from scripture as authoritative and and so and he even reference that he goes I could listen I could go into the roots of this all the way back to Nietzsche and content and all these other philosophers and and but. Yeah I think I think something significant happened in the church when so many aspects so many wings of the church began to say missed a lot of wisdom here some great it's a great guidebook but it's not authoritative and. That was a step of deconstruction that was have you ever read the great evangelical disaster by Francis shaver I have not the whole book. The whole book that he talks about is the church departing from God's truth. Is a huge he calls it a watershed moment and he is a really great example cuz he's living over in Europe right of a legitimate watershed where the rain comes down on a mountain and he named it I don't even know all this exactly but he said. On if it lands on the mountain and it goes to the this side of the mountain then it flows down into this thing in this river and it ends up in this ocean yeah but when the rain goes on this side of the mountain you know goes into this river and goes north and heads into this. Yeah that's what a watershed any talks about how it's just you know a thousand miles apart yeah but it landed on the same mountain but that dividing line right there and that's what he goes on to talk about is. At that point of demarcation where if you go with the Bible is an opinion right people's thoughts about God versus God's revelation to us you're going to end up miles apart in so many ways so it's a really good book it's called the great evangelical disaster cool sounds like a winner yeah alrighty I think that'll do for for now and we will we'll pick up with you guys next time.
