We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherritt, Chris Legge, and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hello and welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner and while several of us are out of the office during the holidays, we are sharing valuable episodes that we hope will encourage you and remind you of truth. In the meantime, we are busy putting together our new series that centers on politics as it relates to faith and foundations, as well as digging into tough topics under the umbrella of politics that have led people to question their faith and deconstruct. We hope you enjoy the episode and we can't wait to jump into our new series soon. Welcome to Reconstructed Faith. This is episode two and after our first episode, just kind of doing a general introduction, introduction to our hosts, Chris and Chris, and then also an introduction into why we're doing the podcast. We think it would be really smart. Really smart. We think it would be a good idea though to step into kind of a definition series because we're talking about a lot of words that can be misdefined or defined from individual to individual. It would be good for us to kind of set a foundation, to lay a foundation for where we come from as we're unpacking this. So yeah, Chris, do you, Chris, share it. Do you want to talk about what we're going to be talking about during this episode? Sure. Well, the big issue that to clarify for most people is when we say Christianity is true, what we mean by that is not subjectively true, personally true, although there is always a subjective part of your faith. But what we mean is whether or not I believe it is actually true. Like it's objectively true outside of me. And what I would say is it's the best explanation for the way things are the origin of the universe or design or life or meaning or morals, whatever. But again, and this is why truth and faith go together, that we're not saying Christianity is true because I believe it's true. In other words, my, my, the amount of faith I have or my personal convictions or whatever have nothing to do with whether or not it's true. And the thing about Christianity is it's, it's an evidential faith. It's verifiable, but it also means it can be disproven. Like what we're saying is there's a real risk there that we actually could be wrong because my personal feelings don't, don't make it right or wrong or true or false. And so I think defining what we mean by Christianity is true. What do we mean by that would be a good definition. Yeah, that's great. Before we jump over to you, Chris, my question is, have we always dealt with a lot of this, well, truth is actually subjective, or is this like a recent phenomenon? And why is, why is like the whole idea of, well, my truth now such a popular thing? What is that like a generational thing? That'd be a great, we ought to get Mark Legge, a philosopher student in here at the time to talk about the history of epistemology. So before you think we've now gone over into a medical world about, you know, urinary tract stuff, epistemology is actually the kind of the art and science of knowing what is right or knowing what is true, or even knowing what is knowable. Right. And so it's an important concept when we're talking about this, what, what is knowable? And so the question, what is knowable has been around for a very, very, very, very long time. It's essentially some people would say the first philosophical study was epistemology. What can we know? What do we not know? That's one. So yes, the conversation has been going on forever, but most of history, as I understand it, again, a good philosophy student might correct me on this, is that the generalized understanding was that there was such a thing as abstract, objective, disinterested, external truth. That you can know. That you can know. There are things out there that you can know. And you can also be wrong about them. Like there's such a thing as wrong. And so whether it's basic, like mathematical truth, statements of mathematical truth, so any given statement. So when Chris is saying Christianity is true, he's kind of saying Christianity makes a series of claims. And each of those claims is a statement of truth. And truth just means accurate. It doesn't mean anything more than this is really what it is. This is accurate. Corresponds to reality. There you go. Corresponds to reality. This is what is, this is as it is. And so, and you can be wrong about it. And that's a, that's a big, big conversation is to, it's to make a truth claim, as Chris just said, is to also make the claim that it could be, what I'm claiming could be proven wrong. It could end up being not true. And which is fascinating that very often in scientific circles today, Christianity gets criticized for making claims that can't be verified. And that's just, it's just not accurate. There are certain claims Christianity makes that can't be verified in a lab or in a test tube. But that doesn't mean that they can't be verified or disproven. And we'll get to those, I'm sure, as we get, when we get to Christianity, which, you know, given, given the three of us at the table, maybe eight weeks later, but, but this idea, so to jump into the conversation, does that, does that sound right? Does that answer the question? Yeah, I think it does. I mean, people have been, is it, gosh, see, this is when I need the professional handy. Is it Descartes who had the, I think therefore I am. And that's the, that's one of, that's a question of epistemology. What can I know? Who am I? Do I exist? And how would I know if I exist? How would I know if I don't exist? I mean, those are the fundamental philosophical questions. And his answer, at least what he gained comfort in was I'm asking the question, therefore I must be here. Right. If I wasn't, if I wasn't here and there wasn't such a thing as truth, I wouldn't be asking the question in the first place. And that's, which is kind of cool. Good way of thinking. Once you unpack for a second. So you mentioned epistemology, it deals essentially with how do you know things. And so the different categories would be. Okay. Let me go through those. Yeah. So I don't, I never know what order to do them. I'll do them in common order of modern popularity. So the first one is empirical evidence. Empirical evidence is that something is knowable because we can repeat it. We can show that the same thing happens every time we do something or every time we ask a certain question, we get the same answer every time. It's often people shorthand that as quote, science. It's very, I will tell you, I think for most students of truth, no matter what field they're in, the fact that science is just a term is, it's kind of embarrassing. I think most serious scientists are embarrassed by the idea of well, science says science is not a causational power. It's science says nothing. It doesn't say anything. It doesn't do anything. It's a theoretical way of learning information. The word just means knowledge. That's right. It's a, it's such a great, for Christians, it is so sad and frustrating how Christians have a, I developed at some point a knee jerk response to the idea of science or scientific knowledge as a negative. Like, oh, well, science is this, but Christianity says this. And, and I think that's just a, there's a silly, I don't know what you're, you've taught on this. Like historically the scientists throughout many eras of Christianity were Christians. Exactly. Well, I think that we partly created the dichotomy ourselves where we made it sound like you've got a pick between the two. And I think it's because we became intimidated by, I don't know, maybe over the last hundred years, what scientists were saying their interpretation of the facts, but we began to be like, again, taught like, well, that's the enemy of your faith or it goes against your faith. And I would just say it's, it's a way of knowing science is awesome, but it's just one way of knowing you can't. So another way of knowing could be intuition. Like you just know, you know, torturing children for fun is wrong. Right. Like you just know that. And we haven't ever gone in the lab and said, let's, you know, prove this with the scientific method. But anyone who would disagree, you're like, something's wrong with you. If you don't see that, and we would use that word, see it, like, can you not just see it? And so that's another way of knowing. And that's, that's a real one. It gets poo pooed in some circles sometimes, but Sam Harris, who is, who is always an atheist, who's always in a search for an objective standard of morality that doesn't evolve. God has written some brilliant stuff and he's come as close as I think it's possible to come. Well, I think it still fails, but I think he's come as close as he can come. And there was a great interview with him when someone asked him like, okay, but Sam, when you say, what is the greatest good for the greatest number of people? Who decides that? Like who decides that this is wrong? So if you say, well, but I, I think most people like torturing people. I think that most people like that. How do you know that you're not the one who's wrong about that? Like how do you, and Sam goes, you just know, like, I should, if I have to explain that to you, there's something wrong. Like, right? Because intuition is a source of knowledge. As Christians, of course, we would say that intuition can be an aspect of general revelation that God has revealed things through that. I've said with regards to intuition, when an atheist says, what, what would cause you to disbelieve? And I will tell them, here's what I suspect the pattern would be. We'll get to this and we get to faith. But, and that the last one would be my intuition, because my intuition tells me this all matters. Like I'm unwilling to accept the consequences, the intuitive natural, the consequences of us just being complicated amoebas is not something I'm willing to accept because then my love for my wife is just reproductive drive. My love for my children is just DNA preference. My love for my friends is just herd mentality. And I don't buy it. I don't, I don't know how you could possibly sell me that this stuff doesn't matter. What we're doing right now is just us enacting an overly evolved brain capacity that we don't know what to do with. So we invent podcasts to, to pretend like it has meaning. And I just not willing, I mean, that would be a hard one to push over. You could push over all the others. That would be a tough one. That's very real. Anyway, so we did spherical Evans and intuition. Okay. Let's jump to history. History is a source of knowledge and that is what has been passed down as, as accurate and real. This is what happened. There was a guy named George Washington, right? There was a person named Augustus Caesar. Like these are, those happened. There really was a battle of Bunker Hill. And we would say I, in that category is eyewitness testimony. Like that's how you know is because well, people were there, people saw it. That's how we know. Right. I wrote about it. Yeah. The evidence is they saw it. Like they acted though they saw it. The things they did next in their life would indicate they really did experience that. Yeah. And so that falls, that passes down historical knowledge. I think it falls under authority knowledge, actually, where historical is now that I'm thinking about it. I think it's authority slash historical. Okay. And here's the thing. We trust if so a lot of people also be very dubious about that one, which I can, I mean, spoiler alert, we're going to get to the end and discover humans aren't great at any of these. Okay. So just, we are the fly in the ointment. We're the monkey in the wrench. I don't think that's correct, but whatever it is. So that's going to be, that's us. We're going to mess each of these up. Something happened. Eyewitness testimony. Isn't awesome. YouTube, all kinds of fun experiments to see how that's proven. However, think of how often we rely on this as a source of truth and knowledge. So when I get home, my wife saying, Oh, we had a tough day today is, is either accept that or I don't as knowledge. That is either statement of fact and truth, or it isn't, even if it's just her giving me her perspective on truth, which we'll talk about that in a minute, because an accurate statement, either she did or she didn't, in this case, probably only she knows. But that's a, that is a statement of authority or history is this what happened. And so it's, it's really wild. This one, this one, people throw away very quickly when the truth is we rely on this for every thing as a source of knowledge. Okay. So that's, so that falls under authority or history or historical knowledge. And then off of that would be what your wife just said. Eyewitness I'm sorry, personal experience. Like, how do you know that you had a bed? Well, cause I'm the one who experienced it. Or how do you know it yet for breakfast? Well, I'm the one who experienced it. So I, I just know. So that's the fourth one. Or is that falls under still under authority in history, that personal, I experienced it or intuition or whatever, but then the next two reason that we can rationalize things, we can think through things that, okay, well that has to be that way. Cause that's the only way that that makes sense. And that's like Descartes saying, I think therefore I am. Well, that doesn't make any sense that I'm not here. If I am experiencing being here, that's illogical. Right. Reason actually has more and more anciently tested rules than empirical evidence does. So we, we teach empirical evidence very often in the schools as though it's the most trustworthy because it has the best rules. But the truth is there are fan, I mean, the reason actually is more rules engaged with it when you hear logical fallacies or things like that. And, and not to, again, not to sell anything else, but on YouTube, there is a Star Trek cartoon explanation of all the major logical fallacies where Spock explains to a different Star Trek crew member, the logical fallacy they've made. And they're just pure gold. They're like two, two minutes each. And yet an intensely deep, difficult concept is unpacked beautifully just in a few seconds like that. So that's pretty, it's worth. Well, that's good. We'll put that in the show notes. There you go. That sounds good. I'm going to add another book. I mean, if you want to read a book on the two JP Morland YouTube video, sorry, JP Morland's book, loving God with all your mind. Yes. Actually teaches you how to think logically, like this is what a syllogism like it's like this, this, therefore this. Um, that's a great book. So where would like when you're, um, when you're looking at prophecy, okay. We got one more. Okay. So, okay. Nevermind. Yep. Number five is good revelation revelation. Yeah. And unpack that one. Are you going to be good? Uh, you can keep going. I'm doing a good job. So revelation is, is statement of truth, accurate statements that we get from God. Um, now again, like with all of them, the flaw is not in the statement. It's not in the theory. It's in the receiver. So we are flawed receivers of God's input. If we were perfect receivers of God's input, then revelation would honestly, obviously be the best source, which is why Christians, for example, especially evangelical Christians spent a lot of time studying and digging through. And honestly, let's be honest, tearing at and tearing apart scripture. Um, it always, it always cracks me up when people will say like that we're not, you know, that we're, we're not, we're too trustworthy of it or we're not sophisticated enough or, Oh my gosh, there, there's probably not many verses in the Bible that have not had doctoral thesis written about that verse and every single piece of it. It's, there's so much great material out there that it states shows exactly the opposite. We are the most, maybe more than any other, gosh, any one of any time I would pit Christians as, uh, not, not each individual Christian, of course, but into Christianity as a whole, as being, uh, digging so deeply into what we consider to be God's word. Um, it, we're doing it right now at this church where we're, we're going to teach first Peter in a year. I mean, it takes 13 minutes to read first Peter and yet we're going to spend, you know, 50 sermons, 50, 40 minute sermons on it. That's clearly, we're not afraid of it. We're digging into it and asking questions. And that's not, that's not uncommon in Christian churches to do that kind of thing. So revelation material that we get directly from God. Okay. Great. So just unpacking these are, what would you call these? Like five, five sources of knowledge, five sources of knowledge. And this is all under epistemology. These are the most five commonly taught. There's a few outliers, but these are the ones generally that are taught. Empirical evidence, intuition, authority, historical knowledge, reason, and revelation. Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you for unpacking that. Yeah. And reason, reason is the one that gets, uh, ignored a lot now. And that's assigned the modern scientific community is actually really honestly just kind of throwing under the bus. Why? Um, because it's not scientific. Oh, just in its nature, like how you prove it. The irony is the, the Dr. Tyson's of the world who talk about empirical evidence as leading to conclusions. No, no, we know this reason and philosophy. You're always still just asking more questions. You never reach any conclusions. That's his, his critique of it. When the truth is empirical evidence was scientific reasoning was actually created one based on reason. There's no such thing as scientific evidence without reason. Um, the whole concept of science is based on reason because you can't scientifically prove that the scientific method works or that it's the only source of knowledge. And you certainly can't prove it. Yes. It is actually illogical to say it's the only source of knowledge since you can't use it to prove it exists. Yeah. That's one of the rules of logic is, uh, self self refuting statements must be false. So if I say no sentence has five words, well, that's, it has to be false by definition. It falsifies itself. I can't speak a word of English. That's right. Um, there's no such thing as absolute truth. That's a self defeating statement. If it's true, then it's a statement of absolute truth. And therefore it is false. Yeah. Um, that's one of the rules. Well, the statement, the only source of knowledge is empirical evidence is a self refuting statement. Unless you can prove with empirical evidence, that empirical evidence is the only source of knowledge and you can't, therefore it's a self-refuting statement. Yes. So this is a big conversation that people aren't just aren't having very well nowadays. And I think too, going back to even science and empirical evidence, when we say science, we're talking about knowledge. It's an ally for truth. It leads you to truth. Absolutely. Point to that. But the problem is that science as methodology, right? Science as philosophy ends up being arriving at the right kind of answers. That's right. So if you're going into this saying we can only come up with materialistic explanations for this, well, you're not, you're biased. Like you're already, you're saying, I already know, or we can only arrive at. And so now you're, you're dealing with sciences, your philosophy of knowledge versus we're arriving at knowledge, but we've got to have the right. Why is that? Where, when you hear the idea of science versus Christianity in our culture right now, is that typically what you're hearing? Like less about the method and more about the, I mean, not necessarily, not necessarily less about the method, but more philosophy. Yes. Honestly, the main thing you're hearing is ignorance. Okay. When you hear that phrase, either on the part of the, of the secular scientist, or I wish this wasn't true on the part of the Christian. So it is, it is so often the idea is that, that the purpose of science is to undermine Christianity or the purpose of empirical evidence is to, it goes back to what we talked about, I think our first podcast, that reason, that faith and evidence are somehow contradictory. And we'll talk, we'll unpack that more with our next one, but that's just not, that's not the Christian way of thinking about things. It's bad enough that the secular world wants to think that way. We have got to stop buying into that. We don't believe that there's no, there's only truth. And true is true or it's not true. And it's, that's a concept when we say, truth, that's what we mean. A, as Chris said, something that aligns with reality. It is, it is an accurate statement. It can be about something that is personal. It can be, if I say, I like the Beatles better than the monkeys. Well, that's, it's either true or false. I'm the only one that knows. Right. Um, it's not clarify that. Cause what that means is that's a subjective statement, right? Which means it's about you, the subject, right? Not the object. So that's maybe, maybe to just distinguish that. So if I had a jar of M and M's right here and I said, let's, let's guess how many M and M's are in here and you give a number and you give an MRI, give a number. It's that's your subjective opinion about you, the subject. I think it's this, but there is actually an, a correct number of how many M and M's are in the jar. So it's objectively true. If I said, now each of you write down the best flavor of ice cream, and we all wrote that down, that's subjectively true. It's true about you that whatever you were to say. And so the, the problem is a lot of people, when they say, when they think about, um, statements like that, everyone thinks in the world and even a lot of Christians that it's all everything's, you know, ice cream versus M and M's in a jar. Right. And so that's the problem that we're having is that a lot of people are making statements that they're saying, well, personally, I think that, so for example, I saw someone or heard someone on a, on a radio show call in and say, well, I have a personal, they might've said religious conviction that life begins at conception. And I was like, you, you don't have to use those words. You don't have to say it's personal. Just me, my faith. It's like, no, the objective facts are this life begins at conception. So that's where now again, I can have a subjective faith about that, or that can be the way I was raised. It just, it goes along with the evidence. But I think a lot of times Christians think like that, that, that my faith did Jesus rise from the dead. Well, that's just me personally, you know, believing it versus Paul made it a big, in fact, every major sermon in the book of acts mentions the resurrection and the phrase that you hear all through the new Testament, uh, sorry, all through the, the new church there that's growing was we are witnesses, right? Like I'm verifying it as a way of knowing that I can tell you, I saw it myself. So they weren't saying Jesus rose from the dead, just have faith. They were saying like, come talk to me about it. Like, I can tell you I'm appealing to the fact that we saw this. Um, that was even a Pentecost. Peter's argument was we know David where David was buried. He's still in his tomb, right? And we all, and this is right around where all this happened just weeks after it happened. But there's an empty tomb that we can all go look at. It's verifiable again, I guess. That's right. Yeah. That's, it is important to understand that is what Chris said about Christianity is right is that we are, we are one, we're asking, gosh, I would say the apostle Paul in first Corinthians 15 almost begs for it to be disproven. Like he's like, please, Hey, if you can, if you've got the body, bring it like lie, I would love to see it. I'd love to know because if, if Jesus did not rise from the dead, we're, we are to be the, we're the most humiliated people in the world. I mean, if you can even wrap your, gosh, we're getting off on the whole concept of Christianity and belief here, but just a couple of words. If you can imagine being a Jew and your whole religion is based on the idea that the Lord, our God, he is one, that's what makes him so special, makes us special. And he chose us. And then to say, and he is three and Jesus is God. I mean, it would sure be a whole lot of, if, if you're, if we're wrong, if there is no Christianity, if Jesus was not the son of God, Yahweh is probably not pleased with us. I mean, we are the ultimate heretics. If, if there is, and Paul grew up his whole life with this belief system and yet something convinced him, this is not the truth is something more than that. And he's, he's happy to be, listen, I'm just telling you, because Paul didn't, as far as we know, did not see the resurrected Jesus in the flesh. But, but he says, man, there's these 500 people who saw him. And I assume Paul would talk to several of them. So you're, I mean, really, come on, now's the time to tell me the, I mean, Paul may have questioned some of them under torturing. This is the apostle. This is when Saul, Paul was Saul. He may have gotten to hear Christians under torture refuse to back off of their beliefs. And man, that would be, that'd be pretty convincing when someone's not willing to bend on that. So, yeah. Anyway, I think, I think there are verifiable things. I agree. And I understand the frustrating with frustration with some modern skeptics. That's the most potent things that would disprove Christianity are in the past now. It would be hard to show up with Jesus's body, even if the Romans or the Jews or the Christians somehow hit it. It's, I mean, it's probably too late now. And I get that, but it certainly could have been snuffed in its infancy. But that's when we're talking about truth, we're not saying this is, this is my opinion. So this is one of the wild things is that we used to have words that broke down this concept of truth. That if I said, my favorite ice cream is, you know, whatever is butter, brickel, that is a statement of truth. There's an accurate statement there. I am aligning with reality, assuming that I'm not lying, you know, what's your favorite color? Did you know I was going there? Blue, no pink. Monty Python fans out there. As long as I'm telling the truth, it is the truth. But we have a word, we had a word for subjective truth. And we called that opinion or preference or viewpoint. We had a word for that. That wasn't minimizing the concept. It was just giving a definition to the word, a personal subjective statement of truth. I like that dress better than that dress. I like that song or that musician. It is a true statement. It's not a lack of truth, but people, I think the problem is, too often nowadays we're dealing with is that people have expressed their perspectives on something and felt not listened to. So they're now, they're having to come up with stronger language to call it. But that's like they'll say, that's my truth. And it sounds very dismissive to say, I mean, we have a word for that. It's called experience or opinion or perspective or viewpoint. And that sounds dismissive. I don't have a problem with people calling it my truth, as long as they recognize that it's not an objective standard. It's not an absolute truth. And that's what we mean when we say truth, as it's verifiable. It's something that we can defend. And we all, gosh, and even just we deal with the problem of language so badly that we're using language to describe something that is transcendent of any given language. And that creates problems for us too, that I don't want to get off on too far. I don't remember, you might've talked about this when you went through the book of John, but I would love to have known the tone or the expression of Pilate's face when Jesus said, for this reason I was born to testify to the truth, everyone on the side of truth listens to me. And then Pilate goes, what is truth? And I would love to know, was he skeptical? What is truth? I really want to know, or is he cynical? Because it's like the truth is in front of you. But I just have always wondered, what did you mean by that? When you said, well, what is truth? I always pictured as a skeptical, but the rest of Pilate's life certainly indicates he didn't learn anything from that experience. But I think there's a, I've always pictured him as going like, yeah, what is truth? What is truth? It's kind of like the, remember the matrix when he does the, when Morpheus says this is meant to hide you from, to protect you from the truth or to hide you from hide from you? You've never seen the matrix either? No. Oh my gosh, we gotta watch like 20 movies with you. That's going to be a whole new podcast. Evaluating all the movies he's not seen. Oh my gosh. Oh man, that's another podcast for another day. But wait, there are people that will listen to this who know what you're saying. So he says, yeah, what truth? What truth is the response that he gives back. And that's what he says, the truth that you've been lied to, the truth that there's been pulled over your eyes, a lot to be pulled over your eyes. And so, which is ironic statement, lie, the truth that you've been lied to, the truth is you've been lied to. And that's a powerful picture. But I think, I think as unwrapping that, okay, so I want to, the idea of an accurate statement that could be disproven, the idea of something that aligns with reality. When we use the word truth, that's what we mean. So if, if meaning we're inviting disagreement, yeah, we're inviting, okay, if you've got evidence to the contrary, we'd love to hear it. One of the hardest and actually I'm not a super emotional person on stage. One of the hardest, most emotional moments I think I've had in a sermon was turning to my children and saying, you need to believe the truth, whatever it is, even if it's in opposition to something I say, like if it's opposition to what you've been taught your whole life, if you learn that it's not true, don't believe it. We worship a God of truth. And if it's, if something that I've taught you or that you've learned in church isn't true, don't believe it. And that's, I feel always safe saying that we are, we are seeking truth because we, we claim to survey God of truth. Who wouldn't want us to believe a lie? No matter what it is. But we also need to unpack without going into too much detail, the world, the word world view, because that's going to come up. So I'd love, Chris, this is kind of an area of Chris's expertise. I'd love to hear his thoughts on worldview. What do you mean by that? What do we mean? We use that term for people. So my, my basic definition is a person's presuppositions about reality and morality. Like that's my really, that's my canned explanation. So what I mean by that people have called your worldview, your vision of life or your basic assumptions. But I always try to compare it to, it's like we're all wearing glasses. And so you're viewing the world through your worldview. And the thing that happens a lot is people, we're always thinking with our worldview, but not about our worldview very much. And so this, I think plays into the unquestioned answers thing we talked about last time, that if you've grown up in the church or grown up in whatever religion, you just have a basic way of assuming and interpreting an experience. Like we prayed and there's an answer, like something happened. And then what, well, that was God. Interesting story. One time I had a, a thing that I'd been praying about a car when I was in college and a really cool provision. And I was telling that story and the reply by one of the people here in the story was, well, that was lucky. And so again, his, his pre presuppositions about reality were like, well, miracles don't happen. There's not a God who does answer prayer. So that was just luck. Or my, my worldview would interpret it saying, well, that was clearly God answering my prayer. So it's your, your presupposition. So again, pre meaning beforehand that you already bring to the table. And I always like to remember and remind myself the idea of a completely objective scientists coming into the lab with no precept. It's like everybody brings your presuppositions right into it. Again, it's just a matter of, are you aware, aware of it? Are you honest enough to say like, no, I could be wrong or I could be thinking this the wrong way or whatever, but it's your basic way of viewing the world. Yep. What would you, would you, I love the example. I think you're the first one I saw do it. Although I'm sure somebody came, somebody else, probably one of those things you probably saw when it was like battle teach with the glasses, the different color glasses. Did you come up with that or was it a student of mine? I think at Liberty university, he had gone off and had a teacher do that, but I did it last week with a forge and it actually worked. Can you describe it? I would have, I was talking about world view and I put on red tinted glasses and explained like what that means is now everything that I'm seeing is viewed through these. And so everything has a tint to it. I see everything red. And I had a, as the student to put it on and then put a slide up that had words, but some of the words were in yellow. So the rest of the class could see those words up there, but for some reason, red tinted glasses, cancels out yellow on a screen if it's a white background. And so I had words up there like truth or moral absolutes or God, whatever, and he couldn't read it. And so my point was that the way you view the world can also eliminates, you can't see some things or you refuse to see some things or you won't see them because of your, your worldview. In other words, if I go into the lab already assuming I know there's no, I already know there's no God, then that takes away some of the questions I can actually ask. It's like a, you know, a police chief telling all of his crew, like, Hey, we got to solve this crime. But already just, you know, we already know it's no, it's no one on the force. It's none of us in this room. You'd be suspicious. You're like, well, first of all, why are you already assuming that? But what that means is you just eliminated a whole bunch of questions we can ask. And it also means I can't follow the evidence wherever it leads because, because of the rules you've already set up. And so even going back to science, if you're defining science as only the right kind of answers, your worldview, if that's your worldview, that it's got to be empirical evidence is the only way of knowing. Well, that means you can't say, well, it really in all other areas of life, when we see this much intelligence or order or design or complexity, we assume there's a mind behind it or whatever. But I can't, I can't ask that question. So that's where your worldview can actually limit what you can ask. Absolutely. Yeah. Which is, I mean, you can see how that's going to keep you from certain options. It's a, one of the things that I've run into, and I know you'll hear me talk about you guys have, but the, trying to get invitations to free thinkers associations and no one will let me come, which doesn't feel very free thinking to me. Right. I think, I think that's part of the problem is that, is that more and more often those types of things just aren't, they're not reality. There's not a, there's not actually a free thinking going on, but they don't realize that. And I think that's one of the things, one of the, I guess for lack of a term, advantages that, that good engagement with these conversations can have for somebody is it is important that we know our own presuppositions. It was a, that idea of the glasses that Chris did when I was teaching it to a group of, of ladies, I had them do math questions on the board and, but I had them having, wearing different color glasses. And so they kept coming to different answers and they were all getting infuriated. I mean, frustrated with like each other. Like, I don't, I don't understand. Wait, what do you mean this? Okay. I said 15 and you said a thousand and 15. Well, this lady couldn't see plus 1000 as the last step in the puzzle. And she's like, where are you, what are you guys? And I mean, like literally people's moods and temper were starting to flare up and I had them take the glasses off. And it's just because your glasses didn't allow you to see the information that you needed for that step. And it's, it is, it is, that is a, it's part of why I listened to multiple podcasts from different perspectives because it is, it is so hard for me to wrap my brain around the different worldview. And we're, we're super divided as a nation right now down this line. I'm the question of worldview. And we're actually, I'm teaching a seminar in a few weeks actually on the fact that I think that our worldview is shifting in, in America. We've the Judeo-Christian worldview has been the dominant cultural worldview, at least for as long as America has been around. And then what happens when that shifts? It's not just that there, there have been plenty of other worldviews, but the dominant worldview shift. And that's, I'm fascinated to see what that means for a culture. In the past, when that kind of thing happens, it's ugly. I mean, you see revolutions and civil wars and that kind of stuff happen, rebellions. And it's just to see a worldview shift, I don't know if, if the world is at a place yet where worldview can totally shift dominance without some pretty horrific consequences or not. We'll see, but it's, it's this stuff we've been talking about in this little defining section about what we mean when we say the word truth, personal versus repeatable versus reasonable. And you'll notice, if you listen, almost anyone talk about truth, they'll start dividing it up. And whether they know it or not, they are dividing it based on those, usually those five sources of knowledge, and they're minimizing one or two of them and maximizing one or two of them. And they don't know that's what they're doing, because they're not trained in epistemology. And so they're just like, no, this is whether it's, you know, Ken Ham talks about two different types of scientific knowledge. And what he's doing is dividing up epistemology, or Dr. Tyson, who does the same thing dividing into two headings. And he, it's still divided down that same path. And he's just saying, this is the, this is the right one is the dominant one, this is the good one. And, you know, and they get mad when, when everybody else does it, they get frustrated with it, but everybody does it, everybody divide, because it has to be divided out. And it's just old theory. Yeah. But I think even if you're talking to people, defining terms is always helpful. Oh my gosh. Because if I'm saying faith and you're saying faith, and we mean something, you mean blind faith, and I mean intelligent faith, then we're not gonna, we're gonna be missing each other. So sometimes it's helpful to go when I say truth, just so you know, I'm not saying it's true, because I believe it's true. I mean, it's objectively true. So that might, that might help sometimes. Yep. Yeah. And, and I think because, and as we get kind of further along in this definite definition series, and the beginning, these are words that we're going to be using a lot. Yeah. And so, and that's kind of the purpose for the podcast. Yep. So that's great. If I could just add one thing, what I think you'll find since you mentioned worldview is when you hear someone who, for example, if their worldview is they're a humanist or atheist, there's no God. And so we, you know, we're just evolved in things like that when they actually spell out, this is, so this is what this means. It really sounds depressing when they actually follow with your, so listen to this. This is William Provine atheist. I've heard him in debates before, Bill Provine, but here's what he says. And this is, this is a helpful reminder. He says, let me summarize my views on what modern evolutionary biology tells us loud and clear. There are no gods, no purposes, no goal directed forces of any kind. There is no life after death. When I die, I'm absolutely certain that I'm going to be dead. That's the end for me. And then this is the sad part at the end. He says, there is no ultimate foundation for ethics, no ultimate meaning to life and no free will for humans either. Which is always funny when you think of going to the free thinkers, it's like, well, if you listen to some of these people, they're saying you actually don't have a free will. And the only reason you think you're a free thinker is because it was programmed in your DNA. But that's right. But when you hear those descriptions, he's not being a pessimist. He's being honest. Like this is where this worldview will take you. If there's no god, then there's no purpose. There's no ethics. There's no meaning. There's no value. And you're actually not free.
