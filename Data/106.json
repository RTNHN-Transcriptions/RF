We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined as always by my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg. Guys, I'm glad to be back with you talking about, well, right now we don't know what we're going to talk about because Chris walked into the studio and he said, hey, I've got a question for Bryn and I'm going to wait until we're on air. We just press the record button. We are live. We've been recording for together for a while. Early on, I would have been like, um, what? And I do think this plays into a deconstruction, a deconstruction, at least theme. Oh man, he's going to make you deconstruct. That's right. On air. On air right here. That's right. But sorry, okay, Chris, I'm throwing it over to you. Let's get this show on the road. You're ready. Uh, I'm as ready as I can be bear or man. Are you familiar with this question? I think so. If you're, if you're, if you were wandering alone in the woods, would I rather run into a random man or a random bear? That seems like it should be an easy question, but is not in which direction does it seem like it should be easy. Um, I at face value, it seems like man, because it seems like universally people are afraid of bears. However, I think men in some ways are less predictable than bears when it comes to being a female. Um, probably, probably a bear. Okay. You'd rather run into a random bear than a random man. If you were alone in the woods, I would rather, I mean, I have to ask a lot of questions. I think I would rather if Bryn had a random Bryn, well, if, or if Bryn was out to get you who, yeah, if, if it was like, oh, two people, two things are coming to get you, man. There's a bear and Bryn Starnes. I'd be like, is she armed? She has a special set of skills. I think there's, there's Krav Maga, man. I think there are a lot of questions that would change, a lot of questions that I would have that would change it. Obviously, Grizzly, I would rather run into a man than a Grizzly. Right. That was what my, my, my daughter naturally being my daughter, her first question was what kind of bear. Yeah. Yeah. I, thank you, I assumed that I wasn't allowed to ask the first question. Right. Exactly. This is a TikTok or I think other, other social media also thing that's going on right now. And so far the pattern is guys, six out of seven women say bear. Yeah. Now, this is, I'm not surprised, but yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised after teaching the Gavin De Becker material and doing self-defense, but let's, let's unpack this a little bit. What's Gavin De Becker who wrote the book, the gift of fear and in the gift of fear, he says, and actually I think he says killed, I think a better answer would be assaulted, but that, that a woman's number one fear is being assaulted by a man. That, that most women's number one fear is being assaulted by a man. Women, women make dozens and dozens of decisions a day on average to avoid being put in a compromising situation with a male. I've heard you teach on that. And I think some of them are subconscious. So I don't even think most women would identify or some women, I don't think a lot of women would identify their, that as their primary fear, right? Their actions and the way they make decisions would reveal that it is. Yes. So we've talked about how women will, because I would say like, if I was, if I was, had certain things with me, I would much rather run into a man, but you know, just, that was my other thing. Yeah. This is what's fascinating. So as a psychologist, it's fascinating because one, I think that very much so affirms de Becker's theory that women's number one fear is being assaulted by a man. But even just talking a second ago with Kendall, another person on our staff and talking through this and saying, I mean, so, you know, my wife instantly said bear. She was like, I'd rather run into a bear instantaneously, no question asked. And Ellie had a few questions or whatever, but my daughter Ellie did. And a lot of women will have questions, but if you're not allowed to ask questions, apparently six out of seven women so far saying they'd rather run into a bear. Now, which is wild because you, I mean, obviously I think there's a lot of factors here. The lack of awareness with bears. I think probably women who work with bears on a regular basis would be like, Oh, a man for sure. Because they, they, they experience the fear of bears and most humans don't experience actually the actual fear of, you know, something that's twice the size of your average man and way more deadly than your average man and whatever. Because then what it is for the average female is just like more of a fear of the unknown than a fear of unknown, something that they are already afraid of, you know, because they don't have a lot of experience with bears. But what they, what's interesting is most women don't have much experience with predatory men either. That's true. But because of media, we've been, we get communicated with us every time there is a predatory man. Most women have thousands of relationship with men and most women will only have, hopefully a few interactions with predatory men. The statistics don't work because obviously, you know, 100% of bears are predatory and 2% of men are predatory. Maybe let's go, let's go 10%. It's probably more like 2 to 5%, but we'll go 10%. So your odds are still way in favor if you choose a man that he's going to be a man who's actually going to be very helpful. But isn't it interesting that in our culture today, a woman's, the thought of a woman being alone in the woods and running into a man is not relief. It's not comfort. It's not, oh good. Like now I'm safe. It is, I would literally at least at the intuitive level, rather that random man be a bear than be a man. And again, I think if you created the actual scenario and said, in cage one, you're in a cage. In cage one, we have a random bear and in cage two, we have a random man. I'm about to open one cage and let them into your cage. Which one do you actually want? I don't know how many of those, like under a real actual controlled environment, would women actually do that? Or as part of what's going on as women are communicating, there's something broken in our culture that we don't have a sense of safety, relief, whatever, at the thought of a random man. Is that issue an issue of fear? That we are all afraid of our children being kidnapped. We're all afraid of things that almost never happen or rarely enough happen. But the truth is men can be scary and can be predatory. But also there's the truth of like, now I think the stats are one in four women have been sexually abused by the time they're 18. Yes, that's right. One in four, actually one in three or one in four. Yeah, it's either that or even worse. Yeah. And like one, maybe it's one in three for girls and one in four or five for boys. Something like that. Like the boy stats have gotten higher, but I think that's part of it too is like, and I feel like we've talked about this before, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts, but don't you think that predatory behavior has increased in the last couple of decades? Like prime maybe because of the internet or addiction? I don't know. I don't know. It would not surprise me if it had. Stats have always been that way. They're just now being reported. I would be surprised if like when our grandparents were kids, it was one in four. You know what I mean? I really like, like if we could have actually gotten behind the scenes and found out the truth, would it have been that low? Would it have been that high one in four, one in five? So I think two things play into this. Two very significant things play into this. One is I do think probably because of addiction and sexual addictions and stuff like that, it wouldn't surprise me if the rates are higher that more men are predatory just because they've been, I don't mean this in an excusatory sense, trained since childhood to think of them to be predatory with women because certainly there are men who have engaged in pornography who aren't predatory. Those things don't have to go hand in hand by any means. And how much of it is, the consequences of being a predatory man is so much less than it was in our grandparents day. Oh, interesting. So, because all that we have now is legal, which even those legal and the legal as we took that were, we actually talked about this in staff meeting. Yeah, it's unbelievable. Just measured in the number of months, not the number of years, decades or bullets assigned to people who are sexual predators, men who are sexual predators. And so I think there are a lot of factors with that too. And so it may be that predatory, the men who are predatory or the men who are on the line of being predatory feel safer being predatory. Maybe that's part of their risk. In a legal sense. They feel like they're risking less. Well, they're less likely to get dragged off a horse and hung by news in the moment. That might be different than 50 years ago. Right, exactly. So it may be that our grandparents faced it, that they literally did face it differently, but I'm not convinced it may have just been better hidden. And it may be that the percentages hasn't meaningfully changed. I just don't know. I don't know the answer to that. And I don't know that anybody does. Because we don't have percentages. I mean, I don't know that anyone's, maybe they have, but I don't know. They've done meaningful research on the percentages decades ago. Yeah. I don't know. But it does. I mean, certainly I do think, as we talked about, actually talked about that in the book, is that I do think women have learned to disassociate or disconnect or disintegrate their identity from their sexuality, probably because of generations of sexual predation of being sexually unsafe. Because it doesn't take a lot. I mean, again, if we say 2%, 5%, 10%, I mean, make up a number and say 10% and go, therefore, there's only, what, three to four million predatory men in America? So that would be, that is shocking. I mean, if we had three or four million predatory bears wandering around in culture, we might be more afraid of bears. And so anyway, I do think it's shocking. I do think it's a huge issue and a huge problem in our culture. And it's even something we see even in the church setting, whether that's the Scandals and the Baptist Church or in the Southern Baptist Convention last year or things like that, that we see a lot of churches and people in the name of Jesus not handling it well. But here's the deconstruction part of this. If it is that six out of seven women would rather meet a random bear than a random man in the woods, and then they're being told that they need to pick one of these men and submit to him, is that a deconstruction factor? Does this, you know, we talked about the, you know, the, is the Bible sexist? And I think we unpack that really well. And I'd encourage anybody to go back and listen to that. But I think there's an intuitive aspect of this that's still very powerful. If you grew up in a, you know, a strongly paternal, sorry, paternalistic, not just paternal, but paternalistic home, whether that was your mom teaching that or your dad teaching that or the church teaching that, and that man wasn't safe. Yeah, kind of like tyrannical. Yeah, exactly. But it's more tyrannical and that men are, I don't know, entitled, entitled to be tyrannical. Man, you start putting some of those pieces together and very quickly Christianity becomes something easy to do. Well, I mean, even the idea of Jesus as a man probably is hard too, if that's the case. Yeah. Well, and there's so many, like you're saying, there's so many layers to it because with our students, we've been studying like authority, the authority of God and the authority structure. And even going through that, there's so many topics that we've been trying to handle since in a sensitive way. But realizing that so much of how students are able to hear some of these messages probably depends on things like that, like their home structure, other messages that they have even been taught or just have been the norm in their homes. And I think you're right. I think even with like cults of Christianity, what we've seen a lot is that a, you know, truth has been mixed with a lot of really deceptive and convincing lies. And then men have used authority to control, you know, women and children and their families. And so it's like those concepts that are biblical and beautiful, like a lot of things we've talked about. But when they're distorted and used for power, then, and then women who are trying to obey God and do, you know, I was watching a real, I can't even like go into the details. It made me so angry, but there, it was basically a husband and wife who were in a cult and he was talking about the things they discovered in scripture about what the wife owes her husband and like all those conversations. And it was very blasphemous. Like he was just like the level that he went to of saying, yeah, scripture says this and this. And it's like, if you read the Bible at all, I mean, it wasn't even a misunderstanding. It was like, there, that is nowhere in scripture, but he, and she was just sitting there like, yeah, I take your word for it because you're my authority put in place by God. And a lot of, I think what happens is a lot of times women want to to do what's right, want to obey God, but then they've had that, those generations of being taught. This is what it means to be a godly woman. This is what it means to follow God. And then I think you're right. Later, when they finally get to a breaking point or when something changes and they realize what's happened, then it does cause deconstruction because it's all linked together. And it's not like, I mean, you could speak to this as a psychologist better than I could, but it's not like you can separate it and be like, Oh yeah, my husband who said he follows God says this, this, and this, but God, at that point, it's all like my husband was speaking for God who was trying to lead our family in a godly way. And it was, you know, and he abused it, whatever it was. And then that's how she's viewing God and what God calls wives to and, and all of it together. Sorry, I just went on a very long monologue, but I know that monologue is exactly what I think is the issue here is that I think Christianity and Christ himself. So a lot of, so you'll know a lot of men are reading this and immediately saying, but I'm not, I'm not like that. Why are you lumping me in with, you know, two to 10% of other men who might be predatory? You would be like, what's wild is I would love for, like now I want to turn it into a psychological study. Like, okay, it's your dad. It's your bear. It's your dad or a bear. It's, it's statistically, it's a randomized sampling. The man is going to be a man you already know. Now, which do you want? And like, I want to do a whole bunch of follow-up questions to find out like psychologically, what is the brokenness that's going on in our culture that would create this? What is it about men that men need to learn from this that we're not listening well enough or we're not policing other men well enough? Like when someone says like, well, you need to learn to listen to women better. And I'm like, I think I do. I really work hard at that. I try to do that. I want to understand and I want to get it. And, and I would, I would want every woman who knows me to say, well, I hope it's, I hope it's Chris who randomly is there in the woods. Like that's what I would want is that you would go like, well, if it's going to be Chris, then I wouldn't want to bear. Of course not. I'd much rather have him. Right. And so like, this is the, how do we get there? And is there something that men can be doing? But just think about Christianity gets caught up with the abuse of men and, or when men get authority because of some of the teachings in scripture about, for example, husbands being the head of the home, being the lead sacrificer in the home. And, and so that stuff gets taught. And so it automatically, God being a revealing himself as a he, which has nothing to do, of course, with his genetics or his plumbing, but, but with, as a he in some significant sense, that matters. We don't know exactly how, but is that a, how often do people lump those in and say, well, you know, I would rather, I'd rather not have a random man find me in the woods. I'd rather have a random bear, but Christianity essentially means being surrounded by random men. And I've got to somehow defer to their leadership. Yeah, I agree. And I think all the pictures of intimacy with God also break down. Because subconsciously he doesn't seem safe either. So all these pictures of protection and love and, you know, just like his presence being inescapable in some ways, I think that can be something that I don't know that anyone would say, yeah, that's scary. But if you're associating authority with something that has been really scary, that seems like it would translate to me of like, yeah, I don't, I don't want that, you know. Interesting. So if authority, especially masculine authority, isn't safe. And by the way, there was, I mean, there, you can look online, there are so many different follow ups about like, if I got attacked by a bear and I came back to town, no one would ask me what I was wearing. Did I trigger the attack somehow people would believe me that I was attacked by a bear. Like a lot of it is a cultural criticism more than it is even a criticism just of men. It's a cultural criticism like that. No one believes me. If I say a man attacked me in the woods, but if I say a bear did, everyone believes me. And, or, or if it did happen, somehow it must be my fault. Right. Exactly. It goes back to like the over-sexualization of women that even the church has adopted of like, somehow it's your fault because, you know, there's a sexual aspect to that, you know what I mean? Right. Yeah. So how do we, I think there is a great, I think there's a lesson here. I don't know that we know yet exactly what it is, but I think it is a, an important conversation with, with maybe the, the women in our culture is how do we, how do we, as we've talked about, how do we become atheists to this false version? How do we deconstruct our faith in humans and be okay with that and not have to deconstruct our faith in God equivalently? And how do we learn? Oh, sorry. No, you're good. Go, please. Well, and how do I think, how do we, it goes back to, I think we mentioned this last episode, but it goes back to our tendency for, if something has been mistaught or has been distorted, then to swing to the opposite side instead of coming back to scripture. And I think that's really important in this situation of like, no, that doesn't mean we throw out the roles in marriage. That doesn't mean we throw out the word submission. It means we go back to scripture and actually dig into what those mean in a really God honoring and healthy way. Because that is our first response is just, we're going to throw out everything that's been done poorly. And, and instead coming back to scripture and saying like, no, God, God designed, God is perfect. He's good. He's loving. He designed these things for our good and not for our oppression. So let's, let's, yeah, dismantle the things that have been taught poorly, but then not just swing to the opposite side in our own wisdom instead of coming back to scripture and saying like, how did God actually intend this? And I think there's, there's, there's something that we may be able to unpack. I think there's a lot of avenues to this that we can continue to unpack that people are talking about in culture, but one of them in my mind is the idea that because there are some men that are predatory and because women are less powerful in general. So like there is a potential for an oppressor oppressed conversation there. That doesn't mean that because you are a male, then you're an oppressor just because you have more power over women or that God calls you to a role. It doesn't mean that therefore all men are oppressors and therefore no men can speak into this issue. And I think that's what I've seen a lot in culture of that's one of the extreme swings that, and it makes sense. Like it, it makes sense that that would be a knee jerk reaction. But I think we, like you're saying part of the solution to this, and we're not saying that we're covering all the solutions right now, but part of the solution is like other men standing up to this issue. Um, not women separating from men and saying, therefore we don't need you anymore because some of you have messed this up. Does that make sense? Yeah. But yeah, what, what, uh, when we live in a, when we live in a culture that says just because you are a male, you could be an oppressor. Okay. But then to follow up and say, and it feels to women like statistically, you probably are, or it's not worth the risk. Um, maybe that's the way it should be worded. It's not worth the risk that you might be. That is a, there's something very, very broken, obviously there. Like that's, that's a major issue. If again, I don't know how this would play out. If you created an actual, like there's an actual bear, you know, roaring in the next room and some random guy, and we're going to leave you alone with one of them for an hour in a cage or in a whatever, like all these different factors. But, but I think what's been revealed is very clear and is very powerful. And I think it's something that we in the church need to recognize is that we need to be part of the solution to this. And how do we training young men and young women to engage in this conversation? And how are we training young men to be agents of safety and dignity and humility that, that, that the scripture calls us to be, by the way, that the Bible does call us to be. And are we teaching that well to young men so that over the next generation, I mean, as a pastor, I'm thinking, man, this, this creates an opportunity at a church that if women are looking for this type of safe place, and we've also been trying to get, we want men to come to church too. You know, it's something that made the church safe in the past was that men rarely came. And that would be, and so we worked hard to get men back in the church. And yet, how do we then make sure it's a safe place for the women? And when, because there could be a predatory male who shows up, or when we spot, when we discover that, how do we engage with that? And anyway, I just feel like there's a lot of really good questions that come from this. And I really especially wanted to get obviously your perspective as a woman as to, and even it's, it's intriguing that even a woman who's well trained and well prepared would still say, would still have the tendency to say one, I probably would end up saying I'd rather have a random bear and at the same time, and then say, and yet I know that's a weird answer when it's not the weird answer. Apparently it's the massively common answer. I'm just trying to wrap my brain around it some more and more to understand. I mean, you guys know I did, that was my staff little project last week was this war on women conversation. I'm trying to wrap my brain around that. I feel like culture is trying to divide out our culture along those lines so that people who, who might be a safe place to help with either a predatory man or a bear, as far as that goes, is not someone you're looking off to. Yeah. And I think you're right. I think a lot of questions come from it that we may be able to unpack. I mean, even right now, like there's a lot of pushback on the purity movement because of conversations like this and different things that have been taught under the auspice of Christianity, like modesty. And we've had those conversations on staff, but I think there's a lot here that we could unpack and we may be able to in future episodes. But yeah, it is a complex topic, but I think you're right that we have to tackle it if we are going to, I mean, for multiple reasons, but to continue to do life together as the body of Christ and have healthy marriages and families and healthy churches. I think we have to. Right. And then to be a voice in the solution with that. Right. Like, okay, if we're going to do that, then we need to be able to understand the issues and then speak to the truth of them. Yeah. I can help them. Very good. Well, and I certainly think one is let's teach what the Bible actually teaches about this, about being an authority as a Christian. Like from Mark chapter 10 means we are the ones who serve, we are the ones who sacrifice first. That's what, that's really what authority is all about in the Christian world. It's not the opportunity to abuse or take advantage of. It's not, we don't lord it over other people. Christ who has the ultimate authority did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped because he already had that. He had that authority. He had that position. And yet his response to that was to come and die for a race that needed him, not that he needed us. And that's actually the image then that the apostle Paul later says that a marriage should look like, as the husband should be diligently working hard to sacrifice and young men are supposed to be in training for those roles. So anyway, just so much here and we've got to get back to teaching some of these things rightly and recognizing that it is a tough conversation. It can be complex. Yeah. And so I would say if, you know, if you're a listener and you have specific questions regarding this, please send us an email. Or if there's like, Hey, maybe a story that has helped you or a story that you want to share, like this is, this really has made it difficult for me. One way or another, we'd love to, we'd love to hear it in that, in the, in the hopes that we could help other people understand this and we could be a part of that solution and part of the conversation toward that solution. And then the other side of things, as Chris talked about, we do have older episodes about, is the Bible oppressive to women? Is the Bible sexist? And so if that is an interesting conversation that you haven't listened to yet, but it piques your interest, I would encourage you to go and listen back to that. Anything else guys, as we wrap this up? Not for now. I would say if anybody who's out there, if you're facing this type of oppression or abuse or whatever, our encouragement is that you get help. There are lots of great options. Obviously, I mean, we can help, we could help you find those if you need to reach out to us, but there are much quicker ways to do that. Hotlines and other opportunities, local authorities, please get help. Justice is a part of what God calls us to and that we live out in our families and in our churches and in other settings. And so it's okay to seek out help knowing that there may be consequences for abusers or predators. That's okay. That's not your responsibility to protect abusers or predators from the consequences of their sins against you. And yeah, anyway, I think this is a good start to the good continuation of this conversation. Yeah, I would even say in addition to that, just because I've run into this conversation a lot with friends of even if you don't feel like it's outright abuse, but you feel like you're being manipulated. Like if you're like, am I being emotionally abused? Like I don't, even if it's one of those things where you're like, something seems off, but I don't want to make a big deal of it. Like maybe I'm just being dramatic. Like if you're being gas lit, a lot of times you think that it's your fault, but still in the back of your mind, you feel like your relationship's not healthy or something's not quite right. Like I would say still reach out to people and get advice and opinions and don't feel like you're being dramatic just because you're wondering those things like pursue second opinions and answers and things like that. So absolutely. Very good. Yeah, sweet. Well, this is good. It's a good conversation, engaging with what's going on right now in the culture and hopefully understanding why. So thanks guys.
