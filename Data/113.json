We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined as always by my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg. And Chris has a current event that me and Bryn are not aware of the context or the content. And so I'm excited about hearing about this and then what this means for our episode today. So you listener, you're experiencing this a little after us, but with kind of the same mentality. So with that, Chris, I'm going to throw it over to you. Okay. And now bring us up to speed. Okay. Last time we did this, we talked about bears in the woods. I know it was the bears and the yeah, which was a great, by the way, a great episode. I just got to say not to pat us on the back or anything, but I thought that was a great episode. All right. So about 10 days ago, Pope Francis was speaking at the Singapore's Catholic junior college and he said this, all religions are a path to reach God. They are, I make a comparison like different languages, different idioms to get there, but God is God for everyone. And since God is God for everyone, we are all children of God, but my God is more important than yours. Is this true? There's only one God and our religions are languages paths to reach God. Some are Sikh, some are Muslim, some are Hindu, some are Christians, but they are different paths. I thought we did an episode on universalism. That kind of sounds like that to me. Yes. I mean, it's always just telling the line, isn't he? Well, I think he's done towing the line. Whoa. I mean, towing the line, meaning he kind of goes back and forth. Like he's like, all right, I'm a Catholic. And then he'll like step over the other side. So can we, can we really quick, uh, there are some people listening to this who have a great understanding of who the Pope is. Okay. Can, can you tell us what the Pope is and what, what he means to the Catholic church and then how this is so, why this is a little bit like what? Yeah, that's okay. So, um, so the back a long, long time ago, around the year 1000, um, and I'm going to give some rough estimates here, but around the year 1000, the Catholic church Catholic means unified on that the, the Roman Catholic church separated off from the Orthodox church. Um, this had been building for a while. There were eight bishops originally and the Roman bishop became the most powerful, um, over time. And in fact, he became what I thought was one of the most hilarious phrases ever, the first among equals. Um, and so I've even heard people try to use that in other settings. I'm like, I don't think that ever works. Um, I mean, unless you mean like first in line, like he just happens to be first, like all the batters are equal. You're first on the lineup. That doesn't mean you're best. You're just first among you. Okay. I can see it there, but it's like outsiders perspective. It definitely doesn't seem like that's the case. No, exactly. Well, and, and the others argued that that wasn't the case. Rome was the most powerful nation. So of course the Bishop of Rome would be the most powerful Bishop is how the Bishop of Rome saw it. The others didn't see it that way. This created a lot of the medieval struggle, um, including, you know, the later crusades and stuff really were, were started in, in this conflict and these issues. So, um, so the Roman church then, uh, said, actually our Bishop is Papa. He is the father for everybody. And that's what Pope means is just Papa. That's all that means. And there's always been a chief father of the church. Now there always has been, they then worked their way backwards all the way to the apostle Peter and said that Peter was the first Pope and that the Pope has been a line of men from the time of the apostle Peter. And the apostle Peter is the one who allegedly had the gate, the keys to hell. And so the keys to heaven and heaven. Jesus said, you're Peter and on my rock, I'll build this church. That's where they, that's right. And the gates of hell will not stand against you. Right. Um, and, and there's another reference to the, actually I'll look it up while we're sitting here because if that feels a little reaching, um, but is there more like, but they viewed themselves as the church at the time, like capital T H or capital T H. What happened is so slowly, so it's Matthew 16, 18. Um, okay. And I tell you, you are Peter and on this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. And he strictly charged the disciples till till no one that he was the Christ. So, um, other, other denominations would say that, that that second phrase is for the apostles as a whole and the instruction he was sending them out into the world to his era as his representatives. That was not just somehow a special power Peter had, um, with the keys, these keys picture. So, um, anyway, so they said he, that was Pete, that's why Peter is always pictured at the pearly gates, by the way, it's a Roman Catholic teaching that he's the one with the keys that opens the door and he decides whether you get in or not. Um, he's the final voice on that kind of thing. Um, and so they said they went all the way back and then they take the passages like, you know, the people, people Catholic, I mean, that, uh, prophets and others spoke for God and said that the decision, the ability to speak for God now rested exclusively in this one person, um, who was the Pope and that the Pope could speak what's called ex cathedra. Um, and, and so from, I think it means literally the voice of God. What does that actually, um, ex cathedra means, uh, I knew, I want to make sure I'm saying it correctly that it actually means from the chair. Um, and so meaning from the special chair that he would like originally apparently set in the throne of the Pope. And then when he spoke and when he spoke from the chair, I'm representing God, then that meant what he said was infallible. And so when he spoke to issues of faith and morality, it was infallible. Um, and so that's where we get a lot of Catholic doctrines over the years that have been developed is that that's something that was decided by a Pope throughout history. And when he, so, and just make sure what I'm saying. So when he says something, he's not saying something just for himself. If he's speaking from the chair. Okay. Okay. So the Pope can offer up an opinion outside of that. Okay. But he always is the rep, the representative of the Catholic church or the Roman Catholic church. He speaks for the Roman Catholic church. Um, and so even when he, so he's at that point, what he was saying from Singapore in Singapore, he was not speaking for God, but he was speaking as the pontiff, the head of the Catholic of the Roman Catholic church. That's what I was going to say. Cause isn't it is more now ceremonial. And so in a lot of ways it is more on behalf of the church, which isn't, I guess, fully ceremonial, but not so much viewed as from the mouth of God as it was in the past. Is that correct? Say that again. Like it's more his role. The view of his role has shifted somewhere. Now it's more like, yeah, this is the view of the church. Not so much of like, this is God speaking as it was in the past. Um, maybe, but he still has the authority to sit in the throne and speak for God. Okay. He could still do that. He would still have that option of, uh, for, for faithful Catholics. He could still step in and say, no, this, this is the statement of morality. And I'm, I am speaking that as the, as, as the voice of God, um, from the chair. Now, obviously popes you are, you are correct in understanding. I think that popes do that much less often. And I don't remember when was the last time when was the last, um, a Pope spoke. This is now I don't, I don't expect any of us to be Catholic experts. So we, but these are things we can easily look up. Um, 1854 and 1950. Um, so that's, those are the, the definition of Papal infallibility. Anyway. Um, there's a different opinion. The gosh, there's different answers on how many times that has happened. That's intriguing. Um, so I don't expect, I know at least two, but that's happened. But what we're saying is when we pull a quote like that, that's not what we're talking about. This is just what he's saying, but it's still as the head of the Roman Catholic church. That's correct. It is significant. Oh, it's a huge deal. Yes. Beliefs. Um, representative. Yeah. Of the Catholic faith. Because he's still supposed to represent what the Catholic faith believes. Right. Cause in my mind, whether or not he is sitting on the chair. Okay. Right. If he, if he is held in that esteem to some people, it probably feels like, well, this is what God would say anyway. Yes. Right. That's that is exactly well, or that it should be what God would say. Right. He is. It isn't so much that he is officially speaking for God. He's just speaking for God. Right. He has that, um, influence on people. And so now this is an interesting question because one, I could see this being confusing to someone who for years has said, I'm Catholic. I would want to be Catholic, but my parents have told me my whole life that, that you can't be Catholic and believe that all religions are the same. Mm-hmm. And, and people have even probably been, you know, kicked out of or removed from, from fellowship with people over this issue that the Catholic church is not, does not believe this. You can't be Catholic and believe that all religions are just like different languages. Now I will say also, uh, Brynn, one of the things you said that this Pope has been famous for doing is saying stuff and he actually says it. And then all kinds of people come out after him and say, no, no, no, that's not, that's not what he was saying or that's not exactly what he meant or whatever. And I'm sure he says, he says stuff that's more controversial for a Pope, right? Yes, that's right. And so, and so there's going to be, there's always people who come out afterwards, sometimes even represented his own representatives come out and say, that's, that's not what he said or that's not what he meant or, or that kind of thing. That's been a, that's been a huge issue, um, from the perspective of like the LGBTQ movement and that kind of stuff and, and what his perspective is. Right, right. That's what I was thinking of. Um, and so he will say something that sounds very clearly like something and then someone later will say, no, that's, that's not, that's not what he intended to say. That wasn't his perspective and it's created a real, I mean, there's definitely created some real conflict and, and confusion among the Catholic world, um, for sure. Yeah. Um, well, that's why I was saying, part of my question earlier was, is it my understanding, and this could be wrong, um, but isn't it true that the way that people view the Pope now has changed from the past. So some people in the Catholic church still view him more traditionally of like speaking for God and being the head of the church. And then some people view him more as like a ceremonial role of, um, you know, like he represents something, but doesn't hold as much authority as in the past. Like maybe I'm wrong about that, but it seems like there are those two views being held. Right. No, I think, I think that definitely is a given that some people, um, some people have had that perspective for sure. And that that perspective has changed. I don't know what the general, like what percentage of, uh, Catholics have switched from seeing him as kind of a, an old wise man, you know, like a Gandhi wise figure, you know, that kind of thing. But I'm sure it's an incredibly high number in the same way that a lot of people have gone from seeing the scripture, seeing the whole, the Bible as holy scripture. That's authoritative versus just a book with some pretty good wise statements in it. So now then that we've unpacked a little bit about what, what the background is, can we talk a little bit more about like, cause I know we've talked about universalism. We've talked about this, but what is him saying that? What does that mean? Yeah, I think that's part, that's the second part. I think for us to describe is, is to, to really dig into is what do we believe about this statement that all religions are paths to God. And so for us to be able to have the conversation in, in what sense is that statement true? And in what sense is that statement false? I think is one that we can unpack and maybe uniquely so. So I would, I would love to, you know, to unpack that a little bit. We've, like you said, we've talked about universalism, but this is an interesting version of universalism that says that all, it isn't like, it isn't that all humans end up in with God someday in heaven or whatever. This is more what's considered like ecumenical, meaning it isn't, you have to be religious. Yeah, but it, but all the religions, but all the religions will are like different languages describing the same thing. Yeah. Okay. So how would we, let's unpack that a little bit. Go ahead. Well, it's interesting because we are going through this series on Wednesday night, you know, with like a lot of worldview questions. And the one that we did with students on Wednesday was, um, uh, now I'm going to forget, but basically talking about this concept and the other illustration that's really common is, you know, the one about the elephant of like, all the blind men. And that's like what this reminds me of, of like, really, really, can you tell the story? Can you tell the little analogy? Yeah, I think so. Like there's a story about, um, a bunch of blind men who all interact with an elephant and, but they all interact with different parts of the elephant. And so they describe what an elephant is like differently. So one like feels the leg and is like, Oh, an elephant is like a tree. Um, someone else runs into the side and it's like an elephant is like a wall. Um, one feels the trunk and says, an elephant is like a snake. And so all making the point of they see different parts of it, but it's all parts of the whole. Um, but then Mary Lee who was teaching pointed out like, but actually if you break it down, they're all inaccurate in their view of what an elephant is because an elephant is not a wall or a snake or anyway, but that's like an illustration that's used a lot for similar things or like a similar idea. Yeah. We're like, but we just talked about this is our interaction with God. And so, right, right. It's just like one part of it perspective. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just interesting to me. They're all wrong is an interesting connection to that. Um, one is that they're all wrong. And the other one is which, uh, Paul talked about that with the adults as well about this either week, last week or the week before that. And, uh, I think, so I think one of the things that Paul pointed out was the evil of the sighted people, Paul, executive pastor, executive teaching pastor. Thank you. Um, of, uh, the evil of the sighted people who were present allowing, um, this interaction to happen the way that it was happening. Um, in fact, in the original story, it's like, there was a, there's a sighted man who brings an elephant to a bunch of blind men. And, and it's like the, the, the evil of people who would not speak into like, no, no, you've only got one part of the elephant and, and helping them see the full picture. There's actually a version of this that one of my counselors at Alathea really likes. That's called the, I think it's called seven blind mice or something like that. And it's all mice running over an elephant. And then there is one mouse who starts going from mouse to mouse to mouse, gathering the information and then compiles it into one answer. Um, and so that's, that's the picture that, but the analogy obviously falls apart. It's broken and all analogies do fall apart. Um, it's broken in a lot of ways, but is that what religion is, is there a God and each of us is saying, Oh, we each have a different aspect of the same God in my mind. What, what really throws that off so badly is one. So can you be wrong about it? So, so what if you reach over into the air two feet to the left of the elephant and say, there is no elephant. So are you right? Well, you are correct that that's your experience, but you are not correct as to the nature of the fact that there is an elephant. And I think maybe that's what you said, Mary Lee, or one of our other staff members was teaching on that was yeah, that's, that is incorrect. Elephants are not like tree trunks. You're, you're wrong. Well, they're like snakes. Nope. You're wrong too. Like, can we say that? Like that's, that's the opposite of ecumenical. The story of the, the, the parable of the people finding the elephant is that all of them are wrong, not that all of them are right. And so to me, that's intriguing is that that story falls apart in this religion or the assumption that yeah, you can still find God through a different way. Right. It's just the whole, like when it goes back to the languages though, cause he like list in the quote, he didn't, he list multiple religions. He like, there are, which is like Muslims, Hindu Christian. Yes. Which is so interesting to me. Cause I'm like, when you're, when you get down to listing specific religions and then it's, it's almost like, have you, do you have knowledge of these religions? Because it goes back to the same question of like, if you lay out the qualities of God and what he is like from those religions, there's no possible way that they can all be the same God. Like that's not, that doesn't like the fact that he would say that he believes that is really interesting to me because it seems easy to disprove. Right. And it seems like, and this is kind of like, I can't, we can't judge his heart, but it seemed like this on some of his other comments. It seems like he's really leaning into what people want to hear, which is such an interesting stance for a Pope. Um, because it's like, yeah, that, that is the least offensive way of saying that. But I mean, when you lay it out at all, when it comes to what God is like from all of those religions, there's no possible way that they can all be true. Well, yeah. That's part of the question is, is it, what does it mean to say an elephant is like a fan and another one to say, no, an elephant is like a tree trunk. Well, obviously those cannot both be true. An elephant can have features like those, but you can't define it. What happens if, if the two statements are contradictory? Right. And so what happens if it's, if they directly oppose each other, that the elephant is this and the elephant is that, and those are opposites from each other, then what do you do? What do you do with that? And I'd love to know the Pope's perspective on that. So God is father. God is not father. And so, okay, how are those the same God? Either he isn't or he is or he isn't. And are you saying, well, my experience of him is as father and my experience of him as not as father. Okay. I'm fine with that. Absolutely. So which is it? Right. My God says that the only way to him is Jesus, but other people's version of him says that there are many ways to him. Right. And it's like, wait. Yeah. Yeah. So they're contrary. Anytime you have contradictions, you don't both get to be right. You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. What he means is this. Right. Which is such an interesting thing. This is like, once again, we don't know his heart, but to think about a Pope being a moral relativist is like such an interesting concept of like, what if he actually believes this that kind of leans toward moral relativism, right? And just kind of like, as long as you're sincere, you're right. And that's like such an interesting stance from a head of a religion, of a primary world religion. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a definitely a serious issue. By the way, there today's no, what's today? Oh, it's today at six 30. Amy, he posted on X this morning. The world is made up of many different realities that are diverse precisely so they can assist and complete each other. When they are harmonized, all generations, peoples and differences can reveal the wonderful splendor of humanity and creation. So he uses a different analogy, right? This time the analogy is about harmony. So to me, that strikes me as the, the problem is what if you're singing different songs? Can you harmonize if you're singing different songs? I don't know. That's that. Did the Catholic, did the Catholic church walk this back at all? Like, did they clarify this statement when it, you know, I have not had the time to dig that up. Yeah. I was curious. Um, I found an article that I had looked at it. What did the path, what did, and this is what I was looking for. What did the Pope really say about religions as paths to God? And I haven't got to read it, but I have a funny feeling is, is it's going to be, did he really say this? And in the end it's going to be kind of like, no, he didn't really say this. Um, anyway, every religion is a way to arrive at God. All religions are pathways to reach God. Um, remember he's speaking, not, he's, he's speaking in a different language. He's not speaking in English. And so there has to be a translation and they're going to really play up that. But I, I think it's clear that he is making the statement that he believes that all religions are pathways to God. And, and so in one sense, certainly all religions are an effort. Like it is an effort to like be a pathway to God. Like that's what they're trying to do. Um, just like every, you know, everybody has this perspective forever on everybody has their own perspective. This is the right way to get to God. But again, I, I'm a big fan of the belief that, that religions are not about us trying to find God our best way, best ways, but it's about trying to unpack God's way of getting to know him. What is his opinion on the matter? And, and that's what religion is supposed to be is trying to unpack what is, what is his opinion on religion. That's what matters to me. And that's what I'm trying to find out. Not what is my opinion. Here's, here's an interesting, here's an interesting article from Benedictine or Benedictine college in Atchison, Kansas. This is from September 17th says, did Pope Francis just say all religions are equally true? This person who wrote it, Tim Hoops, I wrote a whole book about the need to be clear about what Pope Francis really said. As I say in the book, there are three simple steps Catholics can take when they are troubled by what the Pope said. First, double check the catechism. So this is what is often the troubling quotations, things Pope Francis says, or just paraphrases of the catechism. What I quoted above about salvation is from number 846 of the catechism, which comes right before it and right after it are also important right before it. The church teaches about truth and other faiths and says about Muslims together with us. They adore the one merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day. Right after that, the catechism teaches those who through no fault of their own do not know the gospel of Christ or his church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart are moved by grace, trying their actions to do as well as they know and know it through the dictates of their conscience. Those two may achieve eternal salvation. The second point he says, after checking the catechism, check the context and third, follow the Pope, adding whatever details of the faith you think are important. Those are his three points. So how does he apply those points or does he apply those points to this specific situation? In this case, so this is after checking the catechism, check the context. In this case, Pope Francis is showing us that when it comes to sharing the faith with non-believers, we should stress first what they get right, not what they get wrong. Jesus himself did this with the woman at the well, making sure to also stress that he is the one salvation. So did he do that? I mean, I don't remember. I've not listened to the whole speech. Does he at some point say it doesn't say. I've looked that up. Okay. The others didn't follow the Pope last. If you think the Pope left something out or said something unclearly, then maybe the Holy Spirit is urging you to action. Go and do what the Pope did, encounter people that don't know Jesus Christ and share your love of Christ with them, adding the teachings of the church you think he missed. Catholics have the obligation and the right to evangelize all, as the catechism puts it. Or as Pope Francis said, there is a kind of preaching which falls to each of us as a daily responsibility. It has to do with bringing the gospel to the people we meet, whether they are neighbors. Wow. So it's like, yeah, it's not as clear, but it's also like, he's going to say things. Yeah, that's actually one of the other sites I'm looking at actually says that, like what the Pope says when he's just being just talking, doesn't bother me because he's just a man when he's just talking. Versus, you know, when he governs, that's when the guy says all bets are off when he starts governing, making decisions for everybody. Interesting. We treated all politicians like that. Right, right. But church leaders, that is treating him as a politician. And if that's all the Pope is, we need to be clear on that. Yeah. Rather than an authority. Right. But we don't even treat politicians like that. It's almost like a celebrity. Yep. You know, like what he says in his personal life is like, we're like off the record. Yeah. Which he wasn't technically off the record, but you know. So one, I think this could easily be very confusing to people. The fact that, okay, religion can change this much. But like you can be, no, no, this is absolutely not what we teach. We do not teach that all religions are just like languages, etc. Right. That's one. That's confusing. If you then come along later and go like, no, just kidding. That actually is fine. You can actually be the Pope and believe that. Like, oh, okay. Well, you can be the Pope and believe it anyway. So that's one. But two, I actually think it's a problem because it oversimplifies the concept of religion in a way that is inappropriate. And it's, I think it's really almost insulting to people who really are searching, who really are deconstructing and trying to reconstruct to go, I'm, I'm trying to discover and trying to unpack what is the truth here. And, and what you're telling me now is either there is no truth or they are all truth. Mm hmm. And that, that's very confusing as well. So in other words, even if they contradict each other, they're real still, they're still really the same thing. And so there is no such thing as abstract truth. Um, that seems super confusing to me as well. And then finally, like you said, the issue of these religions do not coordinate. There's like from a logical standpoint, just looking at them. That is right. They don't, they don't, they don't coexist perfectly. There are senses in which they do there. Things are the same. It isn't that they all contradict in every way. And I think that's a healthy way to come at that, by the way. I think, let me see, as Lewis talked about that years ago, that there is a totally appropriate way to, um, to understand, of course, some religions are closer to the truth than the other. And, and we're not perfect in our understanding of even our religion. We, we humbly are willing to, able and willing to accept that. But that doesn't mean that things that contradict each other are, um, are still the same thing. They are equally valid. And that to me is disturbing and confusing. If not insulting. Yeah. I think, I think it's a good delineation to make. There's, there's a difference between finding common ground with other people in order to have beneficial conversations with them. Like that's one thing. Um, but that's not the same as, um, admitting that all truth is equal. All of it is the same. Basically it's all just a different version. Like those are two different, they seem similar in passing, but they're not, you know, right. And I think one is helpful and appropriate for Christians. And then the other, like you're saying is not even like on just like scrolling through Reddit, a lot of Catholics are really frustrated by this. Cause they're like, why does it matter that I'm a Catholic? Like from the Pope's perspective, um, you know, like why just asking those questions of like, why does it matter to pick anything? Um, you know, why does it matter to seek truth at all? Yeah. If I can pick anything or if I don't, and another, another thing was saying, like this person was making, uh, this is a, the Catholic world report. And it was saying when the Pope says all religions are path to God, I think we need to cut him some slack since it in context, what he was, uh, alluding to were the major higher religions of the world, much of which he goes on to specifically name some seek some Muslim, some Hindu, some Christian. So no, I do not think the Pope would view bail worship, Moloch worship, and modern Satanism has passed to God. The word all in this context is one of those ambiguities we often see when the Pope speaks extemporaneously. And I think that it needs to be interpreted charitably in its context, but I'm like, but that's not what he said. Even, even so, I'm totally happy to say the only ones he meant were seek Muslim, Hindu, Christian, right? Okay. Right. So I would just love to hear him teach a seminar on how to integrate those. Um, and I have how they're all able to be true. Yeah. How they're all able to be true simultaneously, how they're able to be paths to the same God. When the people who the person, the person or persons they describe as God aren't the same. I mean, it's, that's a, they are more or less correct. Like that's a, uh, more or less true. And I would, again, so for him to come back, I think it would be intriguing if he had come back and said, um, Hey, I just, just to be clear on this, I think all of these are an effort to find God. And I honor that. And, and yet at the same time, I would say, obviously only Catholicism is the only trustworthy source or like different ways he could talk about this, but it is intriguing. And I just, for me, from a, from a deconstruction reconstruction perspective, it is, to the thought of is, so if I am someone in the midst of deconstruction, the main problems for me would be if this feels dishonest or insulting, um, or, or defeating maybe even like, like that it's like, I don't even fully, I don't even understand how this, like how any of this works, but it feels insulting. Like, so you're saying the fact that your faith has these contradictions, your answer to that is like, I don't own them and I don't have to explain them. And if I was a, an atheist or, or, you know, that version of skeptic, I would be like, that's yeah, good try. You don't get out of it that easily. Yeah, it doesn't seem like a reasonable thing. Um, and yeah. And then the, then it's like, so you're just acknowledging, are you admitting and owning that your religion is not reasonable? Is that what you're telling me? Because then own that and then we can be done with it. And I can just accept that it's an unreasonable faith that you're claiming. I'm supposed to accept contradictions on the face of it and go, okay, cool. So you just don't believe in anything reasonable or true. And I, so I, this is why I disagree with this. It's not because I don't like, seek religion, the Muslim religion or the Hindu religion, though I probably would actually do them kind of in that order. Um, I actually think the seek religion is fascinating. I love the seek religion. It's amazing how many Americans think the seek are Muslims. Did you guys ever see, um, um, Annie as a kid or anything? So, uh, Punjab is a seek, uh, not, not Muslim. And in fact, the seek are considered themselves ancestral enemies of Muslims. Like it's not a, they don't, they don't play well together in ways that are even beyond some of the others. Which that was, that was what I was also thinking is like, okay, I wonder if he, if he is playing to a specific crowd, if the, because I don't know the full context of who he was talking to, but it's like, to me, those groups probably wouldn't be like, you know what, he's right. Like to me, a, a Sikh, a Muslim and a Hindu, they are so, and I'm, I understand I'm generalizing here, but most of them would be convinced that they're the way to go. But in a very religious way, it's like, well, we're right though. Right. Am I, am I saying the Hindu, the Hindu only the seek faith, I'd have to research the seek faith again to understand what its view is on exclusivity. I feel like it may not be a super exclusive. Okay. So it might be better. It might be more open. Um, although again, probably not with Islam is Hinduism is certainly an open religion. Although you, I say that and know that like, wow, there, it's, there are a bunch of the, the conservative, if you will, the more fundamentalist Hindus do not believe that at all. And there's a real problem with fundamentalist Hindus running down, capturing and kidnapping and executing people in India right now, um, of different faiths, including Muslims by the way, and Christians. Um, but this is a, but certainly Christianity is pretty strongly, though we hopefully are loving in the midst of it. We also are a exclusion, exclusive faith. And we don't think there are multiple paths to God. Now God may decide to accept and have mercy on whoever he decides to, that's different, but the only path to God is through Christ. So we've had that, we've had that conversation. Yes, we have. Absolutely. And why we believe that. Um, and so it's not exclusive in that anyone can walk that path. Anyone can accept that free gift. That's the Christian view. Um, but, but that is certainly not the case for Islam. Um, but like you're saying, I think it's not have that boils down to if you're deconstructing or trying to reconstruct, it seems like it is a gesture of like attempted kindness of like, yeah, just setting people at ease, but inadvertently, yeah, is like insulting their intelligence in some way, or they're like seeking of truth. Um, because it's basically like minimizing that in some ways, it's like trying to encourage it, but it also could be viewed as minimizing it, which could be really discouraging for someone who's like, no, like I'm convinced there's a truth out there. I don't know what it is, but I'm trying to find it. Um, yeah, that seems like it could be really discouraging of like, Oh, well then it doesn't really matter. Like I, I can just kind of settle on anything. Yeah, I would be, I would be fascinated. It would be, this feels like one of those efforts that Christians sometimes make at, at being friends with everyone that a hundred percent of the time blows up. Like we're, we're, did, we're the seek. If there were any Sikh Muslims, Hindus in the room, did they go like, Oh, well then, then we can just all be friends. Cause the Pope, I mean, not, I don't mean friends. I mean, we all serve the same God. We can all just worship together. I can start going to the Catholic church just as easily as my Muslim church. Yeah. Like to the mosque, like, can I, can I go to the Catholic church then just as much as the Pope going to start showing up at mosques and stuff. And like, we're singing with us and worshiping with us and quoting the Quran with us. And I don't think anybody buys it. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, maybe I'm being inappropriate about this. Maybe there's a lot of people in the world who are comforted, like, Oh good, the Pope gets it. But I just have a hard time imagining that there are many people who were comforted by the Pope's thoughts. It just seems from at least the, the short Google search that we've done, at least people in the Catholic faith and voices in it are like, Oh, okay. Well, let's just see what he means by the context of it, rather than like accepting it as faith at face value. Yeah. I mean, like, this is actually super comforting. It's like, wait, wait, wait, hold on. You, I just need, you need to listen to what he says. He's, he is our leader, but then just decide kind of for yourself. Right. It's, it's, I don't know. It's a quandary. Yeah. And by the way, in evangelical churches and Protestant churches, that's exactly how we treat our religious leaders is what if they speak the truth, then we listen to it and we follow it and we learn. And when they speak something that isn't true, we go, yeah, just a guy or a girl like this. Humans are messed up that way. Um, and so just, evangelical church has, has also gone wrong. Some of like, you know, whole churches or denominations being led one way because they followed a man instead of God. Right. Yep. That is doctrinally unsound, um, to do it that way. So anyway, this is, this has been an interesting conversation and, and I just was curious, I don't know how many people have spotted it. How many people have heard about it? It got covered, covered up. Sounds conspiratorial. It vanished into the distractions of the rest of the world very quickly. But I think for us as Christians and people dealing with deconstruction and reconstruction, it was worth a conversation. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
