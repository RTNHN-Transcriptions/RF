We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. I'm Colson Lechner here with Chris Sherrod and Chris Legg. Today we're kind of backtracking a little bit in our definition series. We are tacking on to more information about truth and our definition of truth. Today specifically we're going to start off with some worldly theories or definitions on truth. So I'm going to throw it over first to Chris Legg. Chris, can you tell us a little bit about how this kind of came up for you and then we can jump into those theories that you've come across? Absolutely. Okay, so I'm doing some research for a worldview conference seminar thing we're hosting here at the church. I really want to focus, I want my talk to be totally about the nature of truth. So I'm trying to unpack and dig into all these different ways of understanding truth and engaging with truth. Because I think it's amazing to me that there is debate, there's not just debate about the nature of truth, which I can understand why that exists. There's debate about the reality of truth. I honestly kind of scratched my head, I don't mean to say truly in the sentence, I honestly kind of scratch my head in the midst of that all the time. Anyway, so I was doing some research and have found that there's kind of, depending on who you ask, of course, four or five, maybe six main theories on the nature of truth, what truth is. And I had heard these, but I didn't realize they'd been organized like this. And so I was curious to hear what you guys thought and shared what you thought on each of these. So I'm going to throw it out and try to do it without any editorial to start just kind of defining it and then let you all then let us kind of wrestle through it because I want you guys to have to deal with it like I did this way. So the first one and the most traditional one is called the correspondence theory. In other words, truth is what allows you to experience truth is the experience of what corresponds to reality. That's what truth is. Truth is something that corresponds to reality. Okay, so let me throw that one at you first. That's the correspondence theory for truth. Truth is what corresponds to reality. Go. I agree. Well, I mean, again, it's so much of this, I think is just logic where you just go. If you were, if Colson wanted to say it's snowing outside right now here, outside our building, that's a truth claim about objective reality right now that we're in. And if we open the window or go outside and it's not snowing, it's just false. But if we go outside and it is snowing, then your statement is true. It's corresponding to reality. So yeah, so it's pretty straightforward as far as that. I mean, I would say that's pretty much true. Okay, good. I have nothing to add. Is there a way that it gets twisted? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You know, you know, the philosophers aren't done yet. Yeah. Well, true. Okay. You mean that corresponds to reality, that that statement does that the philosophers aren't done yet? Sure. Okay, good. Okay. So the second one is interesting. The second one is coherentism, meaning coherentism, coherentism. And I'm not an expert on any of these. This would have been a great one to, you know, call in my son, the philosopher to kind of dig into these more deeply, because I'm familiar with what we talked about before that the discussion of, of epistemology, this study of what's knowable and the different sources of knowledge. And we discussed those. But this is the nature of truth itself. And coherentism says something is true if it is rational, whether or not it actually connects to a sense of reality or not. Meaning, can you, so, so for example, they would have said, the coherentist would say, if Colson says it's snowing outside, is that coherent? Meaning, is it true from a coherent perspective? And so this is an older school, almost rationalism mindset as in one way of understanding it is, can we, does it make sense given the nature of reality itself more than just does it a statement of reality? Is it true in a sense of connected to reality? So if I, if I assert something, like if I say this person is guilty, or innocent, what would we say, how would we together come to an agreement or based on certain rules of logic, whether or not that person was or not? Does that make sense? I, I, I, because of my acceptance of coherentism, I have a hard time not filing, I mean, of correspondence theory and coherentism, not filing them together. To me, it seems like one is they are both saying the same thing with just two different sources of information. But I don't, I don't know that that's actually accurate. Did you just unpack correspondence theory or no, that was coherentism. So how does, how does correspondence theory, is there an example? So of course, you gave almost the exact correspondence theory, the idea that that's the case. Okay. So what corresponds to reality and then something is true if it is rational, if it's rational, if it's logically sound. Okay. And that's, that's the argument. So, so you would say, for example, correspondence theory, this is where it gets tough for me because I'm such a rationalist that it's hard for me not to think of rational and reality as interchangeable terms. But so if you argued, there's such a thing as justice. So could you, could that be a correspondence theory? If I said there is such a thing as justice, then you would want to argue coherentism is justice coherent? Is the concept of justice coherent? Can I make a truth claim about something that is coherent like that? And again, I may be, I've still got to dig more into this. Somebody may be listening going, that's not the coherent theory. That's not exactly right. But I will tell you, watching several different people try to explain it, it was hard for me to delineate them. So it's maybe my limitations, but hard for me to delineate them because I think if something is rational, it is a description of reality. Yeah. Anyway, do y'all have any, any, y'all are stuck in the same place. I probably because I'm the teacher and I'm confusing it. Let me go ahead. No, I mean, just thinking, are they mainly talking about non physical things like love or numbers or you don't understand when they say, okay, coherentism is a belief is true in the case or to the extent that it coheres with the overarching system of beliefs. In other words, what we call true means it is coherent with all the other aspects of our belief. So it must be stronger than merely consistent. It has to cohere a set of beliefs when we so this is this is, I guess I should come at it this way. What do we mean when we use the word truth? That's what's being described here. And so some people would say we're just using a statement that corresponds to reality. It's knowing or it isn't knowing. Coherentism says, no, no, we're saying this, when I call something true, what I mean is it coheres with my overall belief system. It works within my belief system that's already there. It makes something that the whole system is coherent when I say something is true. That help at all? A little, but I still think then there's got to be something outside of my perception and your perception and Colson's perception that we can all three look at together, right? Because something can totally make sense in someone's head. Their reality that they've made up and would be consistent, but it doesn't mean that it's actually true. And it can have it can have laws. I mean, you can have history, you can have, you know, Narnia or Middle Earth with all this history and all of this, right? People and characters and stuff. But that that isn't in line with reality. So that would be, I guess the first view. But yeah, I guess I'm still struggling to figure out there's got to be some standard that we can all three go. I see what you mean. Or I, again, if I, if I'm saying something is true, what I'm saying is I believe it, right? That's, this one's going to focus on belief in some ways more than just truth as in, I think, coherentism, again, trying to wrap my brain around it in myself, but coherentism is, is for the first one that talks about the fact that truth kind of comes from within. And that I'm making a statement of belief. And I'm, I don't believe belief and truth are, are correspondent. And they don't necessarily, they're not the same thing. I can believe something's not true and not believe something that is true. In fact, let me give you the example that helped me understand that part of it. So if someone's and I think this is, in my opinion, is open and shut for the fact that the things aren't connected. So let's go back to the correspondence theory. If it, what if, what if Coulson says, Hey, tomorrow, it's going to snow. Okay. Is that a true statement? And he believes it? Is it a true statement or a false statement? It's true subjectively that he believes it, but we don't know yet. Right. Okay. So here's the thing they pointed out. If it, if it snows tomorrow, that's what makes that a true statement or a false statement. If I say it's going to snow tomorrow, whether I believe it's going to snow tomorrow has no bearing on whether or not it's going to snow tomorrow. If it snows tomorrow, that doesn't mean I knew it was going to snow tomorrow. It just means I believed it was going to snow tomorrow. You see the difference? Yeah. So I believed it wasn't knowledge. I didn't know it as some kind of truth that I know it was a belief that I had that turned out to be true or could have just as easily turned out to be false. This is one of the debates we watched that I really appreciated was, was two guys arguing about, okay, would that be considered knowledge? No, would it be considered truth? Well, in the correspondence theory? Yes. Yeah. He accurately described reality. So what he said yesterday was truth, whether or not he knew it. And I like that because it points out how true is not, something is true is not dependent on my knowledge or belief or anything like that. I think they're, I now think they're totally independent truth and knowledge. And the goal is to, is to believe what is true. Like that's our, that becomes our goal. And I think everybody agrees with that. This is saying coherentism says when I say something is true, all I mean is it fits within my worldview. It works in my worldview. I have to be careful with works because that's a different one. I don't think that's a good definition of truth though. It's rational within my perspective. I don't think that's, I think that, that, that convolutes truth and belief. Yeah. Well, just because it can just immediately become what I want it to mean or, or so subjective. Could you like come at it from the whole idea that you were talking about last week about, or the week before last about believing that a donkey could speak? That whole, that like that idea of worldview being like, well, it's not a rational thing if I don't believe that somebody is capable of making a donkey speak. And so, yes, because like then you're, I guess, looking at it from the worldview side of it again, it's coherent within my belief system that a donkey could speak. I just, or is it still way off? So on Friday, this might be totally off. So on Friday, we went, we were down in San Antonio and we're walking around the Alamo and there's two rides and things like that. But I was thinking, I don't know why this came into my head. What if a guy was walking around saying, I fought in the Alamo, like I was at the battle, like I survived. Come talk to me. Like, how would I go about, I again have no idea how this entered my mind. Maybe I was picturing someone like dressing up and pretending. Yeah, right. Sure. But if he was really saying, no, no, really, no, really, I really was there. Yeah. Like, how would I disprove him or how would I talk to him or what would I ask of him to prove to me that you actually were there? Like, what would convince me? You know, maybe he really, you know what I'm saying? Like, there's so many factors. Like, how could you be still alive? How come this is the first time I've ever heard of you? Like, tell me what Davey Crockett had for breakfast the day he died? Like, I don't know what I would ask, but it was just, it was interesting that it was, I was thinking it would be a truth claim. Right. That anybody could make. But then, there would be a certain set of, if I, if I wanted to actually talk with him and not just dismiss him as crazy, right? There is a certain set of questions I would want him to answer to convince me or that I would try to use to disprove him if I already, if I believe that. So I don't know if that's related to that, but this could be a crazy guy who really, really, really, really believed it and knew a whole lot of history. Right. And identified and maybe named himself as someone who you could say, yeah, that person was actually there. And we just thought he died, but actually, you know, yeah. Do you remember how there was a Billy the kid thing with that? Really? Do you remember watching Young Guns? Oh yeah. And allegedly there was a guy for years and years who claimed he was Billy the kid. Yeah. And, and then he finally died. And there were, to this day, there's arguments of whether or not he was Billy the kid. Like, no one could prove it or disprove it. There's no way for them to, I mean, you'd think nowadays, maybe there'd be some DNA evidence, but okay, here's what strikes me. As I was listening to this one explained, part of why I struggled is because I think they're coming at it. So if I read this technical definition, a theory of truth, true sentences are those that cohere with a specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true if and only if it is coherent with all of, or most of their other beliefs. And again, they're saying when we use the word truth, what does it mean? And this is, this is one of them is this is what it means to just when I say something is true is I mean, it fits within my worldview. And I can see that people would use it that way. I just don't think that's what truth is. I think that's belief. Right. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay. And I think it sounds like we're splitting hairs, but I think it's a big distinction that I just, again, feel like one is clearly outside of me that we can both walk outside together. And one is more like, well, this is just what I believed. And I can't, I feel like you couldn't get anywhere. Right. Well, it seemed, it seems like that's your truth. Right. Right. If it, if it fits within your belief system, right? That is what we've been talking about as far as as a psychologist, I totally can understand that as the psychological definition of truth, but like, I just think is belief. Right. So you could have a largely coherent set of beliefs that are false. Yeah. And I think if I say that, that means I don't buy the coherence theory. I think coherence is important. I think my belief is that it's not a way to say that beliefs should cohere. And if they don't, that may reveal a falsehood in my beliefs. Right. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So I think rationality and coherency is a valuable tool, but here's what's wild. Here's what struck me by the way, as we keep going through this. When other people use the word truth, they don't mean what I mean. Like not even close. Right. And at a fundamental level, they apparently don't mean what I mean. So here's the third one. The third one is the one that scares me probably the most out of all of them. That's pragmatism. Now I knew about pragmatism as a philosophy. I didn't understand, I guess I did not realize that pragmatism was considered under the heading of truth. And what is meant by truth is something that works. If it works, then it's true. And that was one of the definitions. That's what pragmatism is. It's true if it is effective, if it is useful. And that's how you would evaluate truth, is whether or not that it worked, whether or not it fit, whether or not it happened the way it's supposed to happen. And that again struck me as, I mean, I always think pragmatism is wildly dangerous, but okay. Curious on your thoughts. Well, you said it happened as it's supposed to happen already. That sounds like there's a purpose behind it, which I know that's interesting. It does what I wanted it to do. Right. I just feel like, again, you're going to end up with power of who gets to decide what works for them. Cause you can argue a lot of, you know, dictators, it was working for them, right? Or molesters or I don't know, just selfish people. Maybe it works for you, but it doesn't mean that it's right. And now we get another word. There's a real right or real wrong. Yeah. But yeah, that's an interesting thing that it is like a theory of truth. Yeah. If it works, then it is true. That true beliefs are accepted at the end of an inquiry. Say that again. True beliefs. They are accepted. We decide something is true when we see whether or not it works. And what struck me about this one is, is it struck me as fascinating from our perspective. When we're talking about deconstructing your faith or reconstructing it is this seems like it could be a dangerous path of reconstruction that you say, man, my, my faith has failed me. I don't think it's true. This difficult question has called me to walk away from God, but man, I really miss the community. So I'm going to, I'm going to keep holding onto this because I think it's psychologically healthy for me or it makes me happier to be this. The statistics say I'll live longer. Yeah, exactly. Much, much less like, you know, that there were, and one of the things I've told, said we need to talk about at some point is a, is religious capital is community capital. And so we can actually take a second and discuss that. I don't know if you have heard this idea, but it's the idea that people tend to believe it's, this is a pragmatic argument. People tend to believe what gives them the most capital within a community. And so whether or not you put a fish on the back of your car probably has a lot to do with where you live. Yeah. Whether you name your company, Christian something or, or do you have an Icluse on your sign or you, whatever. And the argument is that that has nothing to do with someone's beliefs beyond the fact that, well, in this community, being a Christian is worth a certain amount of capital. And it gains me something to be a Christian or gains me something to confess Christianity. And that's, it's weird in Tyler, you know, every, every place you face a different thing in Tyler, Texas, where we are, the main risks are the main problems we face in regards to our faith and Christianity probably is not atheism or naturalism or agnosticism, at least not right around here. It is cultural Christianity or even worse, congregational Christianity. Like I'm a Christian because I live in Tyler and my name and I'm named after a disciple or I'm a Christian because my, my uncle paid for the fellowship hall at the church. Like that, that type of reasoning and it's, it's rampant here. And I think that's a pragmatic version of Christianity. It works. And probably what's happening then too, for a lot of deconstructing people is it's getting more and more costly. Exactly. And so that, that reason for sticking with it is diminishing or in the same way, a lot of people don't go to church anymore because they get burned by people in the church. Right. And that's why, I mean, there are so many passages about how to get along. Like there's so much time where Paul is trying to explain, bear with one another, forgive, rebuke, you know, like all that stuff, because to me, the pragmatic thing is, well, I'll be in your community as long as you make me feel good or don't confront me or don't call me out or don't do anything I don't like, which is the way people feel about a lot of friendships and marriage. But that makes sense. Yeah. If it doesn't cost, if it's not costing me anything, if it works, like I'm getting the friends that I want, my job is not in jeopardy. Right. It works. Especially if it works in my favor. Exactly. Then it's great. And I think, I mean, in all of this, coming from my Christian worldview, I would say the underlying wrong assumption with probably most of these is going to be, we're all naturally good and we want good things for the community and for other people and we're willing to sacrifice for it. And I just think that the Bible teaches that we're pretty selfish and just want to do what we want to do. And if it works to get along and be nice to you because of the payoff for me, then I'll do it. But I'm not doing it for the right reasons. I'm doing it. And again, I just think that it's the idea of communism that like it sounds great. Like we all are sharing. We're all we'd all love to. And it's like, you don't know people. Like, do you, that's the only you I say, have you met you? Like, yeah, that you just, that's the number one flaw right away with communism. You just go, yeah, we're going to voluntarily all give up for the good of everybody. Exactly. Yes. So that's part of the problem with pragmatism, I guess. Yes. I think so. That's what strikes me is I think there is something intriguing about pragmatism as a as an ugly explanation for things, but but not as a standard for truth. Yeah. Certainly not. And this is part of what they're connected to not moral truth. It's not true just because it's not morally right. Right. Just because it works. But I think when people so part of this, there's a jadedness in here that as I listened to different people and experts, alleged experts talk about this, they often would talk in terms of this is what people mean when they say it. And I'm like, well, that's sure that's fine. I get that people mean that when they say it, but is that therefore make it what it is? And I'm I still came back to the correspondence theory of but is it connected to reality? I mean, is it is it right? We need a word that means that that word is truth and continues to be truth. And you've not talked to me off the fact that some people mean other things than that. When they say truth, I just think that means they're wrong when they're defining it anyway. Okay. This one was the most fun for me. I'm curious to hear what you guys think about that. And this is called the deflation deflationism. And that is that the word truth doesn't mean anything. The word itself. Now, this is that isn't that there isn't such a thing as truth. It's just that truth is a nonsensical concept. The whole argument was this to assert whatever and to say that thing is true is to say the same thing. So if I say it's snowing outside, or if I say it's true that it's snowing outside, that's the same thing. And so all we mean when we say truth is it's like a, it's like a verbal term that we use. It's just a term that doesn't actually mean anything in and of itself. We're just, we're just describing what we think, what we think is accurate. And so we're saying it and it doesn't actually mean anything. And then anytime you could say, is this man guilty or innocent? For example, if I say, Oh, the truth is he's innocent. I could also just say he's innocent. And I would mean exactly the same thing. Therefore, the word truth doesn't actually mean anything. It's just a placeholder word. So give me your thoughts on that one. So why is it called deflation? I think it's because it has to do with deflating the significance of the word, recognizing it's a non, it's a, it's a non-meaning word. It's a placeholder word. It doesn't mean anything. But if you were to ask them, like they wouldn't give a definition of truth in general. They wouldn't give a blanket, like a vague anything. If you were to say, so what is truth? There we go. Yeah, it doesn't, the word truth itself, the concept of truth doesn't mean anything. It's just a verbal, a man. Yeah, exactly. It's something like that. It's, it's, it's using the word like over and over again. It's a, it's, it's just a, it's a placeholder word to say, to say something is true or just to say the thing is to say the same thing. And so truth, their argument is truth doesn't, the concept of truth, the word truth doesn't mean anything. It's just the way we talk. It sounded to me like a nominalist argument, meaning truth only has significance in name only. Anyway, so here's the problem. You ready for the answer to this one? There was really one guy who we, who, who my son and I, as we were looking at this, we kind of love this guy because he was, when we looked him up, I'll, I'll share his name another time when, after I know him better, but it's, he then said the problem with deflationism, the main problem with deflationism is then why do we care so much about truth? Like we're literally in the process of describing an entire scientific and philosophical realm of a heading that apparently means nothing and has no meaning. Right. Like that doesn't, that doesn't make any sense. If it has no meaning, why are we talking about it? And he really undermined the deflationist argument, even though he actually likes the deflationist argument in some ways for some understanding. And he also says, he says, so to statement, this guy's guilty or the truth, this guy is guilty are both the same thing. He agreed with that. And then he said, why should I care whether he's guilty? What difference does the concept of guilty and innocent make to me? Why is that a big deal to me? Truth has not lost its inflated place in our minds and hearts. And so it was, it was a really good, a really good, um, short podcast that was called the mystery of truth or the treasure of truth that I looked up and it talked about well, deflationism sounds great, but the problem is then why is it a treasure? Why do we care so much about it? Why do we work so hard to get it? You said the treasury of truth. I don't, I don't remember the exact language. It was like the treasure of truth was the idea. Um, so it was intriguing to, as they described some of these very quickly, then, then the fifth one, any other thoughts on that one on deflationism? I don't, to be honest, I'm just kind of sitting here with my mouth wide open. Like, uh, thankfully I'm taking some notes. Hopefully I can think about it. Exactly right. And this is, this is, I would encourage people to, but it was, again, I said this right before the podcast talking to these guys, but I really get the right word. Isn't my feelings hurt. I just get disappointed sometimes when I'm like, Oh, oh sweet. There's like six different perspectives on what truth is and these deep thinking philosophers. And I know sometimes that just means I don't understand it. And I'm more than happy for that. And then if I was able to sit down with one of the guys who has spouses, this, or one of the women who has spouses, they'd be willing to explain to me in such a way that I would go, Oh, okay. Well, now that I understand where you're coming from, but watching several things and reading several things, I just, I had a hard enough time even expressing them as we watched, as I struggled through the coherentism one. With one of course is neolism, which is nothing is true. In fact, a little bit of nothing is nothing is anything or everything is nothing. And this one is the phrase we only like the phrase that kept coming with is we only know things through our brains. And therefore truth is entirely an invention of the human brain. Relativism is a part of that, that argument. There may be truth, but we can't ever know what it is. That's relativism. Because I can only receive it through my, my senses through my brain. You said relativism is truth may be out there, but we can never really, we could never know what it was because it's relative to each of our perspectives. The man arguing for that one talked about how visual illusions, if I put an illusion on a piece of paper, I can look at it two different ways. And it looks very different. That's proof of how I can't know what is true because of that, because the paper doesn't change, but my, my recognition of the paper changes, which proves that we're relativists. Thoughts? I just think even that illustration, you, you use the words, it's an illusion. And so we were, we're agreeing on something like that we can see, like we can figure it out and we can talk about it. And so it actually has meaning like it's not just, right. If we were all like, I have no idea how that's, but if, I don't know, it just seems. Yeah. Amazingly, Chris. So the guy who I referenced a second ago, who is, who was so seemed, seemed brilliant in his responses again. Okay. I'll say his name now. I'm hesitant because I don't know what else this guy has done. We literally watched him in one. So we're not endorsing him right now. No, at this stage, not at all. It's a guy named Raven, Raymond Talis. I think it's T a LLIS. And he was in a debate and the guy brought up the illusion that first of all, the guy said, you know, we can only know, we can only know things through our brains and therefore, you know, truth has to be at best relative and maybe non-existent. And his first question was, I'm curious where you come up to the present with the statement. We can only know things through our brain. I was like, I'm curious how you know that to be true. How do you know that as a statement of truth that we can only know things through our brain, especially if you can only know things through your brain, how you could possibly come up with as a truth. He really undermined the nihilist argument because the nihilist argument is constantly undermining itself. That's one that we're all comfortable with. We've all, if you're in the apologetics world at all, you've heard, you know, there's, there's, there is no such thing as truth is a statement of truth. It is a self-refuting statement. That's not unfair critique critique. That is absolutely appropriate critique. Right. It's not, you're not being sneaky or being witty or whatever. I think the difference is most people, you either know, you either can recognize you're making a self-refuting statement or you just don't, but everybody makes truth claims. Right. They just, you might realize that you're making one or you might not. Like that's a claim. That nihilism is a claim about truth, the nature of truth. And they expect, and here's the thing too, is they expect me to see it their way. Right. Like that's, that's what they're arguing. That's why even just arguing about morals and relativism stuff anyways is silly because if there is no truth and there are no morals, then why are you talking? Why are you talking? But you're actually trying to convince me to see it your way, which implies there's something that you think I can see too. Right. It's not just true for you. It's also true for me. Right. Cause you're trying to convince me of it. Right. Yeah. The guy, the guy, when the guy said, he used the visual illusion concept. So I'm paying you the compliment of that's exactly what this brilliant guy said was he was like, okay, but you're calling it an illusion, which means you know, it's, it's an illusion that it's not expressing reality in some certain way. How do you know it's an illusion unless you know what is reality? Yeah. And so he summarized the, he quoted somebody else as a counterfeit coins imply a real coin. If you call it a counterfeit coin, you must be comparing it to something that's not a counterfeit coin or you wouldn't have the concept of counterfeit at all. So I think that is a significant, I'm very comfortable throwing out nihilism, but the idea, I was intrigued by the fact that nihilism at least partially came from the idea that we can only know things through our brains. That doesn't feel that doesn't feel all that nihilistic nihilistic to me. Like, it's like, cause you can, you can still know something. Like brain is there for, by the way, I don't know where my diplomas are, but wherever they are, I have a photo of my brain behind my Aggie diploma. Well, I can't see it. I know it. So I wanted proof. Well, cause I can't see it. It is not reality to me. That's exactly right. You can't see yours either, which means this, you're, you're straying away from what I said that we, we, we can know things. And I think, so here's what's interesting. Okay. So I got to go back. I think what's interesting about coherentism and the rational argument is I think that as we talked about a few weeks ago, that is a source of truth. Like when we talked about epistemology, rational thought, coherent thought is a source of truth or is a source of falsehood. Like we just said, if you hold an, a belief that is not coherent with your other beliefs, it means at least, at least one of them is not right. So if I say, and this is where people struggle. If I say God is benevolent and all loving, then somehow the idea that he is allowed suffering on this earth has to be coherent with my whole belief system. If I can't find a way to make those coherent, then I have a problem. One of those two things, either he doesn't allow suffering or he isn't benevolent is going to have to change unless I can show how they are coherent, that a loving person could let someone suffer. How is that coherent? And so I agree with coherentism as one of the tools for knowledge. Pragmatism I think falls really pragmatism and empirical evidence fall closely together. When I say I find evidence for it, I can do it over and over again. It functions, it works. This you'll be interested to know, especially Chris shared you mentioned, no, they kept filing evolutionary thought under pragmatism, meaning it answers the questions. It works. I was like, I feel like that's more rational than it is pragmatic. They're making a rational argument. This could lead to that, therefore it must be right. I don't know how much evolution works. It leads to the destruction of millions of species and could mean human beings could easily evolve into non-existence someday. All it takes is one competitor to compete us out and we're done. I don't know how well you can say that works in and of itself. And again, remember I'm the one who has no problem with evolutionary theory. But to say it works, I'm not sure I'd go with that. The only one that I thought was fascinating I'd wanted to study further was deflationism. That was more psychological. What do I mean when I use the word truth? Do I mean anything by that? Or is it like so many politicians who are like, I'll tell you the truth. You're about to lie to me. What's about to happen? Honestly, you may be honest. Honestly, if you were being honest, you probably wouldn't need to say honestly. But beyond that, I didn't find a lot of value except in their refutations. I did love the thought, you said snow, it will snow tomorrow. It will rain tomorrow conversation. And how significant that is to understanding that truth and knowledge are, they should be interdependent, maybe they're interdependent, but they're independent. And that proves it. The fact that I could buy a lottery ticket and believe I'm going to win, but that belief has no bearing on whether I'm going to win. If I do win, that makes my statement I'm going to win. True. If I don't win, that just means it was a belief. And my belief didn't change in either one of those. I believe that was going to happen. I was either right or wrong. Wrong means it wasn't true. Right means it was true. And in my mind, that absolutely jumps back to the correspondence theory. Truth is what corresponds to reality. Because anything in the future, I mean, you just don't know. And so it can always be, yeah. And I think too, that's the reasoning that God gives like in Isaiah with all the false gods where he talks about fulfill prophecy, where he goes, go ahead and call your gods out here and let them tell the future. And then we'll know. And then we'll be able to see that they're actually gods and where God actually makes that claim of himself. I make known the end from the beginning from ancient times, what is to come. So that's actually, he's inviting them to prove that their statement is true by, I guess it happening. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. So why, because I know that it's important for us to look at things like this, worldly definitions or worldly theories, why would you guys say it's important for us as Christians and for our listeners who are engaging with either working with the faith that they have or reconstructing their faith, dealing with these theories. Why is it important for us to think about this and to engage with these kind of theories? Oh, I don't. I just wanted to talk about it. No, no, no. I love it. I mean, totally kidding. No. That's what Chris already said, that you have to define what you mean. You can't assume that when I throw out this word, you mean the same thing. When I say Christianity is true, I mean it in the correspondence sense or someone can mean it in the pragmatic sense or true for you, doesn't mean it's true for me. And so again, that's where, I mean, it's not rude or helpful just to go, we're on the same page. What do you mean by true? Yes, because it's the same thing with faith that people think that sincerity and truth therefore go together and that doesn't mean your faith is... Right, you can be sincerely wrong. Exactly. Okay. And that's a big part of it for me too is I think you need to know the vocabulary and even for me, it's just been huge as I, when I research a topic like this to realize, I now realize I've been in conversations with people and you could, the two of us could not have deconstructed our using that word, our conversation down to the lowest common denominator until we shrink, shrink, shrink, shrink, shrink. And what we would have discovered was at the most basic fundamental connection to reality level, we weren't on the same page. And so we're debating some conversation that's 900 levels above where our disagreement is. And so how do you have a reasonable conversation about whether a statement is true or not with someone who thinks, for example, truth is dependent upon your belief system? Well, does it work within your belief system? That's very arrogant and disconnected to say, what I'm doing is sitting and judging you on where the coherence of your belief system. And I realized a conversation I'm having with a guy online on email back and forth. That's what this is. What we're having is I'm challenging him that his belief system is not coherent. And he's challenging me that my belief system isn't coherent. I don't think that's a waste of time. If I can poke holes in his boat and it starts sinking and he realizes, okay, this isn't coherent. I need something better. But he actually has said, I'm not trying to convince you that what I believe is true. I just don't want you to think I'm an idiot. And I'm like, okay, one, I don't think you're an idiot. And two, I am trying to convince you that what I'm saying is true. Like, I don't care if you think I'm an idiot. I'm not worried about that. I just want you to see that there is a standard of truth. There are things that are true. Again, every, every other one of these offers you no guidance. Truth offers you no guidance in the coherence theory. It's just, it's just circular thinking. Does this belief fit with what my belief already was, which fits with what my belief already was. And that's, that seems like super dangerous. And what everybody's doing, I mean, this is cognitive dissonance. I don't want to, no, no, this is, this is how I, this is where I go to church. So it must be true. This is, this is how I voted. So I must have been right. Or this is how my parents did. And so I must have, and, and that's, I think coherentism is actually keeps people from doing the healthy version of deconstruction. Well, and I think too, for all of us, our listening world included should ask themselves, do I think that is what I believe objectively true? Like what do I think? Do I think my beliefs are true just because I believe them? Have I ever thought about this? Like because that's what's going to happen is people are going to realize, oh my goodness. Yeah, that was just the way I was raised. Or I just, I thought Christianity is true because there's more of us doing the believing or yeah, or it's like I said before, the example of people saying that Christianity is true because I believe it's true. And that doesn't make something true though. It's just, it's just, it tells you something about you. That's, that's nice to know. But that doesn't all of a sudden mean that it's true. So I think that's important for everybody to ask. Do I think it's fair Chris that thinking about truth any other way is going to eventually fail you? Well, I think I was trying to think back. You'd mentioned mere Christianity. One of Lewis's first arguments is actually the moral argument for God's existence in that. But what he talks about is people reveal what they actually believe sometimes by the words they say, right? Like they would say there, there's no real right and wrong, but then they'll say things like that's not fair. I was here first. You shouldn't have said that. Right. So you listen to what they say. But I really think if you watch how most people live, even though it sounds good in philosophy, most people live with this reality based understanding of truth. Like it's cold outside. So I, I will put on a jacket or I will, you know, it's not an illusion that those cars on the other side of the road are going this way. I'm actually, I believe they are. I'm going to stay over on this side. Right. So I think that all of those, again, we can philosophize about them, but are they livable? Like would you actually live them out and how long would they actually work? And so that's part of what I guess that we're saying is Christianity is objectively true. Right. And it's consistent with reality and it does work. Right. Um, but I just think that a lot of people, because that's what he says in his book. He says the guy who says to you, um, he might break his promise to you, but as soon as you break your promise to him, he'll say, you know, that's not fair. Or you can say Jack Robinson, I think is the word he uses. Right. Um, but anyways, that's just again, where people reveal what they actually believe in their, in their response to being wronged or just in how they live their life. Like a someone who would say that all, you know, this is all just a, an illusion, probably still wear their seat belts or brush to their teeth. Right. Because they believe there really are consequences externally to what they think. Like they, they, they go, try to walk through doors, not walls. You know what I mean? So again, I just think it sounds good to have all these conversations, but when it comes down to it, if you start giving practical examples of how you live, what's, I think most people actually just have that assumption. I actually think after, after digging through these and even this conversation has helped me wrap my brain around a little bit, is that while all these have turned out to be are at best ways of evaluating truth, but they're not truth. It's not whether or not it works, whether or not it's empirically repeatable is a way of evaluating truth, but it's not the only way to know truth or evaluate it. Same thing through with something is coherent or rational. Should my beliefs be coherent and rational? Yes. I think that's very, very, very important. Does that prove that they are true? No. I think, I think probably most schizophrenics have a rationally coherent, at least in their own mind, it makes sense in their head. That doesn't make it true. And it would be, even when we would guess at it, it's either true or false. I'm not saying we can always know what is true or false. Like I'm thinking about the whole, you know, we're, we're actually just digital creations in a, in a sim simulations from sometime in our own future. Like is, is there a coherence to that way of thinking? I think there is, it's either true or it's false. And then we can evaluate it based on whether or not it corresponds to reality. And that's what we're trying to do. So, so people who are listening to this understand when we're talking about reconstructing faith, we are encouraging you to build a faith based on truth and reality, not based on your community, not based on, although they may be right. Your community may be dead on and leaving your community can be incredibly foolish or it can be the right decision. And we couldn't ever make that call from a podcast. But I think, I think recognizing this is what we're talking about and it is, it's okay to evaluate things based on is, is, does it correspond to reality? And so that's a, anyway, I just, I feel like so much in my heart of when I hear people talk about deconstructing their faith, they're tearing something down that was not worth keeping and they're not replacing it with anything. And they're just, they're just now stuck with nothing or with something that's so pathetic that it doesn't create a worthwhile life. And our art hope for you, I hope for those of you who are listening is, especially if you're in that position of deconstructing your faith, that you'll do that in an intentional and guided way, not just as a reaction. And then that gives you tools. So I, when I think of deconstruct, I know we talked about the underwear drawer model, which I think works well, but also the idea of, of if you're deconstructing something, it's like if my kids are deconstructing the building, they're made out of Legos. You don't throw away the Legos. I mean, you just, some of the Legos are really good. You need to use those when you rebuild something different, something that's founded on truth. When you discover something that you grew up with wasn't founded on objective reality, then you probably do need to dismantle that, but don't leave it dismantled. I think that's a big part of what we're passionate about for this. And I think the hard thing too is it's, it takes some effort. It takes some mental sweat. Like you have to realize what's at stake or that this is a serious issue. Cause a lot of people early on in our conversation might've already tuned this out going like, oh, we're just talking about truth. Like we're defining that's so up there, but it's like, no, this is really foundational. Like you need to be able to think this through and not just have it spoon fed to you. And I do think too, what you said about being disappointed with a lot of naturalists or skeptics or whatever, as I think a lot of those people just haven't been grounded in logical thinking or haven't gone very deep either. But then they haven't been challenged enough by believers saying like, let's, let's unpack that a little bit. Or they're not, we're going to talk about in our next, I don't know if it'll be our next as in next time you listen, but another, another time is we're going to talk about the idea of, of kind of the psychological effect of the weariness that people can feel on any side of an argument or, or the desire to protect themselves, the cognitive dissonance, the need to protect themselves. So I will unpack that as well. Cause I think a lot of, a lot of Christians and non-Christians are facing some of that stuff right now. A lot of believers and unbelievers are facing a sense of man would, like you said, maybe they're giving up on a podcast like this. Cause it's just, it's just hard. It just seems hard. I don't want to think about all this stuff. But I want to watch another 45 second cat video instead. So now there's anything wrong with that. But anyway, yeah, this, this conversation is hard and it's deep. I know we know it is. That's why we want to encourage you with it. Stay encouraged.
