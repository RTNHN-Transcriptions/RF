We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. Guys, it's good to be back. And we are going to handle a few listener questions and comments that we've gotten over the past couple of weeks. But before we do that, we're going to discuss a couple more of our quote unquote Christian overreactions, or things that Christians have overreacted about in the past that we feel are just valuable to talk about. The one that we're going to start off with right now. So I floated this to some of my friends of like, you know, after we talked about it, you know, Xmas, Halloween, stuff like that, what were things that they were aware of that they would kind of classify as things that Christians have overreacted about. One of my friends said the satanic panic. And so I didn't really understand what that was. And so we had to have a broader conversation about that. Chris, can you unpack what the satanic panic was? Yeah, yeah. Before back in 1980, before you guys were born, I, yeah, this was, this was a real thing. So here's what's intriguing. But when I referenced in the last podcast that, that there was, like, I had to miss Halloween's that was because of this, what's kind of colloquially called the satanic panic, which was, and I mean, we, in our neighborhood, we actually, there was a road, a dirt road that connected about a four mile dirt road that connected our neighborhood to another, to kind of the town. It was called Hatchet Man Road. That wasn't actually its name, but it was called Hatchet Man Road because everyone knew there was a crazed Satanist Hatchet man who lived out in the woods on that road. And he would periodically just drag kids off into the woods and, you know, hatchet them. And, uh, I mean, all the time, I mean, we all knew kids who had gone, no, no, it, as far as I know it, no, there was no such thing. And so, but that was propagated by the parents. Uh, I don't know. I don't think intentionally. Um, and so I remember as a young man, us choosing to go walk down this road, my best friend and I in this like huge dare to ourselves in the middle of the night. And we walked all the way down it. And at the end of it was a church that we all knew was a satanic church and as a little tiny white church that was a satanic church. And, and so my friend and I, um, in the middle of the night with our little flashlights went up to the door of it, um, daring ourselves. I had to be a 12. He was probably 14, 13, 14 test of your manhood. Absolutely. And everything else. And so we slowly, we went up and started trying to turn the door and it opened, which we did not think would happen. And so that created a whole new level of like, well, now we have to go in like, what are we going to find? And all I remember so well was shining the flashlight on the floor and it being red, like blood red, the floor was, and we were just like, oh my gosh. And we opened it up and it turns out it was just a little African American church. They had little, little, um, you know, little waivers that are meant to have little fans that they had that had like Dr. King's head on them and stuff like that. And so it was, I'm not his actual head, just a picture. That would be more of the satanic line. It was a, uh, and it was this huge letdown where I was like, Oh, it's just, it's just a church. That was also like a whole different conversation than it's like just an African American church. Oh yeah. But that it had been assigned as a satanic church. The kids had that sign that it was right by a, and again, I know there's a huge shock to have a church right by a graveyard, but it was right by a graveyard, which of course also fed into the, anyway, we were kids. Um, I am sure no adults believed any of this or thought any of this was true, but as kids, it had all passed around among kids. And this was, that is, that story repeated itself in little towns all over America, um, during the satanic panic, um, in big towns, there were allegedly big covens of satanic worshipers who were capturing, you know, poke picking in animals off the street and sacrificing them. And more importantly, grabbing kids and sacrificing them. And what's wild is I don't know if that, I mean, movies, that was a theme in movies in the eighties. If you go back and watch eighties movies, the bad guy very often is some kind of Satanist who is ritually torturing and killing people to worship Satan. And like, that was a super common theme all the way around. The possession movies were huge during that time. Um, and some of that kind of stuff has never gone away and it's been around, but yeah, it was, it was a big deal. The satanic cult worship. Uh, that was the era we mentioned Dungeons and Dragons in the last episode. Like that was Dungeons and Dragons was just, uh, the, you know, it was the gateway drug for Satanism. Right. And well, and I think so much so, uh, you know, talking about that the first time I was introduced to the, even just the concept of Dungeons and Dragons was on a focus on the family kids show. Um, and it was like painting it in a very negative light in that kind of satanic. We don't do that as Christians. Uh, it was an adventures and Odyssey, which I love. I love those radio programs, but it was, but I just remember that was kind of a series that stuck out of like, I don't know, Brian, I don't know if you would say anything more to that. Yeah. I think it's because, I mean, there was like some side issues, like it's addictive and things like that, but also saying that it is at its core tied to the occult, which is kind of like a lot of these other things that we've talked about. Um, I don't know, you know, I don't know to what degree, like if there's any level of truth to that or not in its origin. I mean, I've, but I was around at the time. I mean, I, I, you know, I played version one of Dungeons and Dragons and, um, what they had was it's very, it's very mythologically based and part of the quote mythology of Dungeons and Dragons, what included like the mythology of demons. And so there were demons as monsters in the monster manuals that you could fight or that would be, you could be sent to the planes of hell and have to fight demons. And, um, and then there were also positive. I mean, there was a lot of religious stuff, but it was all paganistic mythological type stuff. Like your, your character could be a follower of Thor. I mean, yeah, Thor or of, uh, you know, or Zeus or, or whatever. But it, but it doesn't, but was it ever this, like, now it's going to be something more than a game? Not intentionally. I am. I have no doubt. It's kind of like, we talked about like Ouija boards and things like that, which were another big hit during this time period that, that was like, can they be perverted into something actually evil? Of course they can. And some things are really easy to pervert into something actually evil. Um, and, but, but, and, and, but anything can be, I mean, Satan quotes the Psalms when he's tempting Jesus, even the Psalms can be perverted to evil, but, and so you can pervert anything to evil. And I mean that word literally the word means twist to twist something from being what it was intended to be. Um, but no, having read every, every manual that came out with the first version, there's never anything to encourage actual spell casting. It's about as much like Satanism or pay even paganism as Harry Potter is like witchcraft. Um, and so it didn't carry any of that in a normal part. And, and we as a, now it was certainly, there were moments that like comic books from that era, um, there was some salacious aspects to it. Um, there were, you know, a few monsters in the monster manual that like their mythological counterpart, um, say like mermaids or something were not clothed. And so that certainly has an effect on a young teenage boy who's, you know, playing a game or whatever. And so again, it was not hard to pervert and make bad or even evil. Um, but it wasn't necessary. Yeah. So it's like anytime there's creativity, it can be used really well or for, you know, sinful. Exactly. And so we, um, as a kid playing it, it never crossed over into anything other than just imagination play for us. Like it was never anything inappropriate or anything weird or anything like that. It was just a fun game to play. And we actually just ignored the demon parts. And it was, especially as a, I was the most, I don't know if the word is rigidly Christian of my friends at that time. Um, but I certainly, uh, like I remember that there was only a couple of us who could have the books. Um, the other friends couldn't that like, if they bought a Dungeons and Dragons book, we had to store it at our houses. Um, so their parents didn't catch them with it. Um, but that same era, um, there was go tons and tons of movies that connected to it. Um, rock and roll music was con was strongly connected to the satanic panic. Um, and some of that, you know, I don't, to this day, I don't know how you would know how much of the Ozzy Osborns out there were they actually in some way satanic or was this just a gimmick to, in order to fleece a lot of dumb teenagers out of a lot of millions and millions of dollars. Like it comes, I kind of feels like a zeitgeist thing. Like, Hey, I'm playing into the times. It is a cash cow in a way. Yes. And it's had, and how do you know? I mean, how do you know which of those rock and rollers really believed in that stuff and how many of them was just, you know, by putting six, six, six on their album covers and portraying a demon there. Totally. They could sell more albums. That's interesting. I didn't even think, is this also when you had like the people freaking out about run, like running a record backwards and it's just about to talk about back masking. Exactly right. Yes. Um, and back masking was part of that. The idea that you could run a record backwards. And what's wild is there really was such a thing as back masking, but, but there's never been much proof that it was one that it was ever done. Like there is anything other than a gimmick. Like allegedly the Beatles did it a few times. Well, you know, we know for sure the Beatles did it in one song because they liked the way a certain line of their sounded when run backwards. So they ran it backwards and put it in their song. Right. And you can actually hear it. Like it's not secret. Right. The question was, could you say like subliminal messages became a huge deal and there was a big study that came out during this time that if they super fast flashed the word, like you're thirsty or go get a coke on the screens in the movies, which again, I have no idea if this ever happened. The, the, I had a professor in a psychology professor who taught about these things and he was like, it's called subliminal for a reason. It means it's below your body's ability to take in the message. So there's really no evidence. So if you're taking in the message, yeah. So, and here's what's funny, according to him, and I've never verified this, they ran a big study during a very famous movie during that time and discovered that if, again, this may all not have actually happened. But allegedly it did that they ran a big study where they flashed like you're thirsty, go get a drink, all these different things during a movie. And that movie ended up having a much higher percentage of people going and getting drinks than other movies released at the same time. My professor pointed out that the movie was the Lord was Lawrence of Arabia, which is set exclusively in a desert and is like three and a half, four hours long. And it's like, well, yeah, of course, more people got to be other subliminal messages here that may be played into it. Well, again, it's just, it's so hard to know what if this was real as in intentional, even if it had no effect. I mean, hypnosis is another one that came out during that time, you know, spirit guardian type of thing. A lot of new age movement was going on then, which again, maybe a con 85, 90% of the time, people who are allegedly speaking through their past selves and maybe mostly a con, or there may be times when it is authentically evil and demonic. And how do we know when, unless we're going to dive in and investigate it. Can I ask a quick question? I know I'm, I'm kind of getting off from a psychological perspective. Can you unpack what hypnosis is? And is it like, can, is it legitimate or what you mean by legitimate? I mean, like for, I mean, I've, I feel like there's a bit, a lot of funny videos have come out of guy who comes in front of a football team and he makes them do stuff and then they don't remember or whatever. Is that what, what is that? I don't even know. So all, all hypnosis is, is an increased you're using a lot of different techniques to make someone more suggestible. That's really all you're doing. And so the human brain has different kinds of settings, drive, reverse, neutral, so to speak. I'm making those up, but that's the kind of thing. And what you're doing is you're doing your best to help someone who is willing to know when allegedly, as I understand it, no one can be actually hypnotized against their will. That happens in movies and stuff all the time, but, but there's no good research that someone who's not willing. And so you'll notice very often, you know, the, the performance hypnotist, they go into first, it's usually a bar and, and they go into the bar and they select people from the crowd to come up on stage. And the, and the most important, as I understand it, the most important, that same professor was a hypnotist is, is that they would, who they picked. And so like his, his goal in life was to get picked to be up on stage one day by another hypnotist. And he's like, I've been to hundreds of hypnotism shows and they all, none of them ever pick me. Like they can tell, Nope, don't let him on stage. Like they can tell. And he goes, I can tell the ones who I need to not bring up on stage too when I do it. And so, and so, you know, you want someone who's, you know, pretty, pretty inebriated, but not so drunk that they're falling down. Like he had this whole list of things. Funny, funny, funny. Well, so with our class, he actually said, I'm not going to hypnotize the whole class and I'm going to warn you in advance. I'm going to do it. And he's like, so I'm going to hypnotize the whole class and all of you will, will respond to the hypnosis that I'm about to put you guys through. So, and so then he, he, he starts talking this kind of monotone voice and it's only like two or three, I don't know, maybe 20 or 30 seconds. He's like, all right. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to put you in a position where you are more suggestible than you would normally be. And then, and so I'm going to encourage all of you to lay your head on your desks while we do this exercise. And we all did. And the minute we all laid our heads on the desk, it was like, okay, everybody back. Why did you lay your head on the desk? And we're all like, uh, you, you, you said two. He goes, no, I actually just said you could if you wanted to. But I, he goes, I just, the whole situation, me being a teacher as being in the room, everything feeds itself towards you being suggestible. And when I just said, Hey, you might want to put your heads down. All of you then did. And I was like, dad, gimmit, I wasn't going to fall for it. And so it's just, it's nothing more than, so there's, you can't do anything under hypnosis that you could not do, not under hypnosis. Um, they put people under hypnosis and do brainwave things and nothing actually, meaningfully changes under hypnosis, but you are suggestible and able and willing to do things you could not do probably without somebody suggesting that you could do it when you're highly suggestible. And so, you know, allegedly there are people who have done surgery and things like that. I feel like people have portrayed it as like, basically you're roofied, like basically you're, you're mentally like have no, you just have to do whatever someone says to you. And so there are people who are really good at this. If you let them can put you in a place where your ability to resist actions or your natural tendencies to resist actions is greatly debilitated. Um, you know, and you can do physical feats that you didn't, you would not think you could do and therefore you can't do, but a suggestible, then you're able to do it otherwise. And so including like seeming to forget things or remember things or whatever. And that's, I think he's right. That's all it really is is high, high, high levels of suggestibility. And some people are trained to do that well. And some people are, are more and are much more suggestible than other people and they can spot those people and the more suggestible you are the better it works. So now it was it linked with that because it's like a type of possession. Yes. And some people, and the idea was, and I would agree with this, allowing yourself to be highly suggestible to other humans is not a good idea. Um, and so I think we're dealing with that right now with the whole psychedelic movement, that's hitting America right now when it comes to therapeutic psychedelic usage is one of the things that psychedelics do is they do change your brainwaves and your brain patterns and they make you highly, highly suggestible. And so yeah, is that if, if the person who's with you is a hundred percent trustworthy and they suggest that you no longer have a certain childhood trauma or you no longer feel the feelings from a childhood trauma, might that help you? I mean, make sense to me that it might. Um, but you are, you are really putting yourself in somebody else's hands. And so very often they will also suggest that this is a highly religious experience because that also causes things to kind of lock in. And the next thing you know, you, you come away from that experience thinking you had this incredibly, incredible religious experience with Brazilian tree gods. And, and you believe that and your brain buys it because you were told that at a time of very high suggestibility. And so I, I think it's very, very risky. There may be a parole for it in the future, but I think it's risky at this stage. That's interesting. I was listening to a podcast of a guy who he's a pretty prominent evangelical. Now I can't remember his name off the top of my head. Y'all may know, but he basically came to faith through psychedelics and it's like pretty controversial, but he was like, not a believer was doing drugs. And that's like how the Lord reached out to him. But his point was like, no, like if you are a believer, like when you basically, when you like let down all the walls, anything can get in. And you, in that moment, you have no way of knowing whether or not it's true, whether or not it's false. And like there is a spiritual realm and he's like that it's basically like all walls down to everything. Um, especially, you know, obviously if you're not a believer and so he's like, it's not that God can't work in that, but like, it's also just not wise to just like have no, yeah, like basically what you're saying, although like mentally all walls down to anything. Yeah. And I, I think that is always what is risky, especially if you do believe in, as we do in invisible forces and they just see the idea of turning your brain off is unwise, you know, turning off filters. And so I don't want anyone to hear there was a huge overreaction, the satanic panic, thousands upon thousands of claims around the country of, of things like there's a satanic church and a hatchet man living on the road behind our house that turned out to be unsubstantiated. One website had said 12,000 unsubstantiated claims of satanic action in the United States during that time. Um, and I mean, extreme satanic actions. And so now there are satanists out there. The vast majority of them are actually not, they don't believe in an actual satan. They're of the movement in satanism that is just, it's essentially just paganism. And they choose to be able to do whatever you want to do. That's the huge majority of people who call themselves satanists. They recognize, they recognize satan as an example to them of someone who bucks the system. Um, there are a handful, and I don't know how many, and I know one else does either of people who are actually worshipers of the entity satan. And I assume they do all kinds of bad behaviors. If they can get away with it. Um, I don't know what all those would be. I don't know what satan would consider worship of himself, but I assume it's going to be however horrible it can be against the principles that God would want us to serve. So anyway, it isn't the satanism, isn't a real thing. It is. Um, but during that time period, every, you know, there was a satanist on every corner. There was a satanic church in every, a secret satanic church in every neighborhood kind of thing. And, and that was, it was a, it was a weird time to be trying to deal with things in a healthy way. That's interesting. Yep. So I think this is really helpful to talk about. And even now I've like with the rise of tick talk and different things, there's a new interest in the occult that's kind of come up for Gen Z for whatever reason. And there's even like witch talk and stuff. And some of it's like the aesthetics of like, you know, young people love paranormal movies. And there's always been that aspect of like, you know, just the unknown and the spooky and the scary, or even like on social media and aesthetic, just for the sake of like, I just like this aesthetic, you know, like I know people like that who are like, I just love, you know, Halloween and all the things. And it's just like the vibe is what I love. But, but I think there's also an interest in the occult that's like rising again, at least that's what I've heard, um, for younger generations. So I think it's interesting to talk about what does it look like to, yeah, like fully believe that the spiritual realm is real and, um, and not to diminish that in a way that's, you know, unbiblical, but also not take it to the point where, you know, cause then there are all those books that were written by Christians that were fiction, but were basically like, everything is demonic activity. Um, so like, how do you navigate those clear and present? Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, what would you say? How do you navigate where it's not an overreaction or even giving Satan credit for more than he deserves? That's right. You know, that's right. That's the devil made me do it type of talk. Right. Okay. But also not diminishing. There is like a spiritual war going on. Yeah. Because I don't think a lot of Christians have a good, um, integration of those two things. No, I agree. Let me, um, read, um, from a book I quoted in the sermon yesterday and the introduction or the preface of screwtape letters. CS Lewis says this, there are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves, the devils are equally pleased by both errors and will hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight. And so I think, I think like we just have to remember that though there is this spiritual world, we serve the God who is the God of that spiritual world. And we don't want to be ignorant of the fact that there is an invisible enemy out there, but we also don't want to give him credit, for something that he isn't. He is a limited being. He's not like God. He's, he's more like us and that he's a created being. He's limited by time and space. He can only be one place at a time, no matter how fast he might be. Um, he can't read thoughts. He's not like, he's wrong. We see him be wrong several times. So he's not omnipotent. He's not omniscient. He's not omnipresent. He's not any of those things. And as powerful as he may be, he is in a totally different category than God. Um, and also makes mistakes. He got prideful enough to prop his feet up on God's desk and that didn't go well for him. And so I think there is a, um, you know, he promises God, Oh, I'll make a bet with you that I can bring Job down and he fails. And so we, we know that he is a greatly limited being and there's a, we're not supposed to fear him because, um, the one that is in us is greater than the one that is in the world. So we have a healthy respect. We don't go toe to toe with him on our own, but at the same time, we don't have to fear him. So, and that overreaction I think is my main concern, as we said, as I said before, my, my main concern of the overreaction is it makes us, it makes us as Christians much easier to dismiss, to not have to hear our input. It was, I've used this example before, but I had some concerns about the morality of the Harry Potter series, um, especially as a psychologist who was, uh, I was very concerned about it. And so, but what I was concerned about was the fact that Harry and his best friends, the heroes of the story lie and cheat and steal all the time. And the good guys are the leadership, the teachers and professors and headmasters who cover for them. And the bad guys are the ones who think they should be punished for doing, for lying, cheating and stealing and breaking the rules. That was my concern about the book is ours is what is this going to communicate to a generation that the ends justify the means. And as long as you, you know, we, we actually talk about it with our kids when they go through it. And I'm like, okay, so what actually happens to Ron and Hermione and Harry when they go into the bathroom with the troll and all of my kids are able to go like, well, they would be dead. It's like, right. There's a reason the teacher sent them to their rooms and not to go hunt down the troll because they would have all been killed in reality. If, if Harry Potter was a reality and even the Harry Potter world was a reality, the troll would have killed all three of them in that bathroom. And they would have, the teacher still would have had to take down the troll. It would not have been these three children who did it. And so even within that perspective, they are foolish in their decision-making and somehow they always end up being rewarded for it. Gryffindor gets points because they broke the rules, disobeyed the teachers, risked their lives and nearly died doing it. And somehow Gryffindor gets points for that. And that's, I'm like, I'm troubled by this, but the problem is no one would let me talk about my concerns about Harry Potter the minute they found out I was a Christian because they knew that my problem with Harry Potter was, Oh yeah, you just don't like the fact that there's creativity in witchcraft and spells being cast. I'm like, no, no, no, that doesn't bother me. No one's going to join the weekend movement because of this. I don't buy it for a second. Now you're right, Bryn, that the modern witchcraft movement really has replaced Satanism in that it's no longer it's witchcraft. Now is the, I don't try, I don't listen to the, and it was vital because women needed their own version of it. I ignored the patriarchy. I have my own, and I don't know that they, you know, some practice it religiously, but a lot of them, it's just a symbol of defiance against, you know, anything that reminds them of the patriarchy. So I get that. But yeah, I just, I hate when, when it's easy to dismiss us as Christians because of overreactions. Totally. We at least need to listen before we react, know the actual problem before we react, know the source of our material before we post it. Like what is the actual citation that we're posting? And I get people frustrated with me on social media all the time when I'm like, that's a really interesting fact. Do you have a citation for that? Because I would like to use that, but I'm not willing to use it without a citation. And they're like, Oh, I don't know. I just, I just, you know, copied and pasted this. And I'm like, with no source, like you have no idea whether that's true. You're just like, so it could be the onion research says, exactly. The science. Yeah, totally. We do the exact same thing. Okay. Well, thank you guys for, for unpacking that. Let's move now into our time of Q and R. So question and response. And so we've got a couple of these. So the first one was a comment. If you think back to the, to the question that you posed to mainly to Bryn, and then we kind of talked about it, Chris, about if she, if she was going to, or I guess, let me jump back. You posed, you posed the question to Bryn because it was a social media trend, asking, Hey, if you were going to meet a person in, in the wilderness alone or whatever, if you would, would you rather meet a random bear or a random man? Right. And you have a woman walking in the, yeah, you're a user when you're walking alone in the woods. Would you rather run into a random bear or random man? And six out of seven women had said they would rather run into a random bear than a random man. Yes. And so we, we unpack that conversation. And you can go back and listen to that. Here's the comment that we got from a listener, Chad Larsh. And then, and then can I throw it over to you, Bryn? And we just kind of kick the conversation off from this. So this is what Chad says. I really enjoy this most recent episode. I feel like you and the team hinted at a concept that I find fascinating. You talk near the end about the concept of a risk calculation. If it is a man, there is some finite risk that he could be predatory. I wonder if there is a reward side to this too. I wonder if part of the thought is there would be no chance of a reward and at least some chance of a risk. I'm thinking something like this man could be predatory, or he could just want to play video games. If there is no chance of a reward and any chance of a risk, it wouldn't be worth it. We should for sure consider how we can reduce the risk calculation as men. I wonder if we should also consider the reward side as well. So maybe if, if it, if the man is walking towards you, he has a Dungeons and Dragons t-shirt on, some Cheeto dust on his fingers and thick glasses, which I feel the same. Uh, pass on that one. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm making a joke about that, but still, I mean, what is, what is, what is that comment? Because there's like, there, there's sort of a question in it, but then there's also like just a thought or a thought provoking thing. I mean, I think it kind of goes back to where one of the places that we ended the last conversation with Chris saying, how do we not, how do we get to a point as a culture, especially like a Christian subculture, where we are like, as, as men are not only like making this where this is the exception, like to the extreme, but also where we're rebuilding the idea of what it means to be a man. Um, and like building that for other, and obviously I want y'all to comment on your thoughts, but, um, but it seems to be that kind of in that vein of not just how is it, how do we rebuild the idea of what it means to be a man where when a woman comes in contact with a man, she doesn't just think, oh, threat or useless, you know, not that saying that, that that is always the case. But if like he's saying, if that is the risk of like risk and no reward, as opposed to like, if she thought, Hey, yeah, there is a chance that he is predatory. Um, you know, but there's also a chance that he could really help me out of the middle of the woods where I'm lost. And the chances from my experience with men seem to be higher, that he would be willing to help and would be someone who I could trust. And I think getting to a point, I don't know what that looks like, but getting to a point where that is more of the thought, I think is what kind of what he's saying of like, how do we get to a point where that's more the calculation? Um, because yeah, and there's like another aspect of this that, that I can comment on later, but yeah, that's kind of where my thoughts go of like, I don't know the, I don't think any of us know the full path to that, but that seems to be kind of where this is, this question is leading of like, yeah, I think that's, that would be the goal, at least in Christian community for sure. But I don't know. What are y'all's thoughts? Well, but you, you just said that's already your perspective. And yet you chose bear that, that the most of the men who, you know, you would, if, if it was a man who you had ever interacted with, right, right. You would be more likely to trust them. Right. Well, yeah. I mean, that kind of goes to my, we were talking about this other day at, um, our staff day. And I, I think a bigger question and I am curious to hear your thoughts, but I, after thinking about this longer, I think it goes back to the level of fear that women have of being assaulted, which I think a lot of men don't have an intuition for, right. Unless, you know, they've talked to women extensively about this. And so I think a lot of times the question is not how likely is it that this man is predatory? But the question is, would you rather be assaulted or attacked by a bear? Right. And I think, and I think that is at the heart of it, which one is, is scarier to you. It's like, if both worst case scenarios happen, it's not the odds of what they, what, you know, whether they'll happen, it's the odds of both of them happening, which is the scariest to you. And I think that's like at the heart of some of this. I agree. Yeah. It is one of women's, if not women's greatest fear, which I could say a lot of social commentary on, but anyway, that's kind of, I don't know. That's another thought that I had. So the question becomes, that's, I think it brings us, it's still, one of my funny thoughts I thought with Chad's question was what exactly is the risk reward for the bear? Like she, they're choosing a bear. The bear's not going to play video games or do anything positive. Like the bear is guaranteed to be neutral to bad. It may wander off. There's, there's no hope of it being positive at all. I guess maybe, maybe Disney has destroyed people's understanding of nature enough that they think the bear's going to take them back to their like, you know, their, their little cave and introduce them to their baby bears. Like women with a herd of animals around them. But the notion of either evil, either it will leave you alone or it will not be a positive experience. Yeah, exactly. It is a predator. It's a predator. Yeah, exactly. There's no reward when it comes to bear. I don't, I mean, I assume that's what, I assume that's the case. Unless he starts singing. Other than you could say, I, I saw a bear and survived. Yeah, exactly. I guess that could be cool. I would say that about a man. Yeah. You know, I was hiking and saw a random bear and I, I'm here to tell the story. Yeah. But it sounds like women would feel that about men. I was, I was, I was walking through the woods and I ran into a random man and I survived the experience. Yeah. Like we're saying, well, we wouldn't say that, but apparently a lot of people feel that they, a lot of women feel like, well, and I would, I, I must've gotten lucky that I survived the experience because that's how dangerous men are because they would rather run into the bear that they would say that about than the man who they wouldn't say that about. Anyway, that struck me as, as really intriguing. But I, I, what I agree with that we've been talking about is I, I am a big fan of the idea of how do we figure, and maybe it's just each man has to do his part, that each man has to do the part of being the type of man that if a woman ran into you, she would be safe. Now, she wouldn't see it as a positive. Right. That she would be totally safe. Her experience would be totally safe. And in fact, it would be a positive experience. She would be safer and in a better situation than she was before. And so, and that all that we could do, I think as individual men is to make sure that is true. Mm-hmm. Whether or not we can eventually get to the place where women, where that's true enough of each of us that women would experience that way, but still man, it's, I don't know. And like you said, last time we talked about this holding other men accountable, I think is a big deal. Yeah. Because we've seen that a lot with like abuse coverups in churches and different things. Like one of the things that, and one of the articles that we all read, I've just like a, a secular journalist who bikes all over the US and Canada and different things. And she talked about her experience with this, but, but one of the things that she talked about is just like the culture of oppression, which is like, you know, a trigger word, but I mean the, the culture of women being oppressed by men. And I think one of the things that, that in the church, in churches that we've seen is like when men cover up other men's sin or don't hold them accountable, that like what am I trying to say? Yes. Instead of saying like, no, like I'm a man and I'm holding you accountable as another man instead of somehow covering for you in your abuse of women. That's, that's, yeah, those are, those are two things that certainly could be done is that there's no more, I don't know, excuses made for bad behavior that as men, we make sure we're not part of the bad behavior, but then we also make sure we're part of the people who hold those who do have bad behavior accountable. Yeah. I think that's really good. And, and I think that's what we're going to have to, yeah. You know, I guess for lack of a term, figure out how do we, how do we make sure we always do those? Right. Cause I'm, I'm also curious. Like if you run the experiment back or the, the situation back and you put different people in the place of the random man, right? What, what, what gets an overall positive response and why? So if you have, um, you know, you're a rent, you're a single woman in the woods, you run into, would you rather run into a random bear or a random clergyman dressed like in, or dressed in kind of religious attire? Yeah. And then see what the response is. Same with like a police officer or something like that. I'm not saying that that would solve what we're looking for, but I'm like, what are the aspects of those stereotypes that would play one way or another? That's interesting. And even, I even wondered, like Brandon, what you said a second ago, I wonder if the question changed to you are lost in the woods. Oh yeah. Right. Like you're not, does that change it? Walking like, yeah, you are lost in the woods. Which would you rather find? Yeah. Yeah. Would that change your answer? Do you feel like seeing a random man increases your chances of getting out of here safely or does it still the random man still feels dangerous? Well, I think it's kind of a double-edged sword. Cause I think on one side, my intuition is like, Oh, any other human would be reassuring if you're lost. Right. So, but then the idea of like, I don't even know where I am and I'm now with a strange man. Yeah. Like with no, no way of knowing like when other people will come by, like that is even scarier. So it's kind of like, it's kind of a similar question in some ways of like, yeah, if, if I had really positive experience, it could be even more comforting, but I don't know. Interesting. Does it change your response? If it's not just you alone, if it's you and another girl lost in the woods and you can pick which girl it is. I think I'm kind of splitting hairs here. I think, uh, I'm just kidding. I have some friends who I like to self-defense with. Yeah, exactly. Like this. Yeah. Okay. Great. Sorry. Well, we can move on to the next thing. No, no, no. I think, yeah. I mean, I think changing all the variables does change it to some degree, but I think it goes back to the heart of the question of like, what do we need to do culturally to like improve this? I don't know that we can change it overnight obviously, but what can we do to improve it? And, and part of it from like the oppressor oppressed conversation, I think as a woman, the other side of that is like understanding that just because someone is a man doesn't mean they fit all the negative stereotypes of men. And I think that's the other side that like is easy to jump to of like in these conversations. Um, yes, men understanding like how, how women view being at a power differential and being, you know, the abused of the demographic, you know, if that makes sense, like more typically, um, all those things, but then on the other side of being like, just because, um, this, there are some things that are true. Doesn't mean there are no good men in the world. There are no, like all those conversations of there are no men who would protect you. And, um, and, and even that there aren't a large number of those, because I think it's easy to get into that of like, especially if you've had bad experiences, which is really understandable. Um, but skewing it to the point where it's like, well, then therefore all men are bad. And I think that's a danger like that. We have to avoid that extreme because that's also not a helpful, um, narrative when it comes to this conversation. We don't have to talk about it now, but another good conversation at some point, because I'm, I know you know that like in my conversation about what I think are some of the real, uh, wars on women, um, that are going on there. Um, but it's like, well, you know, what could a, if I'm a random man wandering through the woods and I come across a random woman, what are the things I can do or say or whatever to help her feel safe? And that would be a separate question, but I think a worthwhile one, maybe at some point in some, I mean, whether either this podcast or some other conversation, I think that would be a, cause cause I find myself, I have found myself in that position where I am not necessarily wandering in the woods, but in a situation where, you know, I am on a, uh, an elevator or, you know, in a line or, or some situation where a woman is for lack of a better term stuck alone with me somewhere. Yeah. And so how, how do I help her know? Cause I, you know, I know because of my understanding that at least part of what she's doing is sitting there, being nervous or feeling anxious about being alone with the man she doesn't know. Yeah. And it feels like almost anything, almost anything I do or say makes it worse. Like me communicating with her at any level, potentially it's like no talking to her, uh, it's just going to make her feel worse. So yeah. Anyway, I mean, I could talk about now or, or later, I don't know what I want to do, but I have some initial thoughts and then we could, and maybe just, yeah, just some quick thoughts and then we'll move along. Yeah. I think, I think one of the things that makes this hard right now is technology because people don't talk to people in public anyway. So like, if you notice people in spaces just like don't have casual conversation as much. So there's always an element of that. That's like uncomfortable now, which is unfortunate. Um, and so I think now, even though it's sad, less, I don't think silence is super comforting. So I think, you know, if I'm in an elevator with a man and he's just like perfectly silent, it's either neutral or could be a little creepy. But if he just has like short casual conversation, I'm, I'm like, okay with that. If he tries to carry on like a long conversation or it's too intentional for the setting, that's a red flag to me. Um, I think obviously, which y'all know this, but for other people, like commenting on a woman's appearance is typically a red flag. Um, like, even if it's meant as a compliment, like anything about her appearance or her physical, anything other than really like cool shoes is usually uncomfortable for women. Um, and then I would say like, if you're in a space where it's like, you want someone to know if they need help, you're safe, like confidently, but casually offering that and then not pushing the issue is, and maybe this is because of like some of the training that, you know, we've all been through, but to me, it's like, that is comforting. If someone's like, Hey, do you need help? It's confident, but it's casual. If it's too intense, then that's like, they're trying to come into my space for some reason. So whether it's emotionally or physically, if someone's crossing a boundary, um, like we always tell women, you know, if someone offers to carry your groceries, that's like a really kind thing. If you say no, and then he insists that becomes a red flag. Um, and so just like stuff like that, where it's just kind of common, um, curtices where it's like, yeah, just keep it casual as much as some of that's like just a sad side, effective social mean, I mean, um, technology usage in public, but yeah, I think that's like some of the things I think about the only time I get creeped out by someone typically is, yeah, if it's like too much eye contact, too much intentional conversation for the setting, or there's like a personal space that's being, um, like pushed a little bit, you know, like he's trying to get information about me or he's too close to me or any of those things. Those are like pretty common sense, but I don't know. That's like my initial thoughts. Good thoughts. I don't think it's, I don't think it's like a bad thing to obviously carry on conversation with people. Um, yeah, cause that's like how, I don't know, there also may be a situation where a woman needs someone to offer. Um, I talked to somebody the other day where there was a woman and they like passed her as a group and could tell that she like needed help, but they were like, Hey, are you good? And she was like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. And so they passed her not wanting to like push it, but then went back and there was a woman in the group. So it helped, but they were like, Hey, no, but like, really, you don't seem okay. Are you okay? And then at that point she was like, no, I'm not, I'm actually not safe, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And sometimes people need that, you know, that's a good word. And I think that's also a good, a good clarifying. Oh, yes. I think also just like the, um, the, the setting giving, you know, like, I think that was a good clarifier too of like, you know, okay. Asking several questions, even just random in an elevator ride or just in these, but like, if you're sitting by somebody in jury duty for an hour and it's like, you just kind of you're making small talk a question there while they're, while they're still good to, yeah. I just think, yeah, setting does kind of, yeah, does kind of set some of those things up. Because I mean, someone would feel more safe in jury duty, right? You know, exactly. And like in a parking garage. Exactly. Totally. Okay. That's great. Okay. So that's our first, first kind of comment. This one is a question. This comes from Erica minor. And it says, Hey, brain, Chris and Colson. I'm not even sure if you take requests for episodes or if they're planned based on season themes and such, but I have a question slash suggestion. We always take suggestions. Always. We love it. Yes. She said, I'd love to hear your take on the name of Jesus. I love that God was so intentional to name him to marry before his birth, even more so that true to his nature, he would also choose a name that was so common, but also revealed his son's purpose simultaneously. However, I find myself at odds with jumping from Hebrew Yeshua, not to the English, English version, Joshua, but instead to Jesus. Half of my brain says I'm mincing words over mere semantics, but the other half wars with using the incorrect name when Jesus himself says to call and ask in his name. Anyways, if anxiety could truly be, or could truly move a cup of, Oh my goodness, a coffee cup, my cupboards would be flying open over asking this. Sorry, Erica for botching that. That was actually a really great analogy. That was like, cause I referenced in the sermon that anxiety doesn't have any outside power. You can't make a coffee mug move by just totally anxious about it. So it says, nonetheless, I would really love any wisdom and insight. I could glean from you all. Hope you're enjoying the summer break from the podcast. I look forward to hearing it again in the fall. So there's the question posed to you, Chris. Yep. Okay. So as I understand it, it sounds like the question we're dealing with here is what was Jesus's name and what should we call him? And how did we end up with the name Jesus? If his Hebrew, if the, if what his mother called him was probably something closer to Yeshua. And so I can give you the history of it. What I would tell you is Jesus is probably really, really comfortable with being called a different name and different languages. Since every language has their own pronunciation of his name, you can actually look that up online. It's actually kind of cool to hear how the different languages pronounce the name of Jesus. And so that's a, that's something that has some value in it as well, but I can give you the history. The history is that so in the Hebrew, the word that is in the Hebrew is probably, we don't know for sure the Aramaic or the Hebrew was probably pronounced. Yes. Yeah. Shoo. Ah, so Yahshua. And so the emphasis on the middle Yahshua. The Greek who, of course, the Greeks were alive and well in the time of Jesus and, and they would have said Yahshua with much, much, probably less emphasis on the ah, or maybe even no emphasis on the ah at the end, if that makes sense. So they would have been saying Yahshua, probably literally pronounced differently by the Greeks. So that's then that from the Greek is now. So the Greek, the New Testament is in Greek. So Jesus's name in the New Testament is in Greek, right? Because the New Testament is not in Hebrew or Aramaic. So it's in Greek that when you transliterate the letters in Greek into Latin, you end up with essentially the I E S O U S because that's how they made that noise. Yes. Yes. Yes. Or they don't do the shoot noise. They do a suit noise instead. Yes. And so that's yeah. Sous is probably how he was pronounced in Greek. So the Greek followers of Jesus and there were Greek followers of Jesus would have pronounced his like, Luke would be an example of this. Mark would probably be an example. We don't know if they actually met and hung out with Jesus, but their examples of Timothy would have been an early Greek follower in the Greek. They would have said his name is like that. Yes. Sous. And so then the Latin that gets spelled I E S actually probably I E S O U S yes. Sous, which is how you say it in Latin when the Greek or something like that, which then becomes, um, he a Sous because the, when you pronounce the I I E S U S E S S has nothing to do with Zeus or anything else. It is literally just the Hebrew way of saying a name, the Greek way of saying that same name. So the Greeks did not say Joshua. So Joshua is a another name, another English name that comes from that same word, the same root. Yes. She was obviously, that's kind of obvious, right? That comes directly from the Hebrew to English is Yeshua, Yeshua to Joshua. But if you take Yeshua and you filter it through Greek and then you filter it through Latin, Roman language, both of which were live at the time, and then you filter it from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to English, you get Jesus. There's nothing wrong with either one of those. We could have someone could have decided if the early church had gone straight from the Hebrew, we literally might all be calling Jesus Joshua. Um, but we don't because that is not the path that his name took into English because there was no English at the time. English did not transliterate directly from the Hebrew. English transliterated from the Latin, which had transliterated from the Greek. Both of them. Now what's cool to me about that is both the Greek and Latin. So the Romans, the Latins and the Greeks would have been using this word at the time of Jesus, probably this way. The Romans would have called him Jesus. The Greeks would have called him Isoo or Yesu. Sorry, Yesu. And, and then those get transliterated eventually into English with Jesus or Jesus. Again, not an indication of a problem. It's not in the, you are not saying it the same way. His mama said it. Um, but honestly, if you tried your hardest, you probably still wouldn't be saying it the way his mama said it. Um, and I don't do good enough Hebrew dialect. You can look up online how a Hebrew person says the Hebrew word, but, but what's wild is Jesus and his mama and them around would have spoken probably Aramaic, not directly Hebrew at the time anyway. And it might've been pronounced a little bit differently as well. So the good news is when you call upon the name of the Lord, he knows that's what you're doing. And whether you, it's not like Jesus is like, you know, when we say, when we say Jesus' name, he's not like, that's not my name. Um, nor is he going like, who are they talking about? Like that's, that's theologically, it is not a problem that this name has been changed over time. There are Christians who have reverted to calling him Yeshua. Um, and I think there's anything wrong with that. I think that's kind of cool to do that, to go back and call him Yeshua. Um, which would it be closer to probably what, you know, Mary and Joseph and even others would have said to him, but it's not, um, it's not necessary to do that somehow. That makes sense. Yeah. Good, good. That's a great question. And I can see that being troubling for some people, but I don't think it's one of those things we should be troubled by. And, and I appreciate that you pushed through your anxiety and asked the question. Um, it's a firm believer. I'm a firm believer in asking the questions, as you know, that's an important part of all of this. So great job asking an excellent question. I promise you you're not at all the only person who has asked that or wondered at that. And I've even, so to be honest with you, I've even wondered whether I should at some point like switch over and start calling him Yeshua in sermons more often or something. The problem is nowadays that itself might be, might be confusing to people who'd be like, what, what does he, I'd have to explain it each time I feel like. And so, um, we know his name. We know him as Jesus in the English. Um, but you know, if you're like me and you took Spanish class, you know, in, in, in Spanish, my name is apparently something like Christo bar, um, which sounds too weird to me. Sounds like crystal ball. And so I always thought that was weird. And so I, I never did like that very much. Um, but, uh, if you, my name has a Spanish, uh, I had a Spanish class. They always just gave me a different name. Yeah. Just to totally, everyone, totally one or, uh, in the re K I heard there was a comedian named Glenn who used to have a lot of fun with that. He would do the whole like, and then my name in Spanish is Glenn. Anyway, there you go. I love it. Well, guys, thank you so much, Chris and Bryn. Thank y'all for handling those, uh, questions and responding so thoughtfully. And then kind of for the conversations that's put off from that listeners, if you are hearing this and you're like, you know what? I actually have a question. Let this episode be an encouragement to you, uh, that we, we want to hear from you. We would love to hear your questions and take those and hopefully have a good conversation about them. They are valuable and you guys are valuable to us. So we're, we're grateful, um, for you listening and we'll catch you guys in the next episode.
