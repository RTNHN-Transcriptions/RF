We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hey there and welcome to another episode of Reconstructed Faith. I'm Colson Lechner and this week we had the privilege to sit down and talk with Dr. Jim Denison. Now, Dr. Denison has an extensive background that I won't completely unpack now, but it's worth checking out at denisonforum.org. But regardless, Dr. Denison, Ph.D., is a cultural theologian and the founder and CEO of Denison Ministries, which is transforming 6.8 million lives through meaningful digital content. He has published several books. His most recent is entitled The Coming Tsunami, Why Christians Are Labeled Intolerant, Irrelevant, Oppressive, and Dangerous, and How We Can Turn the Tide. We were most excited to hear from Dr. Denison, to hear his comments on today's culture, deconstruction, and rebuilding your faith on a solid foundation. And I was really challenged and encouraged by what Dr. Denison had to share. Now, this episode is broken up into two parts. The first is our interview with Dr. Denison. And the second part is me, Bryn, and Chris Legg taking a few minutes to debrief that conversation. So, without any further ado, let's hear from Dr. Jim Denison. Hey, so we want to introduce you guys to Dr. Jim Denison. Jim is a great friend, not only of mine, but of other members of my family, like my son, who he also employs. What is your owner, founder, creator, designer, chairman, Denison Forum, all of those? Like what does the grants take her out? I mean, you know, there's lots of... So, yeah, that's a great question. You know, we'd love to figure that out. At the present moment, I would be CEO of Denison Ministries. But, you know, a very different friend of mine than I founded the ministry back in 2009. So from then till now, we just whatever they want to call us, I guess. Very good. I understand that. We wanted to get a few minutes with you for a few reasons. One, so let me give you the background of who we are and what we're doing. So in this one, we started doing this, the Reconstructed Faith podcast now, year-ish ago. And the thought was we're running into more and more people who are moving into this, what they were calling deconstructing their faith. And this team started engaging with that question and realizing there's a sense in which all of us are kind of always deconstructing our faith. That's another word for learning, I think. And so the problem is it's like our culture and even sometimes in the church has accepted this, you deconstructed, but you're not... No one's telling them, you're not done yet. So we use the imagery regularly on the podcast of, you know, one of those great building shows of them standing up at the end of the show and going, move that bus. And they move the bus and what's left is just a big pile of rubble. Like, no, we're done. We deconstructed, we went through the demo phase. And so encouraging people, okay, you need to be also in the process of reconstructing your faith even as it's deconstructed because that's also learning. And so obviously I'm aware of what you've done, the books you've done, the podcasts that you're a part of and the worldview expertise that you have. And so the thought would be, part of what we're seeing is it's no longer the natural downhill, so to speak, position to be a Bible believing Christian, even sometimes here, even in Texas or East Texas. And that it's now the uphill position that the pressure is now working against. It used to be everybody wanted a little fish on their business card and that kind of thing because it had certain equity. Well, you are very aware of the pressures that people are facing culturally, even philosophically, whatever that are, I guess, encouraging, supporting maybe is the right word, the decision to deconstruct. That when Christians deconstruct, they're rewarded for that. They're encouraged by that, I think. So that's part of what we wanted to get to your thoughts on what are you seeing the pressures that people are facing that maybe are supporting that or encouraging that or just allowing them to deconstruct and be okay with that. So that'd be a place to start, maybe. What are you seeing? Yeah. Now, thank you, Chris, for this. And thanks for the privilege being in this conversation with you and with your team. Love your church so much. So grateful for your ministry, grateful for what you mean to my family personally. I don't know what you all were thinking a year ago when you let my oldest son be chairman of Deacons, but you survived that year. Exactly. He did great. You got through it okay. We did. And so, you know, obviously a strong church. I mean, clearly a very strong congregation. The fact that, you know, that Candace married Ryan is really the good news here. So just a lot of... Yes, absolutely. Yep. I'm right there with you on that, right? This week. We don't know why. Well, actually, we do know why she did. He proposed to her beside the Sea of Galilee. We were in this building after. They were dating at the time and they went over with us and we arranged a place for him to propose to her there. And the reason she said yes is because she was afraid if she said no, we'd leave her behind. Exactly. Sorry. We only got you one-way tickets so far, right? Yeah. I mean, she won't tell me that. She won't say that. The only explanation makes any sense to me. So that's, you know, that's kind of my theory. There you go. Momentary lapse and judgment. That's all right. I think so. Yeah. And aren't we all grateful? Man, are we grateful. So be that as it may. Yeah. So really kind of a couple of ways as you know to kind of go about this. The first is to look at some of the social issues that are causing us, I think, to have this conversation. People are thinking of the constructing in the context of that angelicals and the context of church in a larger sense and then the sense of faith itself. And you kind of see all three of those happening right now. You see evangelicals who aren't sure they want to be evangelical anymore yet. Church-engaged people who are still Christian, they would say, but not so much wanting to be part of church. And then people that are even doubting or leaving the faith itself. And so really different levels of this. A lot of reasons for that that are happening in the culture. Clergy abuse scandal. Yeah. Massive issue here. Interminding confidence in evangelical or church or even the faith itself. Denominational politics that have been going on for a long time. In Baptist life since the 70s and in others as well. People thinking, man, I just don't want to be a part of that. I'm trying to keep my marriage together and raise my kids. I don't want to go to church and be a part of all of this. You're seeing obviously partisan politics be a big piece of this. And that's not just evangelicals on the right. That's also main lines on the left. You're seeing on both sides of that. A lot of identification with specific candidates and political parties and divisiveness inside all that. You're seeing issues relative to social issues and the degree to which those are being kind of conflated with the church and the faith. Clergy that are praying blessings for abortion clinics on the one side. And endorsing same-sex marriage and things like that. And then those on the other side that are seeing this being really embracing of very hard right positions and cultural issues, that sort of thing. So you're seeing a lot of things that are happening in the culture. But I would say very briefly, and we come back and unpack this as you wish, there's really a larger movement behind this that bears, I think, unpacking for just a bit. Kind of a reason why we're at a place where people feel like they have the permission to do all the things we're talking about right now. So the whole idea of deconstruction goes back to a philosopher named Jacques Derrida, who was in the late 60s, early 70s, a French philosopher, made the name deconstruction kind of popular. Was the first guy to kind of use that word in a way that got in the currency, got in the culture, became very, very normative and formative. My background's in philosophy, my PhD's in philosophy. So it's of special interest to me, but it's really broader, I think, even than that. Derrida comes forward and he says, look, there are two things going on now that we just need to be aware of, that we need to really embrace. Number one, we've learned, and I can come back and impact this vision, we've learned from Immanuel Kant and the Enlightenment that truth is personal, individual and subjective. Can't know the thing in itself, only your experience of it. There's no such thing as objective truth, that it's just your truth and there's my truth. We get that from Immanuel Kant, get that from the Enlightenment and a lot of stuff going on. Second, Nietzsche teaches us that the will to power is the basic drive in human nature. That there's no such thing as truth, that just yours and mine. So my truth expression is an expression of power. The whole reason I'm in this conversation with you is to show off what I know, or to in some other way manifest a will to power. So Derrida says, what you really want to do is come along and deconstruct faith claims, truth claims, artistic renderings, whatever, to understand the power motive that's behind what's being done here, because there can't be objective truth, they're just the artist truth, they're the writers truth, they're the speakers truth, they're the preachers truth. And there's a power motive going on. So we want to deconstruct that power motive to see what's going on here and then find in that truth expression whatever works for us. That's what Derrida says, that's what deconstruction as a philosophy movement started claiming back in the 60s and 70s. Well people that have never heard of John Derrida, that don't know anything about Immanuel Kant or Nietzsche, now live in that world. Now a generation later that the academy has brought forward, what I've just said is conventional wisdom in the academy, absolute conventional wisdom. We have generations now of people that have grown up believing truth is personal and individual in a will to power, so it drives human nature. And so now I feel like I have the freedom to come along and deconstruct evangelicalism or deconstruct the church, deconstruct the faith. I've decoupled my faith from objective biblical truth. I've decoupled my faith from objective biblical morality, objective biblical truth claims. And so now I have the freedom to deconstruct whether it's evangelical or church or even the Christian faith itself in response to clergy abuse scandals or to partisan politics or to whatever issues might be out there. So that's what's given warrant to this whole idea of recalling deconstructionism is this idea that truth is personal and will to power is what drives everybody. So we want to deconstruct that and get to my own truth that works for me. That's a whole philosophy seminar in five minutes, but that's kind of the background that gets us to where we are today, I think. That's really interesting. And man, of course, I'm not at all surprised that you know the roots and the history of the background of that. Colson, you should have looked that up before now. I should have. What struck me as you described that is I think is how powerful it makes me feel to deconstruct. It puts me in the position. I'm now the evaluator. I'm the authority. I'm the one in the position of power and authority. And you've got to kind of jump through my hoops in order for me to agree with what you're saying. And so yeah, that's interesting because we see a lot of that of even some of the others we've talked to that if you don't want to believe it, you don't have to believe it. And so and it's that simple. I don't want to believe that anymore. So I'm not going to believe that anymore. It's my call. That's a fascinating stance for so obviously and maybe even irrational stance sometimes for someone to take, but it doesn't work in regards to certain things like, you know, gravity or other natural laws, but or the we've talked about, you know, the rules of inflation stuff like that. Did you were you going to? I was just going to say that plus the the freedom that that gives right, coupled with all of the things that you mentioned, Dr. Denison, about abuse and politics. And it seems freeing to get to be able to have a reason to get away from those. Yeah, that really does. And there's really a piece of that I didn't mention before, which is the consumerism of our culture. Yeah. You know, capitalism thrives on consumerism, right? I mean, it doesn't work if you're not buying stuff. There's a brilliant and convincing you need what they're trying to sell. So you're empowered to be the consumer every place you go. Right. It's all about you. It's all about what you want. That sort of thing. Well, for a long time now, we in the church have kind of aligned with that in some ways. You know, the seeker sensitive sort of movements that desire and for a lot of good reasons. I mean, absolutely. You want to build bridges to people. You want to start with felt need and move the spiritual need. Jesus started with water and led the living water in chapter four. There's a reason that Paul started with Hebrew scriptures and Hebrew synagogues and quoted Greek philosophers in Acts 17. So you certainly want to be accessible. You certainly want to build relationship, racial bridges. But we can't, if we're not careful, communicate the idea that come to church to be a consumer. Right. Come to church for what you get out of it. Come to church to be fed. Come to church. In fact, my wife likes to tell this story that back when our kids were young and people would pick their kids up from the nursery, they would ask their kids in elementary school or whatever. What did you learn today? How the last did you have a good time? Oh, that's really interesting. Yeah. Was it fun? Was it good? Yeah. It's part of all of that, you know? And then along with that, there's the postmodern relativism that says, look, truth's your truth anyway. Right. Exactly. I had a conversation the other day with a guy that said, look, I don't believe in hell. Like that settled the question. Exactly right. I said it. I believe that's it. Australia said there's no Australia. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I don't believe in the Queen of England. So poof, there's no Queen of England. Right. You know? And that settled the issue. Yeah. And so back to your point, you know, when I'm so empowered that I get to decide what reality looks like, in my opinion, becomes my reality, perception is reality, and I'm a consumer anyway. Right. Well, then your point, it really does empower me. Yeah. You need to accept my version or I'm not buying your whatever you're selling. Yeah. That's fascinating. Well, that works every place else in life, right? Right. Exactly. Design the car I want. Design the furniture I want. It's all about me. Delivered on my schedule and on my terms. I mean, that's every place else in life we're conditioned to think that way. Even in academics. I mean, or in more. I mean, I spent a lot of my life in the academy. I can tell you that it's especially in a lot of places today. It's really pretty terrifying to be a professor. Yeah. Because the student evaluations really determine your career and the degree to which you can get canceled so easily by the social media platforms. Right. And so, and I'm also a medical ethicist. I am a consultant to Baylor Scott and White Medical System as what they call resident scholar for ethics. And I can tell you that in that space, we now live in a world where our patients come to us having researched their condition on WebMD or on some other, you know, which is fine. I mean, we want them to learn what they can learn, but they then come and evaluate professional medical opinion. Right. What they think they know based on 10 minutes of internet research or a friend that gave them an opinion or whatever. And so really, it's all turned around now. The church is no longer the authority, the medical professionals, the teachers. I'm the authority. Right. I'm the one in charge. And that goes back to Genesis three. You will be as God knowing good and evil. So he didn't invent the will to power. It's a basic drive and fallen human nature. Yeah, that's really, that's really right. That's, that's when we talk about in psychological terms, we, we, the, the rejection of labels is another expression of power. Like you don't get to label me. And there was some news material apparently that came out in the last few days, which you've probably seen that, that it turns out that a lot of the nuns, you know, the N O N E S in the, in the reviews, I mean, in the, in the surveys, they're actually relatively, they're actually pretty religious. And so the problem is the question was, who do you affiliate with? And the number of people who are willing to affiliate with an organized group has gone way, way down. But then when you ask them what they believe, a lot of them still agree with statements like, you know, God is like the Bible describes and, and yet, but they're not affiliated with any religion. They're just, you know, and so it's, there's something very powerful and we run into it. I mean, I don't know how often I hear people describe our church as not very Baptist. Oh, it's not like Baptist churches that you, it's different from, and that's something that they quote, take pride in is it's a Baptist church, but it's not, it's not like the Baptist. And because again, the rejection of label feels special and powerful. I'm about to do a start my class with the Forge. And one of the first things I do is I give them a cold reading because it's about identity. It's a class about identity. So I give them a cold reading that this says, and I give them a, have them grade me on how accurate is it about you of grade one grade two, how specific is it about just you only you and so scale one to five. And I get a lot of five fives like, yeah, this is, this is accurate about me and it's only me. And they, I gave them all the same cold reading. I mean, it's 30 something students. I gave them all the same identical cold reading. And one of them on there is in school, you moved easily in and out of various social groups. Whereas everybody else seemed to be stuck in their own clicks. And psychologically, we know everyone thinks of themselves that way. All of us think we were the one person who could move easily in and out of social groups and everyone else was stuck in their click. That makes us feel better about ourselves. I'm not stuck in a click and I move easily. I move and either we all do, which means clicks don't exist, I guess, or, or we all don't. And we're just fooling ourselves. But again, that strikes me as significant in this conversation. I'm not one of those people. You can't label me. I'm not a part of a convention, a denomination, a title of people that I have a stigma or there, there is a name to that group and I don't want to be associated with the name. Right. That's actually, yeah, exactly. I don't want to own their stuff either now or in the future. Right. It might be cold today, but who knows tomorrow? Yeah, that's a, that's a great, I don't want the power. If I'm part of the label, then they have some power over me and that's the last thing I want. Ooh. Yeah, that's they get to. And so it strikes me that there's a real something really or being something is really being lost and that's the identity that the opportunity to speak identity into one another in a community setting and that no one gets to say anything about me, but me. And now transitioning into knowing it's same thing about my reality, but me, which of course is a relativistic idea. Yeah, absolutely. It, I think it means job security for the counseling office and maybe for the church, but I don't, it worries me honestly as to where we're going. What do you think, what are the best tools for Christians to be able to avoid falling into some of these traps or what? Yeah, that's a great question. I think you start, Ken, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. I was going to say and to deconstruct well, like what are some, Yeah, right now. Well, there's a line in the road at the very beginning of the conversation and it goes all the way back there to that whole idea of the truth is personal, individual and subjective. So there's this fellow named Emmanuel Collins. He was an early enlightenment philosopher who says that your mind interprets your senses and the result is knowledge. Now that's, that's a semester of philosophy and you know, one sentence, but nonetheless. And so because your mind is different than mine, your senses are different than mine. There can be no such thing as objective truth. They're just how your mind interprets your senses. The way he put it was to say, you cannot know the thing in itself. I can't know the iPad I'm talking to you on. I can know what it looks like. I can hit it and tell you what it sounds like. I can look and tell you what it tastes like, but I can't know it. I can only know my experience of it. That's the line in the road. We start right there. If that's true, if you cannot know objective truth, then we really are where we are. And at the end of the day, I'm my own universe, right? I am my own God as it were. My truth is mine. Your truth is yours, whether it's sexual identity, whether it's orientation, whether it's what I wanted to fight marriage as, whatever it is, we're left with tolerance. Just tolerate you, you tolerate me. We'll try to get along. We'll stay out of each other's way. We'll do the best we can. But which doesn't work in governance. That's why our partisan politics is so partisan right now because now we're at a zero sum game. There's no objective truth. There's no way to adjudicate differences. So now it's Democrats versus Republicans. And we're all in lockstep and there's this incredible divisiveness about all of this. And for me to win, you have to lose. It breaks down politics. It breaks down so much as society, but it starts right there. So I just want to say, Klom was wrong. I just want to say that. If I can know what the iPad looks like and sounds like and tastes like, it feels like, what don't I know about the iPad? What's this thing in itself? I don't know. He gets that driven idealism that comes from Platonism. We won't go into all that except to say there is such a thing as objective truth and you can know it. Now, I'm not saying we're perfect about it. I'm not saying my mind isn't fine. I've fallen, but I am saying the law of gravity is a law. I am saying there's objective reality and we can know it. For Christians, we can know that through Scripture as mediated by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can use the Word of God to guide us into all truth, as Jesus said in the Gospel of John. It's possible to know truth. It's possible to live by truth. We have an objective truth source in our lives. To me, we start right there. If that's true, well, then I'm going to come back and have all of this conversation all over again under the guidance of the local authority. So how would Scripture guide me as regards to clergy abuse issue or as regards partisan politics or as regards clergy praying at abortion clinics or being identified with specific candidates or whatever the issue might be. We're going to do that through the lens of Scripture. We're not going to do Scripture through the lens of culture. We're going to do culture through the lens of Scripture. I would urge us to start right there because that's the why on the road. That's the big decision. And if we make that decision, everything else follows. That's really interesting because we started this podcast when we started it. The first thing we realized we needed to start with was the very concept of truth and epistemology and that there are guidelines, there are rules for how we know there's the scientific method, there's the laws of logic for reason, there's a hermeneutics for revelation, you know, all and so that these are there and worked through those. And I think our effort was to help people understand you're not going to be able to gosh, as we're talking about this, all that our culture has is deconstruct. There's nothing to reconstruct with. There's nothing to there's no process for reconstruction. There's no there's no plan. There's no guidelines. All we can do is deconstruct under this worldview. And that's all we can. That's they have tools for they have they have lots of tools for tearing things apart. And it doesn't seem like any tools for putting things together. That's like your model of the bus that pulls out and all that's left is the rubble. If you don't believe in architecture, right? Yeah, if you don't believe in structural engineering, if the basic laws that govern effective building of the house, yeah, by personal individual and subjective, if you can build a second story without a first story, you know, that's a good example of the day. Really all you have is rubble because you can't build a house out of rubble without the laws of building houses. Do you think really kind of that simple at the end of the day? Do you think there's going to come a point in the culture where people are looking around and realizing, okay, I just tore my house down. I don't have a place to live. And I have no tools or or wherewithal to rebuild anything. Help. Can someone help me? Thank you already seeing that. Okay. I really do. I think that's absolutely the case. Let me give you a real frightening quote, if I could. Yeah, there was an archbishop Francis George who died some years ago of cancer. While he was terminally ill, he made the statement in 2010. He said, I expected I had been. I expect my successor to die in prison. I expect his successor to die a martyr in the public square. I expect this successor to help pick up the broken pieces of a ruined society as the church has done so often in the past. I'd like him to be wrong about a lot of what I just said. I'd really like him not to be right about that. But his point is that, and we've been here before, when you get to a place where everything is so broken and what broke it can't fix it, people start looking for new options. They start looking for new ways. And I think we're already seeing that. There's an explosion, for instance, of interest in the Orthodox Church on college campuses. And so, there's a lot of students wanting rootedness in history and tradition and liturgy and form. Even if they're not yet past the place of saying, look, this is just my truth, or at least saying, hey, this worked for me. Or built to need each other. There's a communal nest of the human, as you know better than I do, just basic human psyche. Take the coal out and it goes out. And so, there's a gravity toward community right now. Now, I might still be saying, Kantian stuff like, look, community works better for me, or that community works better for me. But there's a moving toward authenticity. There's a moving toward a kind of a community. You're seeing in how a lot of young people are choosing to live. How they're choosing to live in community. How they're wanting to go someplace to kind of settle down together and make a difference in the ecosystem of that culture together. How they're wanting to kind of move in a communal sense forward. We're starting to see lots of interest in some ways that are moving in this direction. There's a fascination right now, especially in younger people with faith that makes a practical difference. Whether that's environmentalism, whether that's engaged in inner city poverty. If you'll go out and you'll demonstrate the relevance of your faith, people are open to the rightness of your faith. And in many ways, just to cap all that up, we're really back where we started. Now, I would tell you the first century looked a lot like the 21st century. You could call the postmodern relative if you want to. You've got Platonists and Aristotelians and Epicureans and Stoics and Cynics and skeptics and emperor worship and Zeus and all that stuff. Plan pilots saying what is truth. You didn't have a printed Bible people were carrying around or putting on their iPhones. And so you didn't have Christians empowered to make any political difference. So when unwanted babies were thrown out, they went out and rescued them. When slaves were being auctioned, they bought the slaves and set them free. When plagues would happen and everybody would flee Rome, the Christians would stay and minister to the plague victims. They demonstrated the relevance of their faith and over time earned the right to speak to the rightness of their faith. And I think we're right back there again. And by Acts 17, six, they turned the world upside down. So if we can be like the first century, I pray we'll see the same results they saw in the first century. That's really that's super encouraging. And it's one of the, Jen, it's so cool to hear that alignment. We actually have talked almost about that exact, about how the similarities between the first century and now what that looks like. I have said many, because I've often asked to teach on marriage stuff that I think the main reason we've seen a lot of the deconstruction we've seen is not about sex, drugs, rock and roll or college or liberal professors. It's because these people were raised in a home where the parents' marriage stunk. And there was no practical relevance. To use your term, there was no practical relevance to Christianity in their parents' marriage. And so it's easy if you're looking at like, well, I mean, what they had was no good. So anybody got anything else to offer me because what they had was worthless. And then if they pretended to be together on Sunday, but it was so different on Monday, well, then I give up Sunday as well. I give up money, but also give up Sunday. That's the reason that I've heard people give for deconstruction on a lot of levels is, you know, the LGBTQ plus community does community better than the church or even things like that, where it's like the application of the things that the church is teaching seem to be more evident in other places, which is a really sad condemnation. But I mean, it falls along the same lines of the relevance of it. Twelve step programs, you know, Frederick Buechner is just one of many people that have been saying he saw a lot more church and twelve step programs than he saw in church. The authenticity of it, the community of it, the mutual acceptance, the unconditionality of it. Isn't that the way the church is supposed to look? I'm old enough to remember the old TV show Cheers. Oh yeah. Right there with you. Yeah. You know, you know, remember the song where everybody knows you. Yeah, that's right. Everybody, you know, everybody's always glad you came. Yeah, that's right. I do know this. I mean, isn't that what we're all looking for? Yeah, that is so true. So it's that much more important that our families, our churches, our ministries keep the lights on so that when people begin to realize, hopefully Lord willing, as people begin to realize, okay, it's dark out here and I don't, I no longer have any tools for even starting a light. I no longer have any tools for finding any light, creating any light. And they start looking around. If all the churches have turned off their lights in order to make people comfortable, then we won't, they won't have anything to turn to. So that's a good reminder and a good encourager probably for anybody who's listening to this from a reconstruction perspective. Going through this process is worth it at the individual level and we will be impacting the culture, I think, as well over time. Good. Any last, well, we want to respect your time. Any final thoughts or words or as we were looking at this topic, I know you've got the tsunami, the, I don't want to say the title correctly, the coming tsunami. Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought. And, which is excellent. I would encourage it for anybody to look it up. I assume it's on Amazon and in other places. And then listening daily to the podcast, you've got at least two podcasts out there. One where you like, I listened recently to the episode where you guys talked about your favorite movies, which I thought was, that was fun. And to get, I actually, so these guys will tell you, I actually do evaluate a lot based on how people can talk about media and movies and books and stuff like that. And so I don't think it's silly when people discuss that stuff. I think it's very deep and can be very insightful. Especially if they're right. I mean, especially if they're true, the Princess Bride is the greatest movie of all time. Well then. Which one, which one did you say? The Princess Bride. Princess Bride. It's in my top 10, man. So you have the Dinnison Forum podcast and then also the Daily Article podcast. Are there any others or are those ones? Okay. Good. Those are the primary ones, John. That's actually out twice a day now. I'm writing a website article every day as well as what we call the Daily Article. And then both of those get voiced in the podcast as well. So this has been really good, Jim. Thank you for taking the time to help us out with this. And we're trying to give people resources, other voices to listen to. I was just talking to somebody, I think it was last week at student camp and somebody was talking about this message that they've been getting at school that all the smart people have walked away from Christianity. That's where all the brains are, all the PhDs, all the... And I said, I don't know who told you that, but they're just wrong. I'm sorry. There's no evidence for that. There's no way to back that. That's just not accurate. And so we love giving people thoughtful, principled, godly people who we can say, okay, here's an example of someone you can look to who's thought through this. They're not just blowing smoke. They thought through this and they know what they're doing here. And so you're a great example of that. And I appreciate that very much for that ministry. Yeah. Well, that's very, very kind. Thank you for that, Pastor. I'm honored to be with you guys today. Again, so grateful for what you're doing, for the authenticity of your church, for the community that you guys just modeled every day, for what you mean to my family personally. Yeah, absolutely. So I'm honored to be part of this. I want to help any way I can. Thank you, sir. We'll send back to you. Well, we are really grateful for Dr. Jim Denison for the time that he gave us and some of the insight and just conversation that we were able to have with him. And so it would be awesome for us to just take a little bit of time and kind of discuss and unpack some of the stuff that he was talking about. And then if there are any questions or anything that kind of come up. We'll put his podcast links and links to for sure the book, The Coming Tsunami, in our show notes so that if you're interested in that. But yeah, was there anything that kind of jumped out at y'all? What were some big things that were like, okay, this is... I mean, right off the bat, I think it was really clarifying and helpful to even hear his levels of deconstruction the way he described how people are deconstructing from evangelicalism and the church and faith on multiple levels and for various reasons. And that was really clarifying to me even to understand there are different types of deconstruction and even different levels of that. And I think it's helpful to know as we're engaging with friends and family that are deconstructing to know just that clear so that we can ask clarifying questions so that we can differentiate between those that they're not all the exact same. That was even from the beginning was really helpful to me. But I found it pretty fascinating. I didn't realize the like how far back the roots of deconstruction as a philosophy or a philosophical idea. Yeah, you know how they go back to the Enlightenment like it makes sense with what he's saying, but then it's like, okay, so the ramifications of what, you know, the idea of no objective truth. Which I believe he unpacks a lot more extensively in his book. Yes, I think so too. But it is it's also kind of reassuring to know because I believe he said before, it seems like this has come on us really quickly. But if you go back and look at the roots, it was very it's been very deep rooted, has been coming a long time and and makes a lot more sense when you start to unpack that and understand it. Because for some of us, it seems fairly sudden. And it's it's confusing how some people can ascribe to some of these extremes so fully. But then when you understand the root, it makes a lot more sense, I think. Wow. Yeah, that's really good. And I agree going back and seeing how this initiates, it's like it's kind of like reminds me of when we talk about the, you know, the onset of modernism, the internal, that's when I teach and I talk in terms of the internal, what's the what has an internal source and what has an external source. And and then in pre-modernism, the metaphysic, everything had an external source, truth, value, purpose, every even art, beauty, everything was outside of us. And then as modernism, as he talked about during those times, it became some things were internal. And where I think the mistake is, is exactly where our podcast tries to avoid is, well, they weren't, Kant isn't wrong. I am engaging in this sense. I am engaging with the world through my senses. Where Kant is wrong is in saying we're totally an island walled off by our senses. And I can know nothing outside of like what I can see, touch, lick, you know, whatever. Like that's the only though I get that information, but that's being interpreted by my brain. And therefore I can't actually know it. All I know is my interpretation. I don't know reality. But so and maybe this is a this is a dumb question. I'm like, why so why do those ideas gain so much traction? Is it because it's empowering to your flesh? Like, I think over time, yeah, because I'm like, sometimes, because when I'm thinking about it, I'm like, from my worldview, right? It seems like, yeah, but that's so like, self centered. And I mean, how can you then say that? Like there is no objection. There is no objective truth. But you're saying that as a truth as a truth statement. So to me, it's like it breaks down fairly easily. But it's been held on to and then is ingrained in our culture for so long. And is the reason for that what what Dr. Dennis Denison was saying that it really is like that empowerment. And I feel power by being able to say those things. And so that's why it's appealing to me. I mean, that's one thing I've even told our students when teaching on identity is the one of the reasons I think it's so appealing is it does seem empowering, but it also it holds a lot of promises like it seems really shiny and it seems it does offer it. It seems to offer a lot and a lot of promises that if you break it down, we know are shaky, a very broken foundation. But if you don't understand how shaky a foundation that is or lack of a foundation altogether, it does seem empowering. And it does seem to promise a lot that's really appealing. Right. When you don't look at something at its source or whatever it at any time. So, you know, as a quite a libertarian, politically, my for any time someone says, hey, we're going we're going to know the government, any government agency of any kind says, hey, we're now going to pay for this. Like, I don't that means nothing to me like, yeah, but it's my money you're using to like, I immediately go to, yeah, that sounds great. But what you mean is you're going to take enough money to pay for people and then give me back my money and probably less of it. I don't know that and I have the same thing, but most I think most people just go like, sweet, free stuff. And they don't they don't stop and consider, wait, what's behind this? So is it like, what are the costs of this? Pay no attention to the wizard behind the curtain. Yeah, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Exactly. Kind of that idea of like, and so it's the same thing that you go that if you say and so what's interesting is I don't we might need to have Mark on an episode to explain Kant, Kantian philosophy. But because it is such a route of deconstruction, but I think I could be wrong with this. I think Kant did think there was such a thing as external objective truth. He just said humans can't know it. Oh, and so we can't know it, which again, as you know, I feel like, you know, Dr. Dennis did a good job of undermining that. Like, what is it that I don't know about the iPad if I've seen it, touched it, heard it, licked it, you know, like, right, seems I've kind of checked most of the boxes at that point of what I do know about it. And also just keep in mind, you can you don't have to know everything about something in order to know something about it. And so you don't I don't have to know everything about an iPad. I've never taken one apart. That doesn't mean there is no iPad. And so the fact that I don't know everything about it doesn't mean there is nothing to know or I can't know anything. And so but or you can't say this is an iPad to me. And exactly. No, it's not. Yeah, that's a cat to me. It is. But the root of these, this deconstruction, again, just like with when we talk about the internal and external sources, is that it hits at some point, you have less and less and less external sources more and more internal inside of us. And in the middle, you get to humanism. And the problem is, if you keep going eventually, you have only internal sources. It isn't that Kant is right, we need good rules for knowing what it is that we can know. That's true. And we've talked about those. The word the wrong where he's wrong is we can't know it. Like, that's, I think that's I think that becomes an abstraction that becomes almost silly. Yeah. Because again, why would Kant then write anything? Because I can't know whether Kant really exists or whether he wrote it or what the book says or what the like, it becomes self refuting pretty quickly as a as a waste. But but how fascinating that that fits in exactly with what this podcast is about is, yeah, we can deconstruct, and we're not telling people not to deconstruct. We're just saying, you're not you're not done. We need to put something in the place of that when you like when you read a passage about sexism and that feels sexist in the Bible. Yeah, what have you been taught about that? Is that right? Is it accurate? Dig in, get get the right insight, do the research. Don't just leave a gap. Don't just go, well, Bible sexist, toss it. No, you wouldn't you shouldn't do that with anything. Dive in and dig in and see what you can build from what is there, what's appropriate, what's not. Versus just like you said, paying no attention to the man behind the curtain. I just don't want to think about it as hard work. Well, and I think as we've talked a lot about deconstructing and humanity, I think it's really hard. That's really key because all of these institutions that have been at some point broken on some level or a proponent of a, you know, abuse or a scandal or some failing of humans, which every institution is, I think often me being my only source of truth can be a safeguard. Like it seems like you're putting up a protection, a wall of saying I, because I think that's what we do as humans is when we've been hurt, we want to protect ourselves and put up any mechanism we can to keep that from happening again. And so being my own source of truth feels like I don't have to depend on anyone else. And I, and therefore I don't have to be open to being hurt again or subject to someone else. And so I think that's another reason why it's important to deconstruct in humans, even as believers, because a lot of the, even institutions that he mentioned of things that have encouraged this movement have been a failure of humans. That's right. And that's, that's how, again, where you remembered Sherrids regularly says like, yeah, this is, this is what we would have predicted that, yeah, you give humans power and some of them are going to abuse that. And some of them are going to abuse other people. That's what the gospel would predict. And so, yeah, that's bad. We don't want that. We don't, we would prefer not to see that. Like Jim was saying about, I mean, it really isn't going all the way back to this garden conversation, but I want to be God. That was why I wanted, I hope the youth, when I talked about this with the students about, you know, what is, I asked the questions, you weren't, you didn't get to hear this, but I asked the question, what does it mean to be free? And what does it mean to be a slave? And the fundamental answer, the students said was being free means getting to do what you want. And being a slave means having to do what someone else wants. And I said, so can't you then just define freedom as slavery to self? If it just means I have to do what I want versus I have to do what somebody else wants, slavery to self. And I mean, if you know yourself very well, you know, you would not make a very good slave master. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to be, none of you would, neither of you would want to be my slave. I mean, I would not, that would not be smart. I'm not that good a person. So why would I want to be my slave? That's not, that doesn't seem wise either. I need someone who, I don't need to be a slave to someone who loves me more than I do, who, who likes me and approves of me and wants me and, and is honest with me and understands the truth more than I do. Because I'm not, I'm just not a trustworthy enough person to entrust my entire identity to. I'm not a good slave master, not even to me. Anyway, that strikes me as a painful realization. But I think it's encouraging even how Dr. Dennison was talking about, we're seeing this change in culture already. Like we're seeing the realization that we do have rebel and no tools. And I think that's encouraging. Because when you think about it, like even when it comes to, quote unquote, building your own identity or defining your own identity with the rise of being aware of mental health, I feel like people realize we're not, we're not dependable. Like every day, if I'm aware of what's going on in myself, I don't even feel the same way about myself every day. And so with things like that, I think that's encouraging to me because I think the realization of that is where the rebuilding has to start. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And one of the last things that he was saying, it's something that I feel like weighs on a lot of people's mind, especially when they're thinking about evangelism and sharing the truth of the gospel is like, okay, well, if we're living in this post truth culture, right? What is, I mean, am I wasting my time sharing the truth of the gospel or in like, and maybe that's the wrong verbiage, but it's like, am I just going to be met with a lot of like, well, that's your truth kind of a thing. And, and then, then have to walk down that even more difficult road. And I liked that he was saying, you know, when you, when you display the relevance of your faith, then you're able to share the rightness of your faith. And just being like the, I know we say it a lot in, in churchy language, but being the hands and feet of Jesus, right? Being there when things are difficult and showing that, Hey, the Bible speaks to caring for the marginalized and caring for the fatherless and caring for people who are suffering and, and being, being in those situations, then can kind of lend itself to people listening to you as well. Yeah. Very good. That was, that was a good, that was a helpful, I hope it's helpful to our listeners out there to get to hear from Dr. Denison. And again, lovely opportunity to get to connect to someone who offers insight value. I mean, obviously, anyone who knows Jim, he's wicked smart. And, and another good example of someone who, who isn't easy to just dismiss as, Oh, one of those. And so, yeah, I'd love to encourage people to, to get engaged with, with the materials that he puts out on a regular basis. I guess twice a day now, it sounds like, which is impressive. Hey, could we, hey, Colson, could we start? Sure. Cranking up to twice a day. Just kidding. He said sure before he even heard the question. And then he knew what was coming. He could tell over the look on my face. What Chris is about to say isn't serious. He's calling my bluff. He's like, yeah, Chris, yeah, you just take a couple hours a day. Can we get somebody else to do my expense report? Do today. Thank you for joining us for this episode of reconstructed faith.
