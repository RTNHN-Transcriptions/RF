We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes, Chris Legg, and Chris Sherrod. Glad to be back with you guys. Chris Legg, Chris Legg has just gotten back, at least in our time. Yeah, for today, as of today. As of today, he's just gotten back from Israel. She is the 20th. Somebody randomly falls asleep. That's right. If you hear this sound. If you hear yawning, if you hear yawning, it's not me this time. It's not me this time. Good call back. Good call back. Nice. In our series, this episode falls after we've been doing some unpacking of hermeneutics. What is hermeneutics? What is good hermeneutics? What is bad hermeneutics? What that can lead to? We felt like a good next step would be to use and utilize good hermeneutics in unpacking maybe some problem passages or things that people scratch their head about or just have questions about in the Bible. And so we thought first we would kind of jump into putting to rest. How do we deal with Levitical laws? Just something light and fluffy. Yeah, why not? We thought we'd handle something. Just throw it at you really easy. Everyone's favorite book to read, Leviticus. I know. Actually, you know what we can throw out there real quick? Throw a bone to people who wanted to look into this more. The Bible Project guys who we've talked about several times, they're actually going through Leviticus right now in detail. And so if you want an in-depth discussion of what the purpose of Leviticus is, what role it has in Scripture, and in Hebrew Scripture in particular, now's a good time to jump over there and tell them we sent you. I don't know how you would do that, but tell them. Call them. Exactly right. Because we definitely need to reach out to them and see if they want to come visit us sometime on our podcast. If you're listening, Timmer John. Timmer John. I was gardening this morning listening to some of their Leviticus stuff, and it's just good as always. Okay, very cool. We'll see about linking that in the show notes. But yeah, so let's jump into it. Why do you think people... What's the concern here when people are deconstructing their faith? What role do the Levitical and other, what we would call Old Testament or Hebrew scriptural laws, what role do they play in it? Like, what are the questions that it creates for people? That's a good question. I think what's going on in a lot of... Again, I keep going back to memes, but that's how so many people think today. There's a lot of memes out there about... I read my Bible, that's why I'm an atheist, or just a lot of accusations when it comes to the issue of homosexuality that we've got pet verses that we quote against homosexuality from Leviticus, but then we're... These Joaquin contradictions where we're not following other ones. So I just think that it comes up in different ways, but in each way, I think the goal is to either make us doubt our faith or to make Christians feel like, yeah, you follow a really dumb book, or you're just being a hypocrite picking and choosing what you want, what you want to follow. So we're cherry picking or something like that. So I think that's why it comes up a lot. Well, yeah, I agree. And I think part of that too is Leviticus, it takes a lot of hard work to study something like Leviticus. And I think we've been talking about how if we're actually studying God's Word, that takes a lot of... That takes work sometimes anyway, but especially something like Leviticus that isn't the most fun read, I think to dig into some of these questions is really difficult. And so it's easy to just skim over them or just Google like, what does my favorite blogger say about this and just take it at that, then doing our own homework. And then I think it also goes back to the conversation that we've been coming back to culturally a lot, that hypocrisy is a big accusation in the church. And I think this is an easier way or more common way for people to point out supposed hypocrisy in Christians. And it's one of the more dramatic ways to point out hypocrisy if you haven't really studied it enough to know kind of how all this fits together. And so I don't know, that's kind of one of my thoughts. Yeah, I think some of that also comes back to our conversation about genre, right? Like we just don't understand. If we don't have a good understanding of what the genre is, and we just read it as we'd read narrative or something like that, it's just easy to get misconstrued really quickly and just not understand it. Right. There's a lot of... Go ahead. We've said this before, but to remember that the Bible is for us, but it's not written to us. And so it was not intended to answer all the questions we want answered today. And so what we do is we read it with our Western eyes and our modern ways of thinking. And then there really are a lot of things that look weird or we just don't like or don't make sense to us that would have made perfect sense back then. So I think I used this analogy before, but it keeps happening whenever I see either rugby or cricket, because I interpret rugby through American football lenses. And so it looks weird to me and I don't understand what they're doing. And I'm like, how can they do that? That was a penalty. Why are they throwing you in from the sideline? I saw something. It still goes back to Chris, that YouTube video about... The one I showed about the British. The British sports. Yes. But I was watching some cricket thing and the guy hits the ball with his paddle and the pitcher, I guess is his name, grabs the ball and throws it in his bowl. It's called the bowler. The bowler. And everybody cheers and I'm like, what just happened? What just happened? And the guy... So my point is, I will either be confused when I'm watching it, like I'm just don't know what's going on. And if I'm sitting with another American, maybe we might start even making fun of it. Like, this is so stupid. You know what I'm saying? But if I'm sitting with a real guy from Australia or someone from like India where they play cricket a lot, it would be totally different. He'd be explaining stuff and I'd be like, OK. But I think that a lot of people do that with the Bible because we, like Bryn said, we are just lazy. We're lethargic and we don't want to take the time to actually figure out, you know, what was... Why was that relevant then? It would be like... Here's another one that only Chris and I think could relate to. It would be like us going through an old... We're trying to revamp a school manual on how classes should run. And one of the jobs of like a teacher or like the leader of the week for the kids is like, go outside and like, I don't know how do you describe it. Clap out all the erasers. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, exactly. People used to fight to do that. Oh, yeah. Oh my goodness. So what would you describe it? I know what an eraser is. I'm not that young. But I'm talking about a chalk eraser. You ever cleaned out the chalky races? But I remember them. You banged them together. Chalk bust everywhere. My point is, if I'm reading that, I could be laughing and be like, that's so stupid that you do that. Or be like, what in the world is that? Why would you have that in there? Right. Would you do that? And you guys are so inconsistent because you don't follow that a lot today. And it'd be like, well, we don't have chalkboard. We don't have erasers anymore. Right. We don't have to do that anymore. And so again, it's a really simple, silly illustration, maybe. But when we read the Bible, we wanted to answer all of our current issues rather than take the time to go, why was that an issue back then? And then you go, oh, OK, that makes sense because there was or another one, it's like camp rules where you're like, weird, you hear these weird, you know, rules for staff, like no naked zip lining. You're like, yeah, but it's because, you know, you know how you know why that rules there. When you read these weird things, it's like, OK, well, that they had to come over the law. Right. I even have something not to put a baby in this little carrying case. So, you know, somebody might have done that. They're like, this would be perfect to seal the baby in this case. It'll be so safe in there. Yeah, that's it. It is. It is. That is part of why, honestly, I tell people if somebody has a really simple, a simple, if you can, again, if you can go with it with a meme like how come, how come Christians, you know, I think the example you said would say homosexual, homosexual behavior is a sin, but they still don't shave, but they still shave their sideburns and they shrimp and they, you know, mow their lawn on a Saturday. That just shows what hypocrites they are. And if it's something that can be summarized in a meme, then it's probably not going to be sufficient when you're talking about something like the national law given by God to a specific people 4,000 years ago. Right. And how do we know what of those laws still apply to us today and which ones don't? And like, I mean, a great example, what you were saying, Chris, was pretty much all of the temple and tabernacle laws are going to be really, really tough to apply since there's no temple or tabernacle. Or priests. Or priests. But priests to it. So there's a good one that helps us understand because one of the things that as Christians we do is we believe that the teachings of Christ interpret the Old Testament laws for us. He's our rabbi. And therefore one of his things that he had the authority to do, not only as the son of God and the Messiah and the great high priest, was to interpret which of those laws apply and in what ways to this new covenant. And even that is an important concept. That part of why we engage with those quote Old Testament laws differently is because we believe we are in a new covenant. In fact, if you'll, Bryn, if you could grab Jeremiah 31 and we'll look at verses 31 and 32. But so all these Old Testament, these Levitical laws, and some people argue about the number of them. There may be as many as 611, 614. Although I've heard numbers much less than that if you actually count them out one at a time, but it's kind of traditional that there's 611 of them because that's what the word Torah, the numbers that connect with the letters Torah add up to 611 or 614. Anyway, there's a lot of complicated stuff there. But there's a lot of laws about a lot of things. And in a second, I'm sure what we're going to do is break down, break them down into three headings, which again, you follow almost any New Testament scholar in engaging with the Old Testament and we're going to, they're going to break them down. So we're going to do that in just a second into a few headings. And then Jesus interprets those three headings in different ways, how he engages with them. But the idea that there's going to be a new covenant and a covenant just to work for Testament, by the way, a New Testament, a new code, a new ethic, a new whatever that is prophesied in Hebrew scripture. So, and in fact, many people in Judaism today are still waiting for that. It's not that they don't think that's possible. They just don't think it's happened yet. So if you could read Jeremiah 31, 31 and 32 for us. Yep. Behold, the days are coming declares the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. Not like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. My covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. That's 32. Is that 32? Okay. So again, you want me to read 33? If it seems appropriate, you can. Well, that's right. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the Lord. I will put my law within them and I will write it on their hearts and I will be their God and they shall be my people. There you go. So there's a new, there's going to be a new way that God engages with his people. And then we get in the New Testament and the new in the gospel, new covenant is that the covenant isn't just for the nation of Israel. It is for the people who fall under the heading of Israel, meaning his people, his chosen people. And again, we could unpack Romans, the book of Romans, which really unpacks that concept a lot. As Paul really wrestles through what it means that we are now that we as Gentiles can be part of that new covenant. But that's significant. It's significant. There is going to be a new covenant. So I got another one, Colson, if you want to grab this one. It applies to this and I'll view, I know we've used this analogy before, but it seems like it's worth saying again before we unwrap it. So in Matthew 5, 17 and 18. So this is Jesus teaching us about his, his message about the law. Great. So Matthew five verse 17 and 18. I believe that's right. Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Very good. So we already mentioned an example of something being fulfilled when we talked about the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle, so be just getting back from Israel and being in Shiloh or Shiloh where the tabernacle was for almost 400 years. It was very confusing for a number of the Christians who were there with us, because as Christians, they think of everything as being the same thing. Synagogues, temper, tabernacle, temple, church, all those things are the same word. And so it was very difficult to help them understand those aren't the same thing at all. Like there's only one temple. There's a synagogue in each community or multiple synagogues in each, they're like fellowship halls, but there's only one place that you worship God in person because he's only in one place to be worshiped that way. He only abides in one place. That was the idea then. That had been at the tabernacle before it was at the temple. So the tabernacle became obsolete. Its purpose was fulfilled at the construction of the temple. So you didn't need to have a tabernacle and a temple. It's not that the tabernacle wasn't important. It wasn't abolished. It was just fulfilled. Its purpose was fulfilled. I've used the example probably on the podcast before, but now it's even more direct because I have a son who's engaged right now. And they have, as I say, strategically and maliciously planned to end their engagement. I mean, they just straight up said like, you know what, we're breaking up our engagement. It's just going to be over on August 12th. They're ending their engagement. It's just done. And that's of course, because that's the day they're getting married. And so their engagement will be done. It will be outdated. It will be obsolete. Hopefully my son will not make the mistake that I did. I introduced my wife. My fiance is my girlfriend several times until she reminded me. And then my wife is my fiance still several times until she reminded me not to do that. So whack. Exactly. But the reason is, it's not that my dating relationship with my wife is, it's not that it was abolished. It was fulfilled in our engagement. And our engagement was fulfilled in our marriage. It's not, like, that's what Jesus is saying. Does it mean it's not important? Yeah, it didn't matter. It's not significant. And there are lessons to be learned from our dating life and our engagement life. And there are ways that you should still see evidence of our dating life in our marriage, evidence of our engagement in our marriage. There's things that you take from your engagement life that you apply. But like my son and I were talking about, you know, what it's going to be like in a month when he's getting married. And one of the coolest things is I told him, it's, you know, now I've been married 30 years, that it's like a sleepover with your best friend every night. Like, there comes a point in the evening when you go, well, I guess it's 11. I guess I better be heading home. Oh, no, wait, I think I'll stay. Yeah. Since we're married now. Like, I think I don't think I'll go home. And so the, some things change. They become obsolete. Leaving at 11 becomes obsolete. And so anyway, it's just a great picture that Jesus uses there. Now, the fair question is, how do we know which ones to, so if that's the case, then isn't the homosexual laws, aren't those then now obsolete? Haven't they been fulfilled? Isn't there in the new covenant? If we're allowed to eat bats if we want to now, don't, I don't recommend it, but we, but we, I guess technically could, right? But we certainly can have shrimp and lobster, which they couldn't or bacon, which they couldn't. Oh, man. I see. Look on Chris's face at the thought of not having bacon. Well, he doesn't, he's a vegan. He doesn't get to have bacon. That's right. It's better just to not know what it was like. That's right. That's right. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Because, because when we pull things, like when we quote unquote cherry pick from other scriptures, it's like, oh wait, no, you can't do that. And so I think people will be like, well, wait, you said you said we couldn't do that. That's right. But you're doing that. So I think for a second, to distinguish between, and I mentioned this on another podcast, there's a reason why we don't know Levitical law very well, and we don't teach on it very well. And it's what you just said, Chris, it's because it's been replaced by what we would say the law of Christ. But you still, we still have in our Bibles. We didn't just throw it out. Right. So I think that I would, I would distinguish between good cherry picking and bad cherry picking if I may. Okay. So I would say good cherry picking, as let me start with bad, bad cherry picking would be if a Bible verse doesn't support how I feel or what I wanted to say, then I find I ignore it and I find a verse that does. Right. So that would be, that would be bad cherry picking where I'm jumping around and I'm just to like confirmation bias. Yeah. But that would go in, I would say that that falls into what we talked about before. Isagesis, that I'm looking for a verse to mean what I want. Have we ever defined those well? I think we have at some point. Could you do it again though? Exegesis is. Yeah. Drawing out the meaning and Isagesis is putting my meaning into it. There you go. That was a simple way we did before. Yeah. But the cherry picking analogy actually is this. If I'm going to be a good cherry picker, I need to know what's the right season. I need to know what color to look for when it's ripe. I need to evaluate it a little bit and see if there's like bugs on it or if it's got some spot. You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah. Right. Even the analogy of being a cherry picker means it means you got to be discerning. And so I think that sounds like a bad. So being discerning is okay. You're right. That's the difference. And so I'm cherry picking in the sense of I'm discerning, I'm not cherry picking if I'm being selfishly looking for verses that support what I want to already, you know. Right. Yeah. I think Chris wasn't here when we talked about the guy at the parking lot. Yeah. Who jumped all around to prove to me that essentially the black people aren't humans. Really? I missed that one. From the Bible. And he just jumped. I mean, it was a wild race through Scripture as he picked a verse here and then would like finish a sentence with another verse from a totally different place. It was all of the nightmarish hermeneutical errors that you could find. Right. Because you said, can I just record? Yeah, I should have recorded that. I regret that I didn't. I would love to, if I could ever see him again or find him again, I would record him because it was impressive in numerous ways. But the main one being he had found every phrase in the Bible that he could twist to defend his view. And then he was linking all these phrases from all over the Bible. And so yeah. So good cherry picking takes discernment, obviously. Bad cherry picking is when we take verses to support what we already believe. Do you think there are any other tenants of bad cherry picking that come to mind? Is that the primary one? Yeah, I think a lot of times it's just ignorance. And so what happens is someone sometimes maliciously will find a Levitical verse and lift it out of context or even just quote it, it doesn't have to be out of context. And then a lot of times just ignorant believers or who don't know that there's a difference in Levitical laws versus moral laws or whatever, then they get freaked out because they're like, oh my goodness. So sometimes it is cherry picking in that sense where they're actually using it to try to, you know, like we already said, to try to make it look like hypocrites. So the way I distinguish in my brain, my cherry picking is, and Chris, you might have more than three categories or you might redefine these. Is this what you're talking about? The headings of Levitical laws? I don't know. I'm about to see what it is. We'll see what Chris says. So I distinguish between ritual, civil and moral. So we're talking about Leviticus specifically right now. Yeah. Old Testament law. Old Testament law. Great. So the ritual ones, a lot of them are for priests, sacrifices, ceremony and worship. And like Chris already said, we don't have priests or sacrificial system or the temple anymore anyways. And so right away you're like, okay, that doesn't count. Right. They were about how to worship. That's what they were for. How to, in fact, let's look at a real quick verse because yes, those are the same three divisions. Okay. Can you repeat those again? Yep. Go ahead, Chris. I said ritual, civil and moral. Right. So sometimes he's called the ritual ones are also called some kind of called ceremonial, ritual or ceremonial laws. Then you have national laws or civil laws and then moral or ethical. Okay. So the civil laws are more the national rules for Israel under this theocracy that was unique. But mainly it was to maintain purity and separation from these other nations. And that's what a lot of people forget. Historically, you've got Israel being in this polytheistic pagan culture for 400 years. Right. And so God's bringing this infant nation into, first of all, just becoming their own, really understanding who God is. But then also they're still going to be surrounded by all these pagans. And so God is really, really trying to get into their heads. You were to be distinct. You're to be different. You're to be set apart. Don't follow what they do. And so a lot of the weird, crazy things that are trying to be very different is because this is what like the Canaanites did to worship their gods, their fertility rights or their worship practices were purposely like mixing seeds or mixing things or mixing, you know. And so that's where you get these weird Levitical commands about don't mix seeds or don't mix fabric. Right. And so to us, that sounds weird, but then they would have been like, Oh, right. So yeah, so we're going to be totally different. Right. It's just it just seems weird. But what verse were you going to say, Chris? Well, so let's look at there's a kind of an introduction to each of them. So Leviticus 1, 2 through 3 references the ceremonial laws. And then we're going to look at Deuteronomy 24, 10 through 11, 10 and 11. I hope these are right, by the way, to reference the silver. Deuteronomy 24. 10 and 11. Right. Okay. And then Exodus 2013 referencing the moral. But yeah, the national laws, the civil laws. Yeah, Chris, exactly. That was a it's a huge eye-opener for me to realize how many of Israel's laws, the civil laws were about separation. They were they were teaching Israel a very, very important thing every day, all day. Some things aren't other things. This is not that. Male is not female, for example. They just aren't the same thing. And you need to you need to know that you need to have things to remind you of that, because that wasn't super clear in Egypt. That wasn't super clear in the pagan cultures that you're interacting with. Life is not death. That's not super clear in a lot of these pagan, some of these pagan rituals where they slaughter children in order to bring rain, because rain brings life. And God's like, no, see, death, death isn't life. Death and life have two different things to do with each other. And so they're they're constant. This type of animal has hooves. This type of animal doesn't. This type of animal has scales. This type of catfish aren't tilapia. They're two different things that and then and it's not that those were a moral stance is that those were teaching a civil lesson. This isn't that. And it's it's all through so many of the weird not combining like like Chris was saying, not combining fabrics or or seeds or whatever. This isn't that. And they needed that reminder every day, all day. And even with those reminders every day, all day, they still insist on integrating with the false teachings of these other religions constantly. But that was one of the main messages. This isn't that and one of the main ones. So those are all meant to. So I'm going to go ahead and jump to the conclusion here, because they're all of these laws are meant to are meant to are built on the Deuteronomy six rule. All of the laws, according to Jesus Christ and the Hebrew rabbis can be summarized in one law, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That's it. And then Jesus says, and the second one is to love your neighbor as yourself, and that all of the laws can be wrapped up in that. Well, that's what this is about is the civil laws were about loving God well by not worshiping. I, God says, am not like them. So in the same way that wool is not like cotton, and a catfish, not like tilapia, I am not like those gods. And that was a huge message that the people need to be reminded of constantly and even being reminded of it, they still missed it. Give them a second and they're making a golden calf. That's right. It's instantaneous. Yeah, yeah, that that pattern that we see, oh, God is now going to abide. We're going to recreate Eden. I'm going to abide with you. And so let me let me meet with you guys. No, you don't want to meet with me. You just want to send Moses. Okay, Moses, come meet with me. And oh, my gosh, you're building, you're making a golden calf. Okay, you've got you've got the tabernacle. We've got the law. It's in place. Good. Let's start our celebration. They gave to the celebration Aaron's sons defy God and are knocked dead in the tabernacle. Like, we just don't go long time. We don't make it long time facing these things. But that's the constant reminder of the civil laws. You aren't them. And so some who has somebody have Deuteronomy 24 10 and 11. Uh huh. Let's hear it. When you make your neighbor alone of any sort, you shall not go into his house to collect his people or excuse me, collect his pledge. Pardon me, you shall stand outside and the man to whom you make the loan shall bring the pledge out to you. Okay, so notice the Deuteronomy 24 10 11. Notice that's that division. So even when you're doing legal matters like loaning money, getting payment, all that kind of stuff, you aren't them. You don't go into their home. Even if you borrow money from them, or they borrow money from you, you don't go into their home. You're not one of them. And that was that vital set. That was the civil, the fundamental of the civil law is that you aren't them. With the civil laws, we have to engage with wisdom to decide, is there anything for us to apply here? Do we do we need to apply something here or not? And because it's not directly for us, we are not Israel. And that's, that's an important. So that's, that's one of the ones is the national or the civil laws. Okay, good. And then you said ritual and ceremonial. And then yeah, well, I mean, moral, I mean, I said, I said ritual. And then I said civil, which is just the rules for them and a theocracy. And then I said moral. And you've got the civil laws being about the separation out. Is it what a lot of things are? Like maintaining your purity and separation from other nations and things like that. The ritual one is all the, a lot of times it's seemingly weird things about cleanliness things about cleanliness and what makes you unclean and stuff. But right. And a lot of those are those, those don't make a lot of sense to us because either they're the same message. This isn't that, or it's just a reminder that, that there are certain standards that God has in place. And he gets to pick them. And he's decided, this makes you unclean. And we have lots of teachings about the concept of unclean and the way we hear unclean and we think bad, sinful, dirty, whatever. And all it meant to them was it was a ceremonial status, clean or unclean. I think that's part of how you can distinguish some of the laws even with you look at their consequences, right? They're like eating pork, you didn't get put to death. It's like you're had, you're unclean for a certain amount of whatever. So it's not even that I think for the moral one, a helpful one is to look, because we do quote Leviticus 18 a lot about unlawful sexual relations. And to ask is that was that only for Israel or is that for all things? And at the end of that section, that's all of these wrong applications of sexual relations. God says, don't make yourself unclean by any of these for all these nations, I am driving out before you have become unclean and the land become unclean so that I punish its iniquity and the land vomited. In other words, he's saying, this is why these nations are being punished. They were doing these same sexual and immoral things. And that's what's, that's why they're driving out. So obviously it wasn't just for Israel, because a lot of these laws are specifically for Israel. Right. That's like one of the examples that yeah, that it's not just homosexuality isn't only for Israel or only under the ceremonial or the communal laws. So how do we know, by the way, I would add a fourth heading when we're looking in the New Testament in particular, and that's rabbinical laws. And rabbinical laws aren't found in the Hebrew scriptures. They are just applications of it. And especially when we're looking in the New Testament, what we see is Jesus flaunt the rabbinical laws. He does not respect them. They are not, he sees them as not requiring any response from him at all. Rabbinical laws are like when the Pharisees applied the Old Testament in their own way are added to it. Yes. So like when we know the hand washing laws, that's actually rabbinical laws. Not that's not, you don't find any commands about washing hands in the Old Testament for that applies to everybody. And so when Jesus's disciples aren't washing their hands and the rabbis get really mad, what Jesus does is he shows them an actual Levitical law that they disobey because they don't like it. And then he is essentially mocking, Oh, you've created a law and you think I need to follow it. God created a law and you don't think you need to follow it. Then there's a problem here. But a lot of the Sabbath laws, you know, in the Sabbath, the only commandment in the Old Testament is to not start a fire, essentially. And then so in the New Testament, Jesus, and to rest, I mean, you're supposed to rest, right? Take the day off and take a day of rest. But the only direct application is not start a fire. There's nothing in the Old Testament about picking up a mat, nothing in the Old Testament about making mud, nothing in the Old Testament about harvesting wheat. Exactly. Or healing someone. Or healing someone. And so Jesus does all of those things and his followers do too. And they get in trouble for them. In fact, that's the first thing that makes the religious leaders mad at them. Is there is his flaunting of the Sabbath laws and or him telling other people to pick up their mat and do something when they're, it's a Sabbath. You're not supposed to pick up your mat on Sabbath. I mean, you guys have been laying in the pool of Bethesda for 38 years, he gets healed. And Jesus tells him to pick up his mat. And the Pharisees later are saying, I assume it's a fair, I have to look back. It's whether it's a Pharisees or just the teachers and the scribes. But then they say, this man can't be from God, because he told you to pick up his mat. He just healed somebody who's been paralyzed for 38 years. And what they care about is he carried his mat because that proves that when there is no Old Testament passage to tell you, you can't pick up a mat on the Sabbath day, especially if you're walking for the first time in 40 years. But why would you just mix them up? How hard does your heart have to be? Oh my gosh. You just witness a miracle, like the man with the withered hand, and you're like, the guy's like, pick a different day to heal somebody. I'm like, oh my goodness. Okay, so back to your question, though, of like, how do we know if we're doing good or bad cherry picking? Like specifically, when we're looking at Levitical law, how do we know what still applies to us? I'll give you one big one. A big one is going to be the interpretation of Jesus. And this is the biggest and probably the most important. So one, Chris was saying a second ago, one is, does even the Levitical law, does it seem to apply to everybody or just to Israel? And how does it apply to everybody? Like, does it apply only when the sojourner is in your land? Is that the only time it applies? Like with the Sabbath? Or is the sojourner supposed to continue doing the Sabbath after they leave Israel? And so those are some good, you know, another one, I think, Chris, you were saying also about the consequence of the crime can be an indicator. It's not universal, but can be an indicator. How serious a crime is this? Is this a cut off from the people? Or is it a, nah, you're unclean for seven days. And again, unclean doesn't mean evil. It just means unclean. Those are a couple of good ones. But by far for us as Christians, the interpretation of Jesus is the most important. Yeah, I think in general, I just, you just look and see, is it repeated in the New Testament? Right. Jesus talks about murder. He talks about sanctity of, I mean, that's sanctity of marriage, and the moral laws of sexual fidelity and stuff like that. So I think, and then we're told that the dietary laws aren't applied. Right. Like it's, it's actually not that hard to do. I think. Yeah, he directly, he directly overturns dietary laws, at least twice. Once in acts and once in. In the sacrificial system. Sacrificial system, because he completes it. The writer of Hebrews lets us know that he's completed it. And it's now unnecessary. Now, again, it's one of those, like we do Passover here sometimes to learn from it. I don't know that it would, it's immoral. I don't know. I wish we knew whether, like, did Jesus do the sacrifices? I mean, I assume he did the sacrifices every year as a young man, even though he didn't need to sacrifice an animal for his sins, but he probably did, or he'd have been some kind of weirdo. Right. I mean, like it have stood out. But, but how much of that did Peter do and John do and Paul do after? We know they still went to the temple and we know they still practice some of those things, but we don't have a clear description of what all they did and didn't do after Jesus. Interesting. I didn't think about that. That's really interesting. Someone asked the other day why we as Christians, why the Church early church started meeting on Sunday rather than Saturday. And I do think one is to celebrate the resurrection on Sunday, but I think by far it's because the first Christians were Jews and they were, I mean, they had synagogue on Saturday. They had, they had, they were meeting with their family at synagogue on Saturday and they had stuff to do on Saturday that was connected to the Jewish Shabbat, the Sabbath, to rest and be with family and celebrate together and have dinner together just like they do today and to go to synagogue in the morning. And so, well, when are they supposed to get together and sing and praise and celebrate Jesus and learn about him? Well, it can't be Saturday morning. They have synagogue then. And so I think that's why they started practicing it on Sunday morning. And that became, we still honor the Shabbat laws. Why else do we have Saturday off? It's in America. Why would we have Saturday off? That makes no sense at all. And so many businesses don't now, which is heartbreaking to me, sad to me, but we still recognize the need that the Sabbath was created for man. And again, that's a great one that Jesus interprets for us. Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath. Sabbath is not something we worship. God gave it to us. If we're dumb enough to ignore it, well, then we're dumb. We're going to ignore the need. He made it for our sake. We should enjoy it as a good gift. It's not some kind of obligation, and it was never intended to be primarily, hey, this is because I need you to do this. Now, he created a punishment for failing to do it because it was an act of faith that he'd required of them. But he also was teaching them, almost like children, as they left this pagan culture. Here's how things work and their consequences for failing to do this. But think about, I mean, Jesus, like Chris was saying, Jesus could directly instructs in regards to Porneo. He uses the same word, sexual immorality, that would have been used in the Septuagint with those passages about sexuality and marriage. Being honest, telling the truth under oath, like those, Jesus confirms all of those honoring, or think about the Apostle Paul confirming, honoring father and mother, for example. I mean, those are clearly confirmed by the New Testament passages. And I think it's interesting to remember, he actually raises the bar. Like, oh, yeah, it's not just murder external. It's like, what's going on in your heart? It's not just because his point is that hatred is murder in seed form or, or lust is adultery in seed form. And so he's getting all the way back to not just, did you outwardly follow this? But is it what's going on in your heart? So I think a lot of people think Jesus was soft on those things, but he actually reminded people what the standard really was. I don't know if I've ever told you this, Chris, but I had a pastor, Lanny Tanton, who he was my pastor when Bill Clinton got caught having had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the next day, Lanny got up and preached and said, in the sermon, the main difference between most of us and Bill Clinton is opportunity. And Jesus is not impressed by our lack of opportunity. And that's what he's taught through that with those passages. The fact that you're too much of a coward to act on your lust does not impress Jesus. The act that you're too much of, you're too afraid of, of going to prison to murder somebody. And that's the only thing that keeps you from murdering somebody is your fear of consequences. That doesn't impress Jesus. You've already done it in your heart. And so obviously that's not saying, so you might as well go ahead and do it. It is no, no, you're already, you've already dealt with these issues. And so I'm a big fan of, of really when we wrestled through those thoughts, yeah, recognizing the standard that he set was higher, not lower for us on the, on the moral ones. Right. And it's because the moral part of the heart, and it's still based on the same, by the way, those are still based on the same motivation as the Hebrew scriptures were. You shall love the Lord, your God, God, with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength. And you shall love your neighbors yourself. Jesus did not in any way minimize the purpose of all of the laws. And the purpose was to teach us to love God with all, all our identity and to love each other. And so Jesus is saying that those fulfill the law, just as, as his identity fulfills the law. So the only ones we are, quote, stuck with still that we're left with are the ones that Jesus confirms in the new Testament. He and his followers confirm in the new Testament and sexual immorality laws. He confirms being a good neighbor laws. He confirms all of those that he confirms. And so we go back and we're, you know, they're still there and we see those still in the writings of his followers. The family moral, the family code laws, he confirms a lot of those. Another way they're lived out is different sometimes than how we think of them. But that's those are examples. So would you say, you may have already said this, but if, if there's something that Jesus doesn't specifically mention or reinstate, we should be really careful to ascribe to it as believers from the Old Testament. It's not that we shouldn't across the board, but we should just be really careful with the context and application of that. If it's not stated by Jesus and, or maybe the apostles, would you include the apostles writing in them? Yes. Yeah. That's when you still have to engage with them with some wisdom. Is there any wisdom here to learn from? Is there anything that'd be good for us to figure out to apply this from? I mean, it wasn't, God didn't do them randomly. There was still a purpose behind them. But to say, to say that somehow we're under the instruction of those is not the same. I'll tell you a great example of this is the are the tattoos. And so the people of Israel were directly instructed not to mark their bodies, not to get tattoos. Which a lot of previous believers ascribe to, or like previous decade, decades, centuries. Probably. I don't know how far back. Yeah. Anyway, go ahead. But yeah, that's a great example of an Old Testament law that is not confirmed in the New Testament. God does, Jesus does not in any way condemn, command, or anything about tattoos. So was it a pagan? You think it was like a pagan? Probably. Yeah. Don't mark your bodies like the pagans do. Yeah. A specific passage actually says, don't, do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord. And I think that's, that's part of what they would do is it slash their bodies. I mean, you see this with the prophets of Baal and Elijah, they would cut themselves. And it was like a way you got your God's attention or honored him, which is totally what people aren't doing for the most part in getting tattoos today. I mean, if they are, then that would be wrong. Right. But that's most Christians who are getting tattoos are not, are doing none of this. So it just doesn't, doesn't apply. That's what I meant when I said, so what we do now is we have to apply wisdom to it. Right. And so we say, is it, is this a wise tattoo to get, or is this a foolish tattoo to get? Is this a, so we still apply wisdom to it as we do with all of the Old Testament laws. So I apply wisdom to do I eat monkeys or bats? No, that seems unwise. Do I eat shellfish and shrimp? Well, that, that seems okay. So I'm not under a law for those. I have still want to apply wisdom to them and try to figure out what's going on there. But it's, that's a, that's a good way of thinking about this. The ones that aren't confirmed biblically, we still have to have wisdom about, but there's no, we can't universally apply them. Right. We can't tell everybody. The one thing I would add to that, and I know we got to wrap up soon, but some people have said Jesus says, because Jesus said nothing about homosexuality, therefore, we're going to have to, and so that's an example there though of, okay, but did he affirm in any other way? And he affirmed God's design for male and female. And he used, like Chris said, the phrase corneo, which is any sexual relationship outside of marriage, which is an umbrella segment, which includes adultery, homosexuality, all that other stuff. So I think that that's another argument that people have said while Jesus never mentioned it. And so the, but that's the dangerous part there, right? Well, the dangerous part of there is to say, well, then therefore, whatever Jesus didn't condemn, he therefore affirms, which that's dangerous because he never mentioned anything about child molestation. So that's again, or you're using common sense and wisdom. So I would say, I actually would say he does mention homosexuality and child molestation because he uses the word corneo, which any first century, any first century rabbi using the word corneo is referencing the Levitical laws about what is wrong, what is sexually immoral is why he doesn't have to unpack it because it's already written. I mean, it's clear. This is what is meant by that is any sex other than consensual sex between a man and a woman married to one another. And so anything outside of that would be sex with family, sex with a child, sex with some of the same sex, sex with an animal. All of those are directly forbidden. And the consequences for any of those are extreme. And so I think he did mention, he didn't use our words for it, but he's speaking a different language in a different era, but clearly that's what he's referencing. And his followers knew that. That's why, for example, the apostle Paul so unapologetically condemns it because he knows Jesus was condemning it with his language. So as we're wrapping up, the behaviors, by the way, not the temptations, the behaviors. All of us are tempted by sexual immorality, but whether it's a mental behavior or a physical behavior to engage in sexual immorality, those are still fall into the heading of sin. And he even differentiates between mental behavior that's sin and just temptation. I think so. Yeah, I do. And this may be, I don't know if this is possible, but as we're wrapping up, so if someone says something along the lines of, well, you Christians just pick Levitical laws you want, what is a good, if you don't have time to unpack everything with them, what is a good response other than it's complicated? What is a good response to that? Or what they see as a cop out of saying, well, you've got to go back to the context, which I mean, it's not a cop out. But if you're just having a passing conversation with someone, is there a way of graciously without unpacking all of it kind of explaining? Yeah, I just I talk in terms of following my rabbi. So I interpret the Old Testament through the lens of Jesus's teachings. And so that's how I do it. I think that's the, as a Christian follower of Jesus Christ, I think he has the authority to interpret the Old Testament. I don't think I do, but I don't have the I also don't think I have the authority to question his interpretation. And so when he when he interprets it, that's that that I now have an answer. Him and his follower, him and the apostles. Yeah, I think that's very clear. And I just really, I always throw out those three distinctions. Just real quick, right? Yeah, I just go there's ritual, civil and moral, and you got to figure out which ones mean so it takes some study. And so we're not cherry picking in the bad way. But we're being discerning, if you want to call it good tripping. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, some good resources. I think I think I mentioned this book before, but this one how not to read the Bible. Okay, is really, really helpful. Okay, because just over and over again, it keeps tackling kind of modern accusations against Scripture. It's by Dan Kimball. And I just think it's really helpful, just because it acknowledges Yeah, those are really sounds weird, unless you know what's going on here, and it just walks you through how to interpret a lot of total other heading, and that I think can affect people as well. But it's a total other heading than this one about the Levitical laws is, but it's the same God who made these Levitical laws. And some of them are really weird. And seem cruel, and I don't understand them. And any God who would create these laws is a God I can't imagine following. And that's a separate heading. And we're going to attack, we're going to deal with that under the heading of is is God by morals, by modern standards is God? immoral? Is that how we said we're going to? Moral by today's standards. And so we'll unpack that some more under some of the key headings. But a great resource for that one is Paul Coppens book is God a moral monster. Oh, yeah. And what he does really well is he takes some of the very, I mean, the the nitty gritty little picky passages. And, and then we'll spend how much time he needs to to really unpack it. Yeah, okay. That's a good one. I'm a huge fan of it. He does he does his homework really well for that. And it's really accessible, though. It's not like is really you find Oh, my goodness, this is so tedious. It's really like you can you can read it. Anybody can read it. You can absorb it. Okay, I was pleased with it. But man, that's awesome. Great resources. So a lot of great unpacking.
