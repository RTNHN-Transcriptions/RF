We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined as always by my partners in crime at Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. And guys, today we are handling some apparent contradictions. This time though, would you call it outside of scripture, Chris? Sure. Perfect. And so actually, this is great. Chris, I'm going to bring the, I'm just going to throw it over to you. Okay. And then we, and we would get rolling on that. Okay. I would, and actually, you know what? I think this was a question, one of the questions you guys came up with when I was in here and y'all were doing a brainstorming activity. And, and so I wanted to get first where this, the notion came from the failure of Josephus. So Josephus was a Roman slash Jewish historian from a little bit after the time of Jesus. He wrote histories that were, that he worked for, essentially for the Roman government, writing the Jewish history. And it's one way to understand it. So he's not a totally unbiased person in the way he does this. And so that's important to know, but I'm intrigued where the idea came from that Joseph, like why the question is asking the failure of Josephus to mention Jesus. And the reason I'm curious is because Josephus does mention Jesus. And so where did the, did y'all remember where the question came from directly about that? I think it was, I can't remember the website. I meant to write it down, but I am pretty sure it was when we were researching like common contradictions, obviously not all the websites list common ones. It's just common according to what they think is common, but it was on one of those lists, but maybe it was even though, like you're saying that it's not that he doesn't mention him historically, but I'm pretty sure that I did see that. I have my, that specific note in front of me. Well, so here's the deal. This is the, just a real quick search, unpack this for me. So in one of his books called the Antiquities of the Jews, as I understand it in book 18, in chapter three, the works, this is from the works of Josephus. This version I'm doing is a translation from 1987. And I'm going to, I can just read the sections that reference Jesus and, or at least the things straight from the New Testament as well. Well, and I guess then my question would be, if you're an atheist or whatever, and you know, one, what do atheists think of Josephus? Do they regard his works and his accounts as fact? And then also like, what is, what is the implication now that Josephus does address that Jesus? Yeah. Or maybe that's, maybe I'm straying. No, no, no, not at all. We'll, I mean, that's part of the conversation. So everyone who's a good historian understands that Josephus was a man of his era, which means he was, he was by his era, an extraordinary historian. By our standards, he is opinionated. He exaggerates things. He probably puts things into his context to serve his agenda. I'd like to say we're totally different from that, but we sadly aren't. I was going to say, no one does that today. I mean, he, he is a biased reporter of the events of his time period. But, but he really did live through a lot of these things and he really was there and he really did write them down. And so we do have to take some of it obviously with at least a grain of salt. So that's one piece. I'll also reference the fact that some people believe that several editors since Josephus have edited Josephus' writings and sometimes added things in and taking them out based on their agendas. And so, so the writings of Josephus are by no means like, well, I was going to say gospel because as a Christian, the gospels are certain for me, but, but so what you would be looking for is any place where they overlap or where they seem to tell the same story and how is that done? So for example, if we, you're reading through Josephus and all of a sudden there was a section from the book of Matthew in the middle of Josephus, you wouldn't go, Oh wow. You would think, Oh, that's fake. Right. And so because Jesus wasn't a super important person during his own lifetime, he had a few dozen, maybe a few hundred followers. He managed to gather crowds of thousands a few times, but that probably wasn't super rare. And then he died. And then he either came back or he didn't. Right. And those who believed he came back were even smaller for a long time. Um, one, you don't even start seeing any mass conversions until, you know, a couple of months after his death and resurrection. And then it still continues to be relatively small for, for a while. Now, by the time you're 30 or 40 years past the life and death of Jesus, it has a much larger audience, but really it's growth pattern was, it is shocking how fast it grew, but it's not, but it didn't take over the whole world in, in one generation or something. And especially during his lifetime, there was no reason for there to be coins made about him, which is one of our, you know, we look for historical figures on coins. Well, there's not going to be Jesus coins from any time near when Jesus was alive. Of course, why would there be? Jesus was not a writer. We're not going to find writings of Jesus's. We didn't probably, as far as we know, the only thing we have in the Bible that he wrote was in the dirt in the temple. And even that passage is unlikely to be super reliable. And so, you know, there's certain things we should be looking for and not looking for. Now having crossover with historians from that era, though, is nice. It's nice when they mention him and you look for how they mention him. And is it, does it seem plausible that a historian from that time period, a Roman historian would reference, how would he reference Jesus if he was going to? So what we do get though, from Josephus, that's really important, is also references to things we see like the Messianic concept, crucifixion, Roman leaders who are mentioned like Pontius Pilate, they do show up as well. And so that's additional advantages for the Christian, the historicity of the Christian account. As a church, we're going through Luke right now. And so the history, Luke is very much so, is attempting to anchor his gospel in history. And so that matters, right? So we want that to be the case. Okay. So let me show you some of this stuff, like in letter, excuse me, in chapter three, I'm going to start in verse 63. So Josephus's works have been broken down, kind of like the Bible has in the chapters and verses. So I'm going to start reading in verses from the antiquities of the Jews, the antiquities of the Jews. Book 18, which tells you that he was quite a writer. Wow. So now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as received the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was Christ. And when Pilate at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, meaning the Romans, had condemned him to the cross, those, sorry, meaning the Jews, the men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross. Those that loved him at the first did not forsake him. For he appeared to them alive again the third day as the divine prophets had foretold these and 10,000 other wonderful things concerning him and the tribe of Christians so named from him are not extinct to this day. So there's the main reference to Jesus in Josephus's writing. Thoughts? So once again, whoever is making lists about contradictions in scripture needs to do better homework. I'm not, I'm not saying you don't make lists, just do better homework. I don't know how many times we've talked about this, how frustrating, irritating it is when people say they just make a statement like that and then they clearly have not even done in Google search. Now here's part of why that is though, guys, is honestly because a lot of these things were written before there was such a thing as Google and they are still just copying and pasting them over and over again. And so no one checks. This is why it's so exhausting when I, when I ask a friend who's a non-believer, Hey, send me, you know, what, what your problems are or your contradictions in scripture and they just copy a webpage. And I'm like, okay, here's the 17,000 contradictions in scripture. And the first one is it says that God created and there is no God. Like, okay, that's not a contradiction in scripture. Like that's a disagreement with scripture. Let's let's, can we, can we please like, that's why I always say you narrow it down to your favorite five and we'll talk about them. I'm not going to respond to 17,000 on a list, which so far as I can tell about 16,950 of them are just completely bogus and they deserve no credit whatsoever. And this is an example of one. So, so, so that you'll know book 18 chapter five references John the Baptist. So again, someone pretty important later in book 20, James is mentioned as the brother of Jesus Christ. Now it of course is possible. These are not authentic passages. This was an ancient text that a lot of people have had their hands on and it's not like the Bible that we have thousands of ancient copies. I was going to ask the same thing. Yeah, we don't have thousands of ancient copies of it. And so there's enough doubt. Here's what my opinion is guys. In my opinion, Josephus does not settle the argument on either side because of the doubt. So it, I don't, that's totally inappropriate to say Josephus doesn't mention Jesus. Yes, he does. Now is that Josephus mentioning Jesus or is that someone who later came in and adjusted it? We can't, we can't know for certain. Now I tell you in my, I read it and it reads to me like Josephus and it reads to me sort of at least some of it, like the way a Roman historian of the Jews would mention Jesus. He's not saying, you know, that he's clearly this. It's like, I think that's a great way to describe him. There was at this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it's accurate to call him a man. That sounds like a perfectly good. Now, surely a Christian would not have even worded it that way. The Christian would have said, and he, but he was no man or he was no mere man. But it makes sense to me that someone like Josephus would go, I mean, they were claiming he wasn't just a man and maybe, maybe not. Like Josephus didn't have a problem with that stuff. He didn't have a problem with the supernatural. He was a sophisticated historian in that he understood the supernatural things can happen. Now, modern historians like Bart Ehrman will say, well, supernatural things are unlikely and historians can only, I don't know if I've ever told you all this. This is my, I would love to debate Bart Ehrman in front of a crowd of people so that when Bart says, um, historians can only describe what is most likely to have happened. Like, and by definition, miracles are not likely to happen. Therefore, historians have to throw out, that's his argument. Therefore, historians have to throw out miracles. Because I would love to ask a room full of people, okay, I want you to think back on your life. I mean, you know what, just think back on your week. Has anything happened to you this week that is unlikely? Everyone who's had something happen in your life that's unlike, in fact, here's what I want is any of you had something in your life that is so unlikely that no one believes you when you tell it. Like when you say like, Hey, my parents tell this story of me going on festival, going on vacation. And when I was a kid, being in a total other state, pulling out of a gas station. And as we pull out of the gas station, I say, Hey, that was Mark. Meaning my best friend at the time, Mark Pullen, a four year old. So he never both four. That was Mark and his family. And they're like, no, it wasn't, you know, like, no, honey, we're in Utah. That's, that's not Mark. And that's not our next door neighbors at stopping at the same gas stations at the same time as us. I insist so much that finally to prove to me that it wasn't Mark, they turn around and go back. And it was, it was Mark, our Pullen and our family and his family, our next door neighbors that who we stopped at the same gas station, not knowing it, like explain that Bart. So you put that down on paper and someone's going to be like, that's the dumbest. What a dumb plot twist that would never happen except that it did. Bart Ehrman is describing fiction. He's not describing reality. Fiction has to be believable. We all know reality is not always believable. Right. Because we've all experienced moments that you go like, okay, that's no, that's could not have possibly happened. Um, not to plug my book, but the fact that, that I got the forward of my book got to be written by the people who I literally would have picked on the entire planet, maybe in all of history, outside of the Bible to write it. And I'm teaching the material that last summer at a summer camp and somebody's like, Oh, we know the Feldens. I'll tell you what, let me give you their number. Jeff said we could give you his number. He'd love to talk with you about with this material. We really like it. And I think they would too. Like, what? That's crazy. That's insane. That's not likely Bart would dismiss it. No, that's not likely. So it must not have happened. And, but whereas Josephus understands that, yeah, even miraculous things sometimes happen. And so he doesn't have a problem putting that in all through his stuff. There's all kinds of stuff like that. Supernatural things. People see spirits and they get visions and they, whatever. And that motivates them, which we know is true. People are motivated, right? Or wrong by stuff like that all the time. And so could these all be faked fraudulent added in by Christians later? Well, yes, they could. Um, is there reason to think they've been altered? Yes, there is reason to believe some of them have been altered, but most modern, uh, historians, as I understand it, that's not my top air of expertise, but as I understand it, think that the, the fact that Christ is referenced and crucifixion is referenced and the Pontius pilot was referenced are at least original. And so you're still stuck with, even if some of the language is not original, the fact that Jesus is referenced at all probably is. Um, anyway, so there you go. There's your big, your big killer of Christianity. Uh, follow up question. Do you think even if it's not accurate, like accurate, like even if some of it was added and he didn't include much in his writings about Jesus, you may have already said this, but do you think it's accurate to say it's because like you said, yeah, like to a very small group of, of people, it was really momentous, but he still, it wasn't like Christianity is like it is today where it's like, he still was a humble, like, yeah, there were miraculous signs and things happening, but he was still a humble carpenter from Nazareth. And so to people in the vicinity, it may not have been as momentous as now looking back. It was, do you think like for someone who wasn't believe a believer, do you think that's accurate or do you think it like shook up the whole area at the time? I do not. So I think remember Jesus's ministry while he was on earth was only for about three years. And so yes, he was probably a pretty big splash in a pretty small pond, mostly in Galilee where he was able to gather crowds of 5,000, 10,000, 15,000. And that only happens a couple of times and it's in Galilee, which is that's, I mean, that's like me gathering 10,000 people to come to a talk in Nacogdoches. In New York City, they're not that impressed by that. And so, you know, the Romans are used to having crowds like that at the Colosseum all the time. Right. And so that would be worth mentioning. So maybe like, wow, a preacher, there's a church that has 10,000 people in a, you know, I'm making fun of Nacogdoches because I, it's like some podunk town like Nacogdoches. Wow, that's impressive. But it's not like the NFL is going to be calling to find out about it, right? Like, no, we do that. We do that 90, at 90 places on every Sunday times 10,000. So that is a like, so that again, have that picture in mind. And it only lasted for a few years and then he died. That was not apparently super uncommon for people to be able to gather crowds for a little while and then, and then they would peter out and then the Romans or the Jews would kill them or somebody would assassinate them or they would just die. But the difference that there's nothing special about that part of it, except for two things, the miracles that are claimed to have happened. And then number two, that he came back from the dead. Yeah. And so I think that's which will be a great next conversation. Maybe we can talk about the different, we're talked about maybe the different views of the resurrection as a conversation for potential that too, at some point. But yeah, that, that in my mind, we would not expect to see tons of hard history from the life and times of Jesus. We would not expect to see that until Christianity as a, as an impactful thing grew in the 200s and into the 300s. And lo and behold, that is when we begin to see coins and decrees and that kind of stuff. But you wouldn't expect the people in power weren't in favor of Christianity for a long time. You see, you see, we have evidences of Roman atrocities and, and, and, and laws against Christians coming in by the, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s, AD, but anyway. Yeah. And it even would have been potentially advantageous for historians not to make it seem like they thought it was a big deal for their own safety. Yes, exactly right. That's, that's another excellent point. When, when the emperor comes in, if he's not a fan, making a big deal about the things he's not a fan of is a good way to not get published and even have your head removed. So yeah, I think that's, that's another thing that's key to remember as well. So anyway, once again, what we've run into is a claim by a website that, that, you know, here's the deal breaker is that the historian Josephus, who would have been a something of a contemporary or nearby contemporary of Jesus and the, and the early movement don't mention it. I mean, except for the fact that it does in two or three places. So yeah, I don't, I feel like that's a, that would be a great thing to have happened in a debate is to have somebody drop that on you so that you could go exactly the opposite. So you're saying that you'll see this does mention him. You'll believe that you will believe because I've got something to share. Anyway, congratulations. Wonderful. Great question. I love when people ask those things. That's good. And I like that that was a little bit of a different, that was a different thing. Like I've really, we haven't really talked much about the historical side of things in that respect. We've talked about some of the historicity. We've talked about some of the archaeological evidence for, for belief in scripture. And so I love that this kind of flows from that as something a little different. Yep. Very good.
