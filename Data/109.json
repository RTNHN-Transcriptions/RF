We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner joined in studio by my partners in crime, Bryn Starnes and Chris Legg. Hey guys. Hey. Today we are, we have some exciting things to talk about. I'm excited because Chris, it's been a long time coming and it's been published now for how long? Oh man, you've got me on the spot. I don't know. We're recording this now. It's been a couple of months. Sometime this year, that's all I remember. So anyway, we'll talk more about it, but Chris and his son have created a resource. Also podcast guest in the past. Yes. Mark Legge have written a book. So can I, I guess what I want to do is throw it over to you, Chris. Maybe give us a few reasons why this has been like, okay, why this project, why this title, why this topic? And then, cause we've, we were talking beforehand of like, there's actually some levels of deconstruction that we feel like can happen within some of these topics that our listeners would find beneficial. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So one of our basic premises here, by the way, it's February 7th of this year. So premises is that we need to deconstruct our faith regularly and consistently be reconstructing our faith. I think of that as just another way to describe growth, for example. So, so I would, one of the ways as a counselor, where I've seen this be an issue in the church and in Christianity has to do with marriage and in particular sex. And so what I've seen is that what the church, the church has made a lot of mistakes over the years. And by that, I mean over the centuries, when it comes to the topic of sex and even what the Bible actually says and doesn't say about sex. And, and of course, that then directly applies to marriage, because one of the things the Bible does teach is that the place for sex is in a covenant commitment, a covenant devotion. And so that we call marriage. And so anyway, unpacking this, because I've seen so many marriages, so many Christian marriages that are just abysmally bad. And a lot of times sex is at the root of what has poisoned that, which should be almost, for lack of a better term, ironic, since that was the special gift that God gave marriage that was meant to make it stronger, more bonding, better bonded, have all these advantages. Like, because I mean, really, when you comes down to it, what marriage is, is an intense and intimate friendship with someone else with the advantage of sex. And so if it doesn't have that, if that is a disadvantage, then now all of a sudden marriage is disadvantaged versus all other friendships. And that's not what God clearly, biblically, what God intended. And in fact, in a second, when it seems appropriate, I'll even unpack what our options are for understanding what marriage is. But I really feel like over the years, I feel like I've done enough counseling with people and talked enough people who've deconstructed their faith that one of the common denominators for those who deconstruct and stay deconstructed is their parents' marriage. And what their parents' marriage exemplifies, what it showed, obviously what their faith showed, but the way their faith has often lived out in their marriage. And so anyway, just going out there. They were a Christian or a nominal Christian and had a terrible marriage. Yes, exactly. They claimed to be Christians. They made the family do all the Christian things, right? We've got to go to church all the time and we've got to be scrubbed pink, which is, that's its own issue, but scrub pink before going to church and all that kind of stuff. Everything's got to look great on the outside, but behind closed doors, their marriage was terrible and there was no affection and love. And so anyway, as we talk about it, I'm sure that we'll unpack some more of that, but man, and Ann versus the opposite, which is kids who saw their parents have really great marriages seem way more likely to have healthy, their own faith as healthy as they grow up, which again, none of this, I guess, it surprises, I think. The Apostle Paul warned us about this. But so anyway, this book is about the first half of the book or so is really about marriage. Yeah. Well, here, I was going to say the title is sex and marriage, subtitle, unlocking and restoring the power of sex through biblical and psychological insight. And so that's really for, so if you've, if you've not messed up sex and marriage yet, then the book is meant to help you unlock the power of it. If you have, then it's supposed to help you restore the power of it. So that's why those are, we had great battles over exactly how to determine how that terminology should go. In fact, I think the last one was in here with, during the in between podcast, we had a last conversation, made some last minute changes at that one. But yeah, so unlocking and restoring the power of sex through biblical and psychological insight. And I feel like if this could be, I did not write it as a pride project at all. It was, it's exactly the opposite. It's more of a passion project. I want to get this into people's hands and help them understand this stuff. And I really feel like we could really help a lot of Christian marriages with it. So there you go. And I don't know if this is a common thing. I'm assuming it is as people write books and stuff like this for you, Chris, as far as like for an outsider, this seems like stuff that you have been teaching on and preaching on and discipling people's, people through these concepts from the book for years. So it's like, yeah, so it's like, whether you're doing premarital counseling or marital counseling, just in general, or you're teaching a congregation, right? And I don't know where you are listener as you're listening. Just know that like, I think what I think is cool is like, you know what, today, I'm going to write a book. It wasn't, it didn't seem like that. It was more like a compilation of years and decades of learning and practical, researching, reading, and a licensed counselor and a pastor. Then you get to a spot where you and your son can then kind of put your heads together to do that. And then put it in as a resource. I think that is also just a cool understanding of what it is rather than just like, Oh, this is a cool thing. It's like, no, this is just compiling stuff that I already teach. So I actually told a mentor of mine years ago, and by years, I mean like 20 plus years ago, I said, Hey, I have found, you know, I've got this material. I need to turn it into a book. I don't have the time to focus. And when I don't focus, when I write a, you know, I write an hour to here, I write an hour to there. It reads like nine different people wrote it in bohemian style. And it's because it all depends on the mood that I'm in that day. Right. And so, and so I just lack the ability to write in a linear way, unless I just sit and write. And I would have to, that would take 20, 30 hours of nonstop. Right. Well, I don't, I'm never going to have that. And so, and so I was like, I found out what it costs to get a ghost writer. And my mentor was like, well, that sounds like a cheap deal. It's like, ah, you, you think of money differently than I do. And so, and so I waited and postponed and I was like, I'm going to write and I started writing and it all these things. And sure enough, that's how it read. I mean, I could go back and read it and be like, Oh my gosh. Anyway, so, and so I tried one, like two or three ghost writers, I hired, I had them write something and they did not get me. Even if they wrote well, they just didn't get me. And, and I couldn't find it. I was like, I give up. It's never going to happen. Like I'll publish a book before I literally, I'm not kidding guys. I was like, I'll have this book written before I'm 40. And then before I'm 50. Nope, not that either. And so that's what I mean by decades of working on this. I love speaking on it. And I, that's easy for me and to talk about it. And then I'm a feedback speaker. So I loved seeing people's faces and seeing how they're reacting, what they laugh at, what they don't. And, and so just writing is impossible because I get no feedback. Are you understanding yet? Like one of the things we had to do is go through my writings and cut all the times that I'm asking the audience. Does this make sense? I'm literally putting that in the book and Mark's like, dad, that doesn't do any good. Like you can't get, but Mark, but then Mark comes on the scene as a writer. Yes. Mark starts writing. And so again, keep in mind, he's only 26. So I started this process when he was like six, 25, maybe 25. Anyway, uh, uh, I'm a dad. I was born in 99. So 25, I guess. So anyway, um, uh, so, and so he, he starts writing and he says, Hey, what if I, what if I wrote it? Like, what if I became your ghost writer? And I was like, one, I mean, it keeps, keeps the money in the family that I'm paying the thousands I'm going to be paying. And two, it means I get an hour a week with my 20 something year old son to talk about sex and marriage as he's seriously starting to date somebody. Um, those sound like wins. So even if we never get the book done and get it written, who cares? And then he starts writing it and he's, I know I'm a dad, but I think if you read the book, anyone who reads the book out there will go, he's a really good writer. He is a brilliant writer. Like he's, he's just so good at it. And, and so he cans me the first section that he's done. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, this is so good. This is so much better than anything I could ever write. And so he, he got me and he can even write in my voice, which is freakish how he does that. He wrote for Dennison for different people. We are, we are that's part of why he's a great writer. Kind of like a superpower. It is almost almost like a genius kind of a deal. When he, when he would write for Jim Dennison, if you've, if you're not from your Dennison forum, look it up. But he would write for them. Have we, have we, I think we've had Jim. We had Jim as a worldview where he came and did that. That's right. Jim, Jim also came on. And, and so he would write and he could write as Jim. He, now that's not how Jim works. He doesn't have ghostwriters, but he could, he would make his materials that he was writing as if it came from the Dennison forum, meaning more of Jim's tone. And it was, you could read and be like, wow, that sounds like what Jim would write. Like that's, he is, he is capturing that tone and that perspective. And he's now done it. He's writing for several other companies now while working on his master's extensive, extensive research experience too. Yes. He did research for the Dennison forum for years. Yeah. Oh, it's incredible. Anyway, so he starts writing it and as he writes it, so we had, what we would do is we had this wonderful back and forth where he would, he wrote all the way through the book. And then I would read all the way through the book and edit the things that I would never actually say or the way I wouldn't say it or, or to turn something around. And that of course, out of thousands of pages was really, I mean, thousands of words was really not that much. And then he would go back to and make it sound sensical again. We had this crafting back and forth. And, and then of course we have the, which we won't go into the miraculous story of Jeff and Shanti Felden, getting in contact with them. And they ended up writing the forward for us and they write with the possible exception of one book on the market, the best marriage books out there. And so and the exception is of course, this one, but the, just kidding Jeff and Shanti if they were doing this. And I know that like we could spend a lot of time talking about this, but I like that we got some of the background. Just to get a little information of where we got and then this is where we are. And so from there, do you want to launch into anything specific to talk about? Well, I think, I think there's a couple of things that, and we can unpack these and I'll let you ask me, let you guys ask me questions too about it. But it really, I really feel like years ago, I started saying from the stage, I think the main reason we lose students when they go off to college isn't about atheist professors. It's not about, you know, sex, drugs, rock and roll. It is about their parents' marriage. And, and I feel like so many of them, their parents' marriage is so bad and uninspiring, which we would, as Christians we should expect again, if in Ephesians 5, the apostle Paul makes it clear that marriages are a living parable of God's love for his people. And so when kids grow up watching marriages be a bad living parable, a bad testimony, Paul doesn't say living parable. He says that the way a husband treats his wife and the way a wife treats his husband teaches us about Christ and his church. Well, I think that's exactly what happens is that kids see their parents and their parents are teaching them about Christ and his church, whether the parents mean to or not. And so I think that's a, and so they come away going, well, I know what I'm supposed to believe, and I've, you know, done all the things and I've, you know, whatever. And then the first time they see another option of things to believe, they're like, oh, I can, I don't have to believe what my parents modeled for me. Well, then I'm not in, yeah, cause I'm not interested in that. It's not inspiring. And so, so that's a big part of why I wrote the book is I want, I want marriage, Christian marriages. I want all marriages, but I don't know that all marriages have the potential for greatness. And I'll explain why in a second, but that Christian marriages do, and I think Christian marriages should be fantastic. And I want Christian marriages to be so awesome that the next generation is so inspired by that, that they want, like, this is amazing. This is great stuff. I want to be a part of this. Which is fascinating because I, I think you are so right, but I've never heard, until we heard you say that a number of years ago, I'd never heard those two things linked when it comes to deconstruction or, you know, people walking away from the faith. And we, I mean, I think I had heard, yeah, like, if people in their life are living a double standard or not living for the Lord, or, you know, like more vague things like that, but I don't think I'd ever heard it directly linked to their parents' marriage. But it makes so much sense when you explain it that way of how that would contribute or, or even be the main reason for deconstruction. Yeah, that's, that's kind of why and I got to tell you guys something that I love. So I looked up my, I looked up the book on Amazon just then to see, and at the bottom, you know, it has this little thing that says, people who bought this also bought. And the next thing that was the thing that people who bought this also bought was a 90. I was like, are you serious? Yeah, like lingerie. And I was like, yes. That is the dream right there. That you're like, this is on my mind and I need to learn the right way to live this out and look at that. That's what I'm going to say as a woman on this podcast, actually the only woman on this podcast. And you mentioned this in the beginning of the book, but I think it's really, I was really thankful that you started the book saying, if this is a trigger for you because of this, this, and this, like, please keep reading. And I think that was really helpful just because I can see, because we're not unpacking like the entire contents of the book on the podcast. No, no, no, no. Even if someone is triggered for a similar reason of like, oh, there's another man writing a book about sex in like biblical sex. Yes. Yes. Like that alone can be triggering. Absolutely. Because the so many are so bad. Well, yes. And they're so traumatized. And that was like one of my other thoughts when we were talking about how does this contribute to deconstruction? And I think, okay, one of my, and maybe it's too fast to jump over there, but I think another reason this relates to deconstruction and our podcast goal is that, like you're saying, it, it creates deconstruction in general and kids who see marriages that are, that are bad. But also, I think there are a lot of women specifically who have been taught messages about sex and marriage in the name of Christianity and the Bible that were not actually filled with the gospel. We're not actually biblical, but were held over their heads as like, if you're a godly wife, if you're the Bible calls you to this and then wasn't actually founded in biblical truth or, or was founded in twisted biblical truth, which is even more damaging, you know, like the, the whole, the most potent lies are the ones that are almost true or filled with some truth. Anyway, all that to say, I think, I think there are a lot of women who have deconstructed or at least really struggled to have a healthy relationship with the Lord because it's been associated with a marriage that and, and incorrect teachings on sex and marriage specifically. And I'm sure you have a lot more experience because of the counseling world, but just as a woman, I think it's helpful to say that on the podcast of like, if this is triggering for you, like know that, um, that's a big part of why this book exists. Right. Because as you've said, you've heard marriage teachings from people who are Christians and pastors that just completely destroy these healthy concepts. Um, and so I really appreciate that you started that of like, Hey, if you're triggered by this concept or this concept, know that you even listed a number of things. Like I'm not going to say this in this book. I'm not going to say this. Like this is not the point to tell you like, Hey, go to have sex with your husband to be a good, godly wife. Like that's not what this book is. Um, I don't know. So I just, as we were talking about Amazon, I was like, Oh, that may be a trick. And so I think that's helpful for me. I haven't finished the book yet in all honesty, but I think so far I've heard most of the content from your speaking, right? And it has been the most like encouraging life giving, like even as a woman, like, um, honoring and just gives a hope of what a godly marriage can look like and should look like, as opposed to a lot of the messages that I know that my friends have been exposed to. So anyway, I think, I think it's very related to deconstruction specifically for women who understandably have trouble separating Christianity and, and biblical concepts with things that they've been taught. They have to do in marriage, um, that were painted as a biblical view and we're not, yo, my gosh. Yes. So, um, I, I would say her name and she probably wouldn't be offended, but I'm not going to, because if this was through a counseling decades ago, but so another book, um, that, or that when I started in counseling was really, really common and still as a best seller, um, is a book that really is about the concept is that men have certain needs and women have certain needs and that essentially what marriage is is an exchange of needs. The subtitle is about a fair, a fair proofing your marriage is one of your favorite words. Oh, it's my favorite. Um, and so I, uh, so years ago, what got me on this path, probably who deserves credit for this is, um, so I was a brand new counselor. I had given that book to a couple and said, like, read it and tell me what you think. Okay. So that's always how I do marriage books anyway. Cause I'm like, what are you gonna? And so she comes back and says, so in other words, he wants a prostitute who cleans his house. And I was like, Oh, I don't think that was the message. I certainly got the message I wanted you to get from that, but I'm thinking back on the book and yeah, that's actually kind of fair based on how the book presents it. So then my first question was why don't men have prostitutes who clean their house? Because if that's what men wanted, at least some men would have that and yet none do no one does. And so I'm like, wait a minute, that must not be what men want then, which I, as a man, I into it. That's not what we want, but no one had ever made me think about why isn't that what I want? Cause it, I will give away, you know, spoiler alert, but it's a, you know, one of the main principles is that what men, cause I try to come in it. So anyway, when women are women clients, especially in other women have been main contributors and proofreaders of this material. And so, um, and so that idea that what men really want is to be freely chosen by a woman who wants to be freely chosen by him and the Feldens and others research backs that really, really strongly. And it turns out it's not that. And so as I did the research, there really comes, there's only two ways to understand the origins of marriage. One is the socio, the secular sociological kind of caveman theory that there was a caveman who wanted sex whenever he wanted it and a cave woman who wanted protection from any place she could get it from other cavemen and other creatures that were going to kill her and her children. So, so they, they created this kind of contract, this transactional contract where he could have sex whenever he wanted and she had protection and that's how, boom, there's marriage. Now, if that's the root of marriage, well, that's not very romantic. Um, that's not very sweet. And it's, it is a transaction that fundamentally that is what it is. And that's what the vast majority of Christian books, Christian marriage books written in the seventies and eighties and nine, not all of them, some more or less in your face about it really were pushing was that transactional view of marriage. And I think that is the antithetical view of marriage to the Bible as that the other option is that there's an intelligent designer who designed and created marriage and created linkages and parables of it, even in the animal kingdom, but that really the moral choice of marriage. And if that's the case, I don't believe that what an intelligent, loving, benevolent designer would do is create a transactional contract between males and females. Hey, you've got five commodities and I've got five commodities. What if we got together and start trading commodities? Yeah, that's gross to humans who are made in the image of God. Yeah. And yeah, yeah, there's no dignity in that. And so it's what the reason I marry you is because of what you can give me and I will negotiate with you what I have to give you back in order to get what I want. There's like the gospels, like where's the gospel in that at all? You have the cricket noises button. Yeah. I don't see it at all. Yeah. There's no grace. There's no sacrifice. And so the basic premise, my argument through the first section of the book, Mark and mine's argument is that marriage is designed. It was created and it was created to serve a purpose, which was to be that parable of God's love for his people. And God's love for his people is not transactional, which is also a version of Christianity that a lot of people were raised with was a transactional view of Christianity, which was, you know, I give and he gives. We kind of make an exchange. Like I jump through the right hoops, I'd say the right things, I do the right things, and then he'll, that's purchasing something from him or, or he's purchasing something for, from me versus purchasing me, which is what he does as a free gift. That would make sense if that's, if that's your understanding of Christianity and how exhausting that would become. Yes. And then if, if it's more, if, if then the marriage that you have seen, whether modeled by your parents or whatever has kind of served to like reinforce, reinforce that or emphasize that point even more, that would make it all, I feel like that would make it all the more, what's the word I'm trying to say? Like solidifies the, uninspiring. But it's crazy to think about an incorrect view of Christ in the church then becomes like an incorrect view of marriage because marriage is supposed to be a picture of Christ in the church. And then your view of that relationship is messed up. Then the, your version of modeling it is also going to be messed up. It's all, it's just a mess. And so, and what, what freaked me out as a young counselor was how often I would get these marriage books and I would read them and realize I can't give these to my clients because even the ones that I felt like were, were motivated well, which still came across with that general message was kind of this undertone of transaction of this for that. And so. How do you think that happened? Like we don't have to unpack fully, but how do you, why do you think that's so prevalent? Like, why do you think so many marriage books? Well, is it because that sells? Is it because it's like the practicality of who we are as humans that we, we're so used to transactions or is it just conditions? It's all, I mean, I also wonder if it's, no one has, I don't know, is it like a lack of pairing of psychology with the, like a solid theology? That could be, I think, I think there's, there's some great marriage books out there that are theologically based, like the Chan's recent one is really good or some of the older ones. And then you've got these, you know, back in the 70s, you had essentially like, like medical doctors or who wrote books on sex for marriage. Dr. Ed Weets, which you read it and it's like, that's not the act of, maybe it's the act of marriage anyway, but is, I mean, it's like reading a book about plumbing is what it's about, which, which understand in the 70s, a lot of Christians didn't have because sex ed was still often fought by Christians because they didn't want the school teaching it. They didn't want the school teaching it, but they weren't teaching it. And so when, when neither one is happening, you end up with these very messed up perspectives. And so a lot of kids were just getting nothing. And, and so then you get, I mean, literally you would get, you're doing premarital counseling, you would get handed this book by a couple of medical professionals about, and it's literally called the act of marriage. I mean, that's like, it sounds like laying pipe. Like it's, it's even that feel and they, they were ahead of their time and their book got recommended to lots of people, but it still was very much so the, the level of what we understand and don't understand about sex, what we're willing to talk about and not willing to talk about about sex. And especially for women, this weird combination of like, you're supposed to be this hyper prudish, you know, in all areas of your life. And then you get married and then you're suddenly supposed to somehow be like, well, a prostitute who cleans house to quote that client. It's like, that's, that's a harsh left turn. I mean, that's such a juxtaposition and it's, and it creates, and we've talked about very often in the church, unfortunately, and I think we have a long heritage of sex being treated as like a tolerated sin. That goes way back into Roman Catholic doctrine that, that, that God kind of tolerates sex because it procreates. And, and that's, that's why, you know, priests don't want to be married because then they would have sex and then that would be bad. And, and, and so they would be tainted by married sex. And, and, and they use passages like David talking about in sin, I was conceived and saying like, Oh, see, because even David's, when David's parents who were married had sex, that was sin. And anyway, just, it was just a misunderstanding of scripture across the board. And it was so badly done. And it wasn't until a few hundred years ago, even as I understand it, that the Catholic church accepted that the original sin, the concept of, of Eve eating the fruit wasn't just a euphemism for sex, that the original sin was Adam and Eve having sex. Oh my gosh. And so that's just obviously, that's not right. I mean, the exact opposite is the picture in the garden of that these, these couple was naked and they were unashamed. Like there was nothing withheld in regards to that. They were for each other physically and emotionally and spiritually. They were made specifically to fulfill that with each other. And then sin is what marred that. Right. And, and, and so to reclaim, you know, naked and unashamed as to reclaim the garden, not somehow to mess up. Like that's the goal is to get back to having a single person, a covenant relationship where you're saying like, Hey, you and me forever, which I think is maybe the title of Chan's book, by the way, it's something close to that. Wow. It is. And so it's a great, it's a, it's that picture of, this is what God intended. And I think it's there, but we, most of us have come out of being taught at a certain way. And, and so I feel like it's been totally inappropriate and we've seen a pushback. Now, sometimes we see that overdone today and there's some Christian authors who are coming out and they're kind of going with a, you know, a torched earth policy about this or a nuclear policy with it. That's not right either. So about a lot of things. So like anything that's been miss, mistaught instead of centering back to scripture, they just go to the other extreme. Well, then some other, like the other side, that's also not biblical. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Well, that's the, so you've heard, y'all have probably heard me say, I know, Bryn, you have, because you've heard me see, teach it to the youth, but that, that the idea of sex as sacred is the biblical picture. That sex is special. It's sacred. It's a beautiful thing in its place. And it's destructive outside of that, just like the work in the tabernacle that, you know, you, in its place, these things are incredible. I mean, they're connections to God and yet outside of their place, they're lethal. Right. Right. And so in the same way, we run into that with, in regards to sex. Well, what happened was, you know, in the mid 1900s, the world began to come out and say like, no, sex isn't special. It's common. And so all different, all different types of philosophies kind of came together and said that like sex is common. It's not, it's not, everyone does it. Right. And, and I know you, your parents pretended like they didn't do it, but they did. And so did their parents and so did their parents and they did it with everybody. And everybody has sex all the time. And anyone says otherwise is lying. And it's just this, you know, this history that goes back. And, and, and so the truth is everybody just does this and it's all the time. And there's nothing special about it at all. It's just common birds do it. Bees do it, you know, cattle does it. Everybody does it. Humans do it. And the Christian immediate knee jerk response was to say, no, it's not common. It's trash. Yeah. And, and so stay away from that. That's trashy and it's bad. And, and, you know, all, et cetera, et cetera. And that, that was the wrong response. It just was the right response was to stick to scripture. No, sex is sacred. You can't, as a understanding common, you can never understand the great power of sex, understanding it is common. I just got to take to a group of students about this. And so I, I intentionally portrayed this to them in the worst possible light, like, okay, so you're as hot as you're going to get right now. You're in your mid twenties, right? I mean, it's on the erotic playing field. No one's getting much better than this probably. Right. Yeah, exactly. Like enjoy it, boys and girls, because you're going to start the downward path soon. They're all, they all went and bought retinol after you sold them. So it's just going to, that's the nature of when it comes to eroticism and, and you're going to marry somebody because you know, you're good Christian kids and you're going to marry somebody or commit to them. And sex is going to be super novel because you've never had sex or not much sex before. And, and you're, so you're going to be at the height of your erotic playing height of your erotic playing abilities, right? You're going to be the best looking you're probably ever going to be your whole life when you get married and sex is now new and novel. And so you're going to have sex a bunch and then slowly over the next decades, you're going to get lose erotic power because you're going to become less than you're going to turn less and less heads as you get older, probably. And, and the world's going to keep telling you that's all that's valuable about you. Right. And then you're going to be having sex with somebody who you've already had sex with several hundred times, if not now several thousand times. Right. So have fun kids. Like that's how I presented it. And I was like, there you go. And they're like looking all bleak. And I was like, what if though, God offers something better than novel and better than erotic? And by the way, kiss illicit goodbye, because that's still a sin and you almost can't do that with your spouse. It's like, so the heat of illicit sexuality of hidden secretive, dark sexuality, abusive, hurtful sexuality, that that's gone. And now erotic sexuality is becomes a fruit that rarely, it's not the constant production. So, you know, what have you got? And that's actually, we talked about in the book is there, God offers a third option, which is intimate sexuality, which is what is it like to be chosen sexually when someone actually knows you and they don't just know your, your body. And that's awesome. It's awesome when someone knows every inch of your body and they want to make that body feel good, but also they know every inch, they know you, they're your heart and your soul and your mind, and they're still wanting to go to bed with you. Like that's really being chosen. And so with that, that just grows. And again, the research backs this couples who work hard to have a good marriage, often report higher satisfaction rates, even about sex after 30 years, 40 years, 50 years of marriage, then they did as honeymooners. The world would be like, what? What? That makes no sense. You're right. Unless there's something better than you throw all of the best you've got against the wall and still people who've been married 40 years are happier. Now, not all of them, because a lot of them have, they live in these dead marriages and they have for 30 years at that point. And now, now you've got marriages that are ending two years into the marriage. They're sexless because of addictions and stuff like that. But anyway, that's the principle of the book is how do we create such an awesome marriage that our kids are inspired. We're inspired. Husbands and wives are inspired by each other in their faith and to continue to grow that. And again, it's an answer that as so far as I can tell, by the way, only God offers. No one else is offering intimacy as the solution to the loss of novelty, to the loss of eroticism, which are given things. Everybody else is killing themselves and slicing up their bodies, trying to maintain their eroticism or whatever. And it's crazy making. Or you could have someone choose you even when you're old and gray and wrinkled. It does not require Christianity to have that, but it requires a vision bigger than anything the world has to offer to have that. So I love it. I think it's a beautiful picture. And I love that Ginger and I have now had several people reach out to us and say, based on y'all's marriage, we want you to do our premarital counseling. We want you to talk through with us. It's like the highest compliment for marriage. Oh my gosh, so awesome. And it's kind of weird now I'm at that age where I'm publishing a book and the old Christian marriage books always had a picture of the couple on the back and you would like 20 or 30 years, it does not age well. Yeah, not at all. The dude in the polyester suit with his wife with the big hair, you know, hive, beehive hair. And you're like, I don't want to think about them having sex. Stop putting that on the cover of the like. So anyway, we intentionally didn't do that. But that's why we went with a very tame picture of a door in a garden. Yes. Those are two of the analogies we use in the book. So okay, I want that to be the case. And here's what makes you so if any of you out there who are deconstructors understand if you're deconstructing largely because of the way your parents taught or because of your parents' marriage or the way you were taught about sex and marriage and now you've begun to think, wait, I don't get to be a free moral agent in regards to sex in my marriage if I'm a Christian, understand, that's not the teaching of Christianity. That's not what Christ was trying to teach. And so as it's so often the case, we're actually deconstructing either people, which we always highly recommend, or you're deconstructing faith in a God who doesn't exist in a series of truth claims that are wrong. And we need to always deconstruct those. Yeah. And that's my opinion. Yeah. And I mean, I would just add to that. Like from my perspective, I think sometimes there are ways in which what we've been taught Mars, our view of God, and we don't realize that until those start being brought to light. And so this is totally one of those in my mind of, like, there may be couples out there who think their marriage is fine, you know, may even have a misunderstanding of some of these things that have happened for, have been an understanding for so long that they don't realize it. And yet it's affecting your view of God. And so, and his, like, what he's asking of you and what he's provided for you and what the, like we said earlier, what the picture of Christ in the church even is. And so even if you wouldn't consider yourself currently deconstructing, I think digging into healthy theology on something like sex and marriage, whether or not you're married, I think can always help you draw closer to the Lord and, and even correct views of him that, that you may not realize are harming you, if that makes sense. So yeah, just an additional thought. Wonderful. Well, if you're looking for it on Amazon, the book is Sex and Marriage, Unlocking and Restoring the Power of Sex through Biblical and Psychological Insight. Chris, thanks for taking time to talk about this. I know you're not big on kind of self-promotion. I'm so bad at it. Colson and I are telling you, go buy the book. I need to be better. I really do. But, but I think it, it can be really beneficial. So thanks guys. Thank you for joining us for this episode of Reconstructed Faith.
