We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner, and I'm joined by Chris Legge and Brent Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner, joined as always by my partners in crime, Brent Starnes and Chris Legge. And today we're talking about Christian overreactions. I was trying to figure out something to overreact about already, but there was nothing that came to my mind. Today we're talking about Harry Potter. Oh my God. Witchcraft. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Anyway, Christian overreactions. And Chris, you were the one who sent out a message to us about this. Do you want to just explain kind of how this, because you did make an interesting statement in one of the most recent podcasts that we recorded of like, if this was going to push you to deconstruct, it would probably be an overreaction. And you know what I mean? It's overreaction. Deconstructing might be an overreaction. Oh yes, fair enough. But also, yeah, the way Christians react to things or overreact to things has been off putting to me since childhood. Oh yeah. I want to hear you unpack that a little. Oh my gosh. And so I, it is, I think I know that I have a strange, like I'm exactly the right age that I've grown up through this transition of Christianity kind of returning to, hey, science can be okay type of thinking versus, you know, which is, which was the stance throughout the medieval era, all the way into the romantic era. And then somewhere in there, Christians decided like, no, by definition, science is our enemy. And if, if science dig up bones, it must be the devil, you know, and that was, and, and so, you know, if, if, if Copernicus says the sun rotates, you know, the, the sun earth rotates around the sun, that's proof that he's horrible and evil and cause it's not what we always thought. And, and just the level of theological pride that I think has saturated Christians and Christianity over the years is something that people rightly respond to. And I don't, but I don't think it's necessary to deconstruct with, but it's the kind of thing. So I, I have a, to this day, and it kind of reminds me of the, of the purity culture thing. I have a, I don't know, resentment is too strong a word, but some level of resentment over missing Halloween several years in a row as a young person, not getting to go out with my friends and not getting to dress up and not getting to trick or treat and all those kinds of things. And it was because with apparently we had recently discovered that Halloween was the devil's day. And that that's, you know, that, that the Lord, this is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it, unless it's October 31st, in which case it's the devil's day and it's his. And so, which obviously I'm mocking because I think that's a terrible understanding. It doesn't mean that everyone should be involved. It obviously it's like any other thing in, you know, Romans 14 for you, the Holy day may communicate something different than someone else. That's fine. If you decide that it's your personal conscience or whatever that, you know, Halloween somehow doing any type of celebration on October 31st is somehow especially bad. I mean, fine. I guess that's fine. I disagree with your interpretation, but that's your right to make that call. But it was such a huge deal in the eighties, late seventies and early eighties of, of, yeah, this is bad. And, and, and it was, so it made sense because Christians are always very suspicious of it. And then it turns out, you know, people are poisoning candy and putting razor blades and apples, none of which ever happened. Except there, actually there were a few times where people poisoned children with candy. Every example of it, it was people poisoning their own children with Halloween candy. And so anyway, so it's just, it's just this, it feels to me like that's been the case throughout history. I remember, so I'm barely old enough to remember when the big bang theory, which was actually uncovered way before this, but did not reach kind of popular ears until the seventies and eighties. And, and all of a sudden it's, you know, all the big bang theory can't be right. And, and what is this that they're talking about? There's no big bang. And, and, and of course the, what was wild was that of course scientists, secular scientists at the time were afraid of getting their noses rubbed in by Christians and Muslims and gosh, all theists everywhere go like, yeah, that's how we've said all along it happened. It wasn't there. And then it suddenly was there. We've like a point in time. Yeah, exactly. It was, it wasn't there. And then suddenly it was there that just like we've said all along and, and in fact, so the secular scientists were nervous about coming out with this, they come out with it. And in particular, the Christians all, you know, lose their minds, put in your overreacting here. And so, and so I, I just, that kind of thing, research comes out saying that there may be a genetic predisposition to homosexuality and it's like, or anyway, I just, I just I feel like this is something I've watched over and over again. I suspect it's been around for a very long time, but it, it was, you know, first it was letters you would get warning you off of things and magazine subscriptions. And then it was emails. I don't know how many times I got the email about the fact that JK Roland actually had a quote that she was looking forward to more children joining the Wicca movement and that she wanted them to be witches. And it was all a citation from the onion, which is an sarcastic online satire site, but Christians didn't even know it. They literally would put the quote in an email and cite it from the onion. Like it would say from the onion, like an online newspaper, the onion quotes her like, and like, ah, the onion is a satire site. And anyway, so ironic since she's now like taking a stand against the trans people, she was always Church of England. I mean, she's, there's a reason why not, not to spoiler alert that when Harry dies, he goes to King's cross station is because she's a Christian fundamentally. Now she doesn't have the same version of Christianity. I do. And doesn't have the same understanding of scripture that I do, but, but fundamentally has a respect for God and his son Christ. And so where would Harry Potter go when he dies? Well, he would go to King's cross station, which is named for the King's cross. But you know, anyway, I just, I feel like this has happened a lot of times. I feel like our conversational purity culture, that was a reaction to the world going, no, sex is not special. Sex is common. Right. And we're like, no, it's trash. You're the first sexual revolution. I don't know why I put that voice on Christians. That's how you hear it in your head. That's how I hear it in my head. Every time when I get those emails, anyway, thoughts? Well, I don't know if we have 30 minutes of material here or not. Maybe we've got lots more. Maybe we got lots less. Let's see. Where do you think? So obviously as Christians, we don't believe it's wrong to take a stance on things. So it's like, like you're saying, if you do have a personal conviction about Halloween or even Harry Potter, like it's not that we're saying that that is the part of this that's wrong. But it is, are you, do you think you're saying, first of all, an ungodly response or a response that is like larger than warranted for the, for the conversation? Um, or is it like the uneducated conversation plus the reaction that is most frustrating? Yeah. So that's a good way to ask it. Um, I have to pay you by the hour. That's a good therapeutic question. The, um, uh, I feel like that's high praise. First of all, yeah, I know that was a very, that was a very real worded question. On that note, I'll be leaving. Uh, I would love to have an example of Christians reacting, having a quick, sudden reaction that was right and well-founded. Cause if I heard that, maybe it would help me. How did I feel about that? Off the top of my head, I'm not coming up with an example of that. Um, I don't, I don't think it would be wrong for anyone to react to something rightly. Um, you know, maybe that's a Google search. What's the time when Christians pounced, but we're right. Um, and, and, and even, but I, I just, I so prefer the thoughtful response that I would, I would almost, I would love for Christians to make a habit of, as a group of being the ones who say, well, let's, let's wait until we get all the information. Like let's, let's wait until we've actually read the Harry Potter books before we decide that they're evil. Like let's, the fact that they're about witches. Okay. Fair. I'll give that a yellow flag. I mean, line of which in the wardrobe is about witches too, but let's look at it and see what the messaging is here and what are the real, that one's on my, I mean, with my age, these are the ones that have hit during my lifetime, big bang and, and Halloween and, and Harry Potter are examples of that. Just the age of the earth. Like we, you know, somebody digs up an old skeleton and like, no, it must be lies like, or it could be that we've been misinterpreting scripture and we always have to be humble enough to accept that it's, it isn't scripture that's going to be wrong, but our interpretation of scripture could be wrong. And so, I mean, we're compromising. Right. Yeah. I just, I, anyway, I, yeah, I mean, and I'm trying to stay out of the political realm because all politician, all political stuff is pouncing. It's it all is like, Oh, Oh, you said this wrong today. And so we're jumping. It's, um, and that's a, that's not a side thing. It was a, um, you know, one, one day the economy is good and so ever is in charge. It's, we're totally in charge of the economy. That's why it's good. And the next day the economy is bad and they're like, no, we have nothing to do with the economy. No, you're totally in charge of the economy. That's why it's so bad. And like, or, or you could, I mean, I just, I have, you know, no trust in even the motives, much less the play out of the politicians. And so I think these are, these are not, these are not badly motivated people. The ones who are coming out against the age of the earth, the earth being old or the big bang theory or, or the purity culture or even probably the, you know, anti-star Wars or anti, you know, whatever. I don't know that they're badly motivated. They're just so often either ignorant or poorly thought out. So do you think when you say you would, it would have, it could have pushed you to deconstruction like in another life or in another situation. Do you think that's the piece of it that would have caused deconstruction is just the fact that create Christians are reacting in a way that is a not a reflection of Christ, but then also not engaging with the topics. Well, do you think that's like the piece of it that would cause deconstruction? You know what I'm saying? Like Christian specifically. I don't, yeah, that's interesting. I don't know that I would have ever deconstructed my faith in Christ. And I think maybe I did go through a little bit of a deconstruction of I'm not one of these people, but so my decision was I will, I would rather be involved in improving and changing this than like, I don't think they mean to be one of these people either. So let me see if I can encourage change in the way we think versus I'm just going to bail and start over with something new. It's I don't know that my faith in Christ was ever challenged in regards to this, but my faith in the church or in Christians are in, it was, it was such a constant. It just feels to me like there's always a new one. There's always a new thing and Christians are habitually and oh, here's the word, predictably responding in an ignorant, graceless, unattractive way. Well can I interrupt? Yes. I found a subreddit. Okay. And man, is it good? We got some gold here. Okay. So the title is what things really grind the gears of the Christians in your life. Oh, nice. Okay. Some of these are pretty lengthy. Yeah. And he goes on this little thing and it's like, it's an, it's an ex-Christian Reddit. So it's like he addresses the ex-Christian fam in his initial thing. Okay. So there's that. And again, I'm not, I'm not condoning any of this, but I think there is, there is some like interest of like, these are actual experiences. Okay. I'm not going to go through all of them. Here's some that stick out that I think we can easily have a conversation about all secular music is bad. Well, except what they like. That's good, but don't call it secular music. How dare you? Okay. So maybe wow, that's definitely the rock and roll. Yep. That's the age. Let's say I had a book entitled the age of rock or the rock of ages. And you have to choose. That was the whole principle of the book is you have to, you have to decide which side you're on the side of the age of rock or the rock. Okay. Here's another one. My mom gets super irritated when someone says X miss instead of Christmas. Yes. That is a brilliant example of Christians foolishly and poorly overreacting to something. The history of the X, because that's the symbol for Christus. That's the, that's the, it's actually the Christian way of saying that is to, is to actually put the X there. That's why it says crossing. Xing is crossing the same concept. Cruse, which means cross or Christ is connected to that. Like it's a, yeah, that's, that's a great one. Thank you. Thank you. No, they're Xing out Christmas. They're Xing out Christ. That's what it means. No. Okay. Go ahead. Gosh. Oh, that's a good one. And just to clarify, we've said this multiple times. We're not making fun of these people. We're laughing at how painfully true these are. Here's something. The X is the chi, the Greek letter chi, which, which is the, the first Greek letter in Christus or Christ in English. So the X in X-mas comes from probably by the way, from that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The Christ mass. I'm curious. I don't, I don't know. This didn't get a whole lot of upvotes. So it's not like, I'm kind of, I'm kind of, I'm kind of weeding through some of these. This one is exercising autonomy. I don't, I don't know that. I don't know if the fact that you're autonomous. Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's several about my father gets ticked. Didn't use that word. When someone says that, that quote, gay people are normal and born that way, or doctors know what they're doing. He's super homophobic, racist, and doesn't trust medicine. Yeah. That's quite a grouping of those. Yeah. Which is interesting. Like is that, is that what is dead? Like it isn't the Christians are the only ones who can overreact. Is the dad saying, no, that's not what he's doing. He's not. He's not. He's not healthy or normal. It's it was, you know, all the history behind that is, is the dad saying just that, which he would have grounds for saying and come having a conversation about does saying that make you hate medicine or distrust medicine? Or is it just, no, no, I disagree with the conclusion. Medical, the medical sciences, the zeitgeist right now. Um, that would be interesting to know. Or is it that he actually, or is he really that way? Yeah. He just, I just hate, I hate everybody. And so, yeah, yes. Somebody telling me otherwise certainly pop. Both are possible. Here's an interesting one. I have a funny story from years ago that I love to tell we were having X miss dinner and a woman was at the table claiming her car burned down, except for this one old book called the Bible. I said, what does that mean to you? That Jesus was watching over my Bible. She replied. So I asked her why her God was so weak. He could barely save an old book from fire, but he can't save millions of kids from starving to death last year. She literally leapt from her seat, grabbed her mother and left. There you go. Yeah. There's the Christian reaction. That's so beautiful. There's an overreaction there. So the, uh, yeah, the Bibles don't burn message. Um, is so I was taught this, I was told the same thing, not taught as in my parents would never have said that, but I was told the same thing. Bibles won't burn without going into detail. I can tell you that that's not true. Um, that individual pages of the Bible burn just fine or rip or rip and tear and all that kind of stuff. But when you have a tight leafed type of pages and you put it in a fire, it typically does not burn very well because there's no oxygen between the pages. And so they created the myth that Bibles don't burn in fires because when a house would burn down, the Bible would typically still be in relatively good shape because it is a leather bound book with lots and lots of pages that are extremely thin paper, you know, not just paper thin, but leaf thin. And so yeah, that was a, I was at a dulcimer Callister event and he had to apologize for the fact that he had set his Bible down on the stage at one point while he was talking. Oh, wow. Instead of setting it on a stand, he said it on the stage. And apparently he was confronted over the mistreatment of the Bible. And I was like, yeah, I have a funny feeling the Bible in your house may not get, it may be just fine on the shelf. It's safe, but like, wow, what a, what a, yeah, like a miss. Are there more on there? Cool. Something that you saw? Oh, nothing do the Christmas one. Get that. It's the rock and roll music. I was raised on that so hard. What are we going? Why are we feeling like this comes from like what, what, why? And I know this, we are not all knowing. However, what do you feel like is one of the several of the catalysts for Christians particularly? I mean, this is not a specifically Christian thing, but I think Christians are called out for it because we hold to a standard and then often don't live according to that standard. So I think a lot of people are quick to call out Christians for this, even though I think a lot of the world is reactionary, but I, but in some sense, I do feel like Christians are more reactionary than others because they hold to a set of standards that often becomes legalism. So maybe I'm answering part of the question, but like, where do you feel like this comes from that Christians in particular seem to be guilty of this? I don't know. I don't know why. Is it because we have the, this kind of persecution complex because we're, we're so ready to be persecuted that it's like everything is persecution. Maybe that's an overreaction that we're so, that's a something we're looking for. We're always on the lookout for where we're being persecuted. And so this is evidence. Maybe it's the, I don't know. I wish I could, I'm working on it here. I'm trying to come up with something. Well, I need that noise where you hit your head on the mic and it makes the high pity noise. I think there, so my ugly answer I wanted to say was I think there's a lot of ignorance. Sometimes that is, I think it comes from that root of faith is believing what you know, ain't so type of faith that like faith is the opposite of knowledge. And if you know something, then that ruins your faith and that you're supposed to hold fast to your faith in spite of all the evidence. And that's what is meant by that. And, and I think as if, as if a psychological state is the, is what's going to save us. And so I just, I don't know. I think that that's part of it. I was raised with some of that, not with my, again, not with my parents, but the first church I went to definitely had that science is the enemy. Like the underlying concepts were incorrect to start with. Yes. And then everything kind of fell into one of those categories. I think another one just like thinking about it in big picture. I think another one is that there's this conversation of, yeah, I think some of it comes from not being well educated in the things of scripture in the world and all of that. But I think there's also a piece of this and y'all can tell me what you think about this, but I think Christians have been taught to, yes, like we are going to be persecuted, but also stand for truth. You're going to be in the world, but not of it. You're going to like all these conversations that are biblical, but then we've taken it and we have made it into something. It's not like we often do and turned it into a legalism and often turned it into a, like, if I give any ground to anyone I view as secular, then I'm compromising my faith. And this is like a generous, this may be a generous understanding of this, because I definitely think there's a lot of sin involved in a lot of reactions from Christians. But I think some of it for people who really love the Lord may be like, hey, I don't want to, you know, like the Halloween conversation or Christmas or whatever. Like, I don't want to give any ground to something that's not truth or something that's quote unquote of the world. And therefore, if I have a nuanced conversation with a nonbeliever, if I say like, oh, this person who, you know, is in a gay relationship is a really kind person and loves their partner well, like that is somehow compromising. Right. And I think that's like a maybe a piece of it for some people of just a misunderstanding of what it means to stand for truth. Well, the the like, there's such a fear of compromise that it turns us into some kind of weird legalist who won't, can't have a conversation anymore. Yeah. It's just a thought. And then I think going from there, then you have different, you know, kind of offshoots of that you have the fair, s\u00e9ical version that's like super prideful. And, you know, people who take pride in their stance and maybe don't even like have a relationship with the Lord, but like their identity is in whatever they've stood by as far as a stance on something. And so it's like, because of pride, I have to just defend my side because that's how we are. I was I was on I lost my train of thought for the other one. But well, okay. So as you were describing that, again, it comes back to one that we hit we have hit so many times over the years of this podcast, and that is bad hermeneutics, right? Right. Is that they're they're taking a stance on tattoos because of a passage in Deuteronomy. Right. And so they're just this massive reaction or gosh, you still hear it today, though, when people make like there's a podcast you and I both listen to periodically that he takes a strong stance against cremation sometimes. Yeah. And tries to make it biblical or a strong, strong stance against gambling of any kind. Yeah. And and again, this is a man who probably has forgotten more about hermeneutics than you or I have ever known. And yet I can hear him making a bad hermeneutical argument about some of these things. Yeah. And so I think that's got to be part of it is that we're just we're just bad at some of this. There's the part of the human nature to react to feel persecuted, to divide into them and us, or them and me or whatever it is. And then take pride on whatever you've decided. Take pride on whatever you've decided. Make that make that your stance. Yeah. And and then invest in it. And then you've got the cognitive dissonance of like, well, my kids have already missed two Halloween's. I must be right about this. Otherwise, I've cheated my kids out of two Halloween's. Yeah. And so right. And so or but we don't go to dances. We don't send our kids to dances because of this. Yeah. And and here's the thing. What's interesting about the compromise question is it's not so in the nuanced conversation like, okay, so the first thing that you said over there with the from the Reddit file was rock and roll music. It's like second music is bad, except for some that I like. Right. Well, that would be a more nuanced conversation. Yeah. To go. Typically, you can't trust secular music to have the right messages. There are some that do have the right messages. Yeah. And those are okay. These would others like that would be the more nuanced. What is actually being promoted here? What's being communicated? And is my child mature enough to engage in that? And so as they get older, yeah, you can watch movies and listen to music that you couldn't when you were younger, because you're more able to go like, well, that's obviously dumb. Like, that's not true. And I'm not going to buy into that or fall into that. But you know, it's got a cool beat. I give it a 48. I think I can dance to a type of thing like that's of course, that becomes more nuanced over time. Yeah. But but I grew up very much so for several years with the if it has a drum beat to it, it's wrong. Yeah. Makes you want to move, which is obviously satanic. Yeah, exactly. Makes you want to move, which of course is going to lead to sex and sexist, evil, impure. And well, back to our previous conversations. Right. Somehow it all comes back to that. Well, I've been on a deep dive over here. Trying to figure out because I think I was like, what are funny, like Ned Flanders things from the Simpsons? Cause you know, the Ned Flanders was this kind of like, I wasn't allowed to watch this. Well, okay. Speaking of, right. Well, I wasn't either. Sorry, dad. Yeah. Yeah. You and I have this vivid memory of my brother and I sit on the sofa and dad walked in and he was like, Hey guys, you really shouldn't be watching that. And he walked out. My brother looked at me and he changed the channel back to the Simpsons. And we just kept watching. That's not good. Anyway, I was just curious if they were like, okay, what were the things that like the Simpsons were pulling out of like, this is, this is good. Here's the thing. I don't have anything like really great. Like there was one that like, he has a, I think a fairly consistent bit where he like, he's always watching them through their window. And then he's like, but Christ is watching you. It's like the, yeah. Like the mantra kind of a deal. Wasn't he also homeschooled? He was a homeschooled Christian. I'm sure. Well, I mean, Milhouse might've been, I don't, I don't know all the characters anyway. So, but I was, so I was like, Oh, is there anything good? And there was really nothing that I came up with right now. But I was like, I was curious what kind of social commentary or social commentators like that were pulling from the culture of this is kind of a hyperbole of what people are. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. Sorry. I don't have anything to reveal. I thought that would reveal some good stuff. Well, okay. So I have another thought. Okay. So when it comes to like the psychological aspect of this, did you just have it? Keep going. But I thought of another one. Okay. When it comes to the psychological aspect of this, I think this, your comment about cognitive dissonance brought this up. I think we have to we are so bad about this as humans, but we have to, even as Christians understand that there are things at play like cognitive dissonance where it's like, no, this is like intellectually painful for me to admit that I was wrong because of all the things that that means. That doesn't mean I wasn't wrong. And also as humans, we get addicted to behaviors that we, like emotions that we lean into a lot, I think. For sure. And so like a dick, you know, being addicted to outrage and anger as a response is like, if that's something that you train your brain to do a lot, we all see these people on social media where it's like, wow, there's a lot of anger built up in you that I've never even seen in person, but it's coming out on your Facebook. And it's like, I think even as Christians, we can start out with that, like, oh, well, I'm just standing for truth, or I'm just like holding the line or whatever it is. And then even if that was initially true, we can get addicted to anger and outrage. And then all of our behaviors are not following the way of Christ. And I think culture sees that as hypocritical. Like that is why it is interesting, makes the news a lot faster when Christians do things like that, because it's like, wow, this is not what you teach. And yet look how you're acting. But yeah, I think the intellectual like, or the, the psychological aspect of it is something that we have to talk about. Like, yeah, am I training my brain to be negative every day? Like, am I looking for things? Like, am I addicted to being angry about stuff? Am I a product of my algorithm? Wow. Because of my own algorithm. That's not wrong. Yeah. So that's the thought I had. That's really good. The example that struck me that I've run into, and maybe, maybe non-Christians or deconstructors don't see this as often, but I do. And so they must see it, at least on my side, on my, is the overreaction to current events as being a sign of the apocalypse. And that is a, that to me is something that I have to, I feel like I have to roll my eyes at all the time. Yeah. That I'm like, Oh gosh, we're it's, Oh, there's another red heifer, or there's another red moon, or there's another something. And this is, this one's it. This, listen, this is, and of course, as a Bible believer, I believe eventually one of them will be it. But yeah, the thought that we need to again, be humble in saying, yeah, this could be it. Someday he comes back. But to think every time there's a rattle in Abraham, in Iran, that's it. Or there's a rattle in Israel, you know, to react that way. Yeah. And there was some crazy overreaction fairly recently. I saw somebody post something on Facebook about why like it was the title of the post was essentially like, why Donald Trump is not the beast there, you know, and it was wounded in the head. And that's it right there, baby. But and like what he said was this, why this is not and the vitriol that kind of just came in the comments. I was like, Whoa. Yes, it was, it was like, it was crazy. And so I was like, I don't know. Yeah, it is a I would love to really encourage, like, please, Christians out there when we see something that we want to react with fear, or with immediate persecution response or whatever. It isn't that we may be right or wrong about some of these things when new research comes out. And we go, Oh, now again, this is a human thing. When research comes out that says, Hey, you know, there may be a genetic predisposition for attraction. Don't overreact. Listen, that's part of our tenants of Christianity is that all of us are born sinful. And somehow that's not the one magic sin no one could be born with a predisposition for welcome to the human race. But if you're going to do that, you know, if you're going to immediately react, then when like the cast review just came out saying, it turns out that maybe transgender treatment, affirming treatments to children actually do more harm than good almost universally. Well, then why are we suddenly a big fan of that? It was like, Oh, it turns out, almost all humans like research that backs what they already believe. And we try to throw out the relationship that the any type of research that doesn't back what we already believe. And how cool if Christians were the ones who are able to do that well to go, Oh, I need to, I'm going to have to think about this. So which I think will make us so much more winsome to culture. So I think what I'm like hearing from all of our conversation is like, first of all, take a breath. Like you don't have to immediately respond. Yes, please. Like just maybe sit for a minute. Yeah. And then also, yeah, just like, regardless of what it is, respond in the way of Jesus, because responding lovingly is not compromised. Like responding with kindness or hearing someone's side or hearing like other opinions that you disagree with is like not the same as compromising truth. And, and on the contrary, when you are having those conversations, we'll make it where you can be heard more clearly. Yes. So anything else I would add, please take your time, be humble and listen. And I make sure you understand what people are coming from. And then, then craft a response that would be thoughtful, indicate a certain level of preparation and intelligence and sophistication. Again, we don't compromise. We're allowed to take stands and hold to them, but we want that to be done humbly and intelligently. Come let us reason together. And I think that's where we want to come at this. So this is good. It's, this has been therapeutic for me, if nothing else, to be able to unpack some of these. Thank you for finding them. Our bill Halloween ones and the, that's pretty good. Those are some good stuff. And by the way, we do have other material. We've talked about some of these on other podcasts. Totally. Look those, if you're like, what, but what about Halloween? I didn't say enough. Like it's, and by the way, you probably didn't say it that way. That's me doing my Christian response voice again. Sorry. Look it up and check it out. And we'd love to follow up on any of that. We'll, we'll happily talk about any of these things more. So thanks guys. I love it.
