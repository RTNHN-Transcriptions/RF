We hope to dive into the hard conversations of life and faith and seek out reasonable, substantive answers. My name is Colson Lechner and I am joined by Chris Sherrod, Chris Legg, and Bryn Starnes. This is Reconstructed Faith. Hey there, Colson Lechner here. Before we roll this next episode, I just want to provide a quick preface by saying that the following content, while not derogatory or inappropriate, is intended for adult listeners concerning the topic of sex and sexuality in the Bible. So obviously use your own discretion and we hope you enjoy the conversation. Thanks again for listening and here we go. All right, well, welcome back to the Reconstructed Faith podcast. My name is Colson Lechner alongside my partners in crime, Chris Legg and Bryn Starnes in studio. Here's Chris Sherrod as well. Guys, it's good to be back. I'm glad that we're back together. Bryn is back from her travels. Although my only complaint is that everyone keeps calling it a baby moon, which is so weird since I took my siblings along. It's like, oh, you took your siblings on your honeymoon? What? Yeah. Your mom actually. It was a pre-baby trip. I know. Your mom came up to me the other night at a youth group and she said, Hey, I just want you to know, Bryn, Bryn did tell me to tell you, it's not a baby. I said, Oh, I know. I said, that's why we're calling it a baby. Exactly. Right. Why else would we? Right? Yeah. But you had a good time. Oh, it was so fun. Yeah. Lots of national parks and mountains. So it was beautiful. So cool. Very good. Did you end up going white water rafting or no? I chose not to. Way to go. Far enough along where it probably wasn't the best decision, but I did do some hikes. So that was fun. Wonderful. Yeah. But just decided to read a book during the white water rafting for, forget, probably a better decision. But you might be, the good news is you might be more buoyant than you've ever been in your entire life. That's probably true. A higher chance of survival. Well, we're glad that you're back and we're going to continue on with kind of our stepping into what the Bible talks about with around sexuality. Yep. And we know that there's going to be a lot of like tangents that kind of come off of this kind of central topic. But where we wanted to go today was we talked a little bit about a general overview of sexuality, what the Bible says about sexuality. How is that defined in the Bible? Especially Hebrew scriptures. Exactly. And so we foundations. Exactly. And then so I think it would be good for us to move into the New Testament. That's what right now we're talking about now. And what Jesus talked about. And then we can kind of move on from there. And Paul and other writers in the New Testament. Yes. That's a great idea. Again, we're kind of going through the season of is the Bible immoral by today's standards. Right. And I think we all kind of realized altogether kind of at the same time what that meant in some areas. So we were having fun with all the areas like racism and sexism and slavery and even genocide that that's kind of like really probably not that the Bible and most of our modern thinking are more closely aligned than people would realize about those topics. We just it's been abused or misused or whatever. And now we're moving into sex as a topic and sexual sin and sexual and and yeah, it's just such a great reminder that we live in a culture where it's so built on Freudian thought that that sex is the root of human value and human happiness that yes, yeah, we're running into. Yeah, there's going to be some things that that the Bible teaches about sex that definitely fly in the face of the kind of limitless sexual expression and limitless sexual freedom that yeah, that our culture does embrace and finds offensive. You know, any anything that is is says the other perspective. So, yeah, and then when you go, and then what but it's interesting then when you follow what the Bible says, how it is actually how we were created to be. That's where we see relationships flourishing, you know, families flourishing and stuff like that. Yeah, it's it's tough. It's it's because people will, it's hard for people to accept some of those things. Understandable. It's hard to accept. It's hard to accept that anything I was teaching a group of students this week. And and I threw out the question, which you guys have heard some of you've heard me do, but I threw out the first question, what does it mean to be a slave? And we talked about this. And the answer was, you have to do what somebody else says. And I said, Well, what is freedom? And the definition that immediately came out was that you get to do whatever you want. I said, so so slavery is you have to do what somebody else wants. And freedom is I get to do whatever I want. And so we're literally defining freedom in terms of slavery to self. And that will only work out if you're a good slave master. And if you're really good at being a slave master, then maybe it makes sense to be a slave to yourself. But if you suspect that you would be a self absorbed, hypercritical, perfectionistic, out of control, you know, picket, egotistical slave master. That applies to you too, to you being your own slave master. And it just struck me as how dangerous it is that we're teaching everybody. Not only are you your own slave master, but you're your own definer, you're your own designer, you're your own describer, like there's nothing else. And wow. Well, and even that is so many times when we are a slave to ourselves, it's a slave to even one part of ourselves. So it's our sexuality, our stomach or whatever it is. And so even that is like a loose definition of that's a great point. Kind of a civil war. Yeah. Any thoughts shared? Well, I think we've talked before about the rise in triumph in the modern self. The new, I guess it's probably a couple of years old now, the Carl Truman book. But I came across a quote that I had shared this last summer at family camp. Are you guys okay if I read a quote? Go for it. Kind of extended quote. It really summarizes a lot of what we're about to talk about and why this is so volatile. And so well, mainly, mainly volatile because people and why people take it so personal. Here's what he says. He's talking about how we got where we're at today. And he's already talked about the history with Freud and other people before him. But he says the self was psychologized. Psychology was then sexualized. And finally, sex was politicized. Interesting. Yeah. And then he says the stage was set for the contemporary politics of sexual identity. Of course, few people read Reich and Marcus, let alone Rousseau and de Sade, but the idea, here's the main point that I was going to say. The idea that happiness is personal psychological satisfaction or self-fulfillment is the staple of sitcom soap operas, movies, and even commercials. In this narrative, this illusion has powerful implications. When the goal of human existence is personal psychological satisfaction, then all moral codes are really instrumental and therefore continually revisable to this subjective psychological end. And then he ends with kind of where we're at. He says that society seems to have decided that A, perhaps the major way to achieve this is sex means that any attempt to enforce a code of sexual behavior is an assault on the individual. It means whereby individuals are forced to be inauthentic and indeed unhappy. And anyone who therefore tries to enforce sexual codes as oppressive or a hater to use the cheap and lazy means of delegitimizing any critic of the moral mess that is late modernity. I just thought that was an overall good explanation of why when we just talk about moral behavior, people take it as a personal attack on them. It's because that's such a central part of their identity because it has to do with I'm maybe unsatisfied or self-fulfillment or whatever that. Anyways, that's why it becomes so volatile and yeah, such a divisive issue. Yeah, that's really good. That's a great reminder. And I think we've said this before too, but for people who want a summary of the rise and triumph of the modern self, he wrote the abridged version recently, which is a strange new world. Strange new world. It's much less intimidating. Yeah, man. That's really good. That's good for us to have that. I would encourage that anyone to read that. I think that's a it's a good understanding of the pattern. And is that like a social commentary? Is that how you would categorize that book? I think that's fair. Yeah, he starts out with the phrase, I am a man trapped in a woman's body. And he says, is this a Christian? Is he a Christian author? He is a believer, but I don't think the book isn't necessarily. Okay. I'm early. It's just kind of tracing where they're at. But okay. What he talks about is that statement would have not made sense to like our grandparents. Like that the statement, I'm a woman trapped in a man's body. Right. Would have just sounded like nonsense. Because it used to be you change your, your psychology, your way of thinking to match your body. Now it's you change your body to measure, you know, your psychology. But he does a really good job just talking about in general, I was really convicted where he says, if you had asked your grandfather or great grandfather, is your job fulfilling to you? He would have looked puzzled. Like he would have given you this weird look like what, what do you mean is my job? Like, do you find fulfillment in your job? Like that just doesn't make, that isn't registered in my family and my faith. And those are where we find fulfillment. Right. He'd be more like, I'm providing, like I'm, I'm doing, you know, a good work with my hands or something, but not, you know, do you even in Chris, you'd appreciate the part he talks about even the role of counselors is not to help someone now figure out why and how they can best fit into society. It's to affirm that, no, you're right. And everybody else is wrong. And right. They all have the problem. And it's just, it's not actually helping someone cope with reality. Yes. That actually is a, is an issue we face in the therapeutic world right now. Big time is, is the, is the only job of a therapist to affirm. And my opinion is that with good therapists, the answer is no, it's not your job to affirm. If all they need was affirmation, they don't need you. Yeah. They could probably affirm themselves. Most people now, affirmation is a healthy part of a healthy relationship, but it's not the whole relationship. Right. I'm curious. This is kind of a tangent, but you had mentioned having like some universities not allow people to come and do kind of their master's level hours at your office. Is that a reason? Because you probably wouldn't be affirming those in those ways. Not automatically affirming and of whatever the person's lifestyle is. And that's, by the way, that's true of any, in my opinion of any good therapy is part of the job of a therapist is to help you question your life decisions, not to just affirm them. Right. No matter what they are. And so anyway, that's a, that's what we're seeing, but we're seeing this more and more and you're now, you're feeling the ramifications in your business. Oh, absolutely. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's happening for sure. Even a tenant of good community, like good community of saying like, Hey, if I don't want my friends just to affirm everything that I do, right? Like if, if they truly care about me to the point where they're willing to be like courageous and, and loving to the point where it's difficult, uncomfortable, like I would want them to ask me really hard questions. And yet we're, we're seeing that community is equated with the same type of approval. I think that's right. And then everything else is a question. And that's perfect because as we continue our conversation about what the Bible teaches about sex, what God has revealed through his word about sex, it's not going to be affirming. Right. It's not going to be all affirm. It's going to be extremely affirming. God is very pro sex in the marriage covenant. Would you say it's limiting? It is not, it is very anti-sex outside of that marriage covenant. It's not even limiting. It is forbidden. Yeah. Like it is, it is, is a clear line in the sand of inside of marriage. Actually, what I tell premarital couples is, as a, as a couple who isn't, who isn't in that covenant relationship, purity is experienced essentially by keeping your hands off each other. I don't mean that literally, but sexually. And that very same purity after the covenant has been initiated is expressed with essentially no holds barred. That it's, it goes from one extreme to the other. And, and that is a, and that's clearly defined. I think so. In the Bible. So if we're jumping now into more of that, okay, what does the New Testament say about this? Where does your brain go to, or both of y'all, all of you, where does, where do your thoughts go? And how, yeah, how can we answer that question of what does the New Testament say? Because my brain, I automatically go to 1st Corinthians six. Okay. But, but I was like, but then we back it up and you've got Jesus. I think to me, the most helpful one even is Jesus. Well, on the, on the negative side and then on the affirmative side and the negative side, you've got him explaining even just marriage is such a beautiful, precious, awesome thing that you've got to guard it even from lustful thoughts. So Matthew five, where he's talking about, you know, you've heard it said, don't commit adultery. And you can check that box and just go, I have not physically had sex with someone who was not my spouse. But then he goes even deeper and he actually raises. This is what I think is interesting. He raises the moral bar even higher. Yep. It says it's not just that you haven't physically done it, but it's what's going on in your heart. What's going on in your thoughts. And you're looking at someone with lustful thoughts and you know, fantasizing or thinking about it and it's not your spouse, then it's your sitting. So I think he's, he's talking about a sin there. But then he talks about how the, how crucial it is to guard your thoughts. And then he talks about really what you're saying, Chris, is that you've got to take drastic measures, right? Whether it's equivalent to not that you have to go cut your eye out or cut your arm off, but equivalent to man, this is such a big deal. I need to do whatever it takes to be, you know, safe in this area and to guard it. So that's where he says, you know, if you're right, I cause you to sin, we'll gouge it out. I've never only sinned with one eye, but But if you knew you had to literally do that, you might protect one of your eyes at all times to make sure. Right. And we do know, obviously, Jesus is speaking in hyperbole there, or is teaching a lesson because his followers didn't all immediately start cutting off hands and poking out eyes. Like they understood him in the moment. Later, actually, some early church followers took him much more seriously. There were, there were first and second and third generation Christians who turned themselves into eunuchs, for example, in an effort to avoid lust and sexual sin. I mean, you have to admire their dedication. Even if they, their interpretation, I think they're hermeneutics maybe, but hermeneutics, once again, are very important. We've talked about making some apparel that I feel like we would have to stray from that. Yes, exactly. But anyway, anyway, so, okay, that's good. So Matthew chapter five. Yep. And that's, that's in the middle and the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount. And even there, the Greek there, he divides out different Greek words. Porneo, that Greek word, meaning any type of sexual sin. What verse is that in? I know we've talked about it before. We're in, I'm starting in, I'm in 27 right now. Matthew five. So he has the word for adultery, which, which it's, it's application is a little tough. It certainly means two people who aren't married to each other having sex or couldn't, sorry, it could mean that any situation in which two people not married to each other have sex. It certainly means two people, at least one of whom is married, having sex with someone other than their spouse. Those may sound identical, but there's, there's debate over whether this word adultery would apply to say, for example, premarital sex, but two people who neither who are married, would this word apply to them? And there's debate about that. And there's plenty of other passages that would include that. It's just whether this word would. Yeah. Porneo comes in. Porneo is any sexual immorality, which certainly includes sex with someone you're not married to. And whereas this, I can't pronounce the Greek word for adultery. It's a tough word to pronounce, and I'm not good at pronouncing Greek, but muy casais, muy casais, anyway. But, which means married people having sex with someone other than the person they're married to. Okay. Anyway. And Jesus here may be using them almost interchangeably, but then he uses that word, kind of epithymus, that word for heat, steam, passion, lust. And that's why it's often translated lustful intent, epi, like a epidural, something that really dives into like the depth of lustful intent. So this isn't Jesus condemning finding someone attractive or saying, man, he's cute, or man, she's hot, or something like that. Like that's not, he's not condemning just baseline attraction here, who you find attractive and who you don't. It's a mental decision to pursue that, to pursue those attractives, attractions, even if it's only pursued internally. That would still fall into that. And Jesus, as I had one, one of my pastors say, Jesus is not impressed by your lack of opportunity or your lack of courage. And so if the only reason you're not trying to have sex with somebody is because you're either afraid of the consequences, which, you know, because you're just not brave enough, or because you don't think you have a shot with that person, you just don't have the opportunity. Neither one of those impress him. And I think I've even heard you say like, well, if I wasn't married, I would do, you know, that kind of, yeah, that's dangerous. If there was no barrier here, then I would, it's like, you might want to, you're not in the right spot. Yeah, you're not in the right spot. That's right. It's a if I could, I would language is probably the internal process. And it certainly would include things like fantasy and, and that kind of stuff. And probably pornography could easily fall into that, even though it does obviously fall into porno. There, you know, the word is there. But so it is intriguing that we start as Chris just showed us, what we start with is God's standard for sex, kind of being for all of us. Right? I mean, for everybody, no matter what your attractions are, no matter what your self perception is, no matter what, Jesus starts by protecting sex at the thought level first, which is very similar, obviously, to the Ten Commandments, which is the last of the commandments is a thought level protection. Go ahead, Chris. And I was gonna add, too, I think, obviously, Jesus is saying sexual integrity is so precious that it's not even violated in the privacy of your mind. Yeah, but I would add also, it is also valuing the woman being less than after it's saying she she's precious. And whether or not she knows you ever looked at her that way, or thought about her that way. I want to protect her integrity as well, and not have you walking around thinking this isn't affecting anyone, like he wants to guard against her being looked at that way. Because again, if she knew that you were thinking of those thoughts, she would feel wronged or violated or something like that. So in this, it's not just your thoughts between you and God, it's also, hey, I want to protect her being looked at in a less full way, too. And we know that those thoughts and repeated, as well as with porn stuff, can devalue, dehumanize people in the male brain. Well, and the female brain. Yeah, definitely. It works on the human brain that way. Maybe more quickly or more universally with the male brain. But honestly, it has that has those damaging effects. But we know that scientifically. It's not just like, oh, we think this is the case. Like, no, this is it has this effect. If anybody wants to learn a little bit about it from the purely secular perspective, there are now more and more TED talks being created, because the culture is scrambling to try to figure out what to do about pornography. And they don't have tools to deal with pornography, because so many of us are addicted to it. And the modern version is so addictive. And it's a huge industry now, you know, billions, it has been a long time, but it can just continues to grow massive, massive, most that the pornography line here is now it's going to be bigger than most national national budgets. Wow. I don't know the number now, but I remember it's like way back in 06 that it crossed the line where the pornography industry represented more money than like all of the professional leagues combined NFL, baseball, all of them combined. Yeah, combined. And it was more than that. Somebody quoted me a statistic, you see the day that something the area $4,000 was it I think it made $4,000 a second. Is spent on pornography. Oh, my goodness. So it's a and consider how much pornography is free. And then consider the $4,000. I don't know. And it may, you know, I need to probably look that up because it could be as much as 60 times. It could be as much as 4,000 a minute. I don't remember the number I was told, but I don't have to look that up. But it was either one is a shockingly high number that you don't even know what to do with in your brain. Yeah. Anyway, so that I mean, our culture is so blind to the connection between the demand that pornography creates and sex trafficking today. Oh, yeah. Like everyone's all against sex trafficking. Like they they would say that's wrong, but they don't understand. Okay, but what's feeding it in a major way, the pornography, the sensuality, all this stuff going on in our culture is driving that and feeding it. And it's like, it's like the what's where you cut off the head and other three grow. It's the Hydra. Yeah, the Hydra. Yep. Well, I think it's trying to stop that. But it's I think it's easier to turn an eye because so many people are users or addicted to it. And if if you admit the connection, then you have to address the first part of it. Yeah. And that's further than most people are ready to go to. That's a good point. Yeah. Would you when it comes to the word for porn? Oh, would you say that Jesus's contemporaries understood that he was referencing? So I know in the last episode, you guys talked about in the Old Testament, like what all would fall under that. And, and then that would anything that would fall under the word porn? Oh, when Jesus uses it, his contemporaries would understand like all the different aspects of that that were mentioned in the Old Testament. Do you think that's accurate? Yeah, I do. I think because that would have been so in the Septuagint, the Septuagint, which was the Greek copy of the Old Testament, or the Greek copy of Hebrew Scripture, which is the copy many, many would have been reading in the time of Jesus, like when the Apostle Paul quotes Hebrew Scripture, he quotes the Septuagint. Yeah. And so we know that's what most of them are seeing. And unless I am gravely mistaken, I feel confident about this, that each of those times in Leviticus 18, that we see the the words for sexual immorality, it is the word porneo. In the when in the Greek copy, it is porneo. And there's a chance I'm off on that. But I don't think so. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what's being the Greek word that's used there. And so yes, when Jesus says sexual immorality, when he uses when he uses whatever Aramaic word that we assume he was speaking most of the time, that his followers translated into the Greek word porneo, everyone listening would have known he was referencing those five plus issues listed in Leviticus. So when people say Jesus didn't reference certain types of sexual expression, that's not accurate. That would be like if we if I said, hey, don't know, we're not going to eat any more donuts. And later, when someone's eating a chocolate filled donut, and they go, well, you didn't say chocolate filled. Well, I don't I don't need to ask at all donuts. Right. And so to say, well, Jesus didn't reference that one sexual morality. No, he didn't need to. He referenced all sexual morality. And so whatever those one different examples are, that would those would be included in that. Okay, so just love that your mind automatically goes to donuts. It's not like I mean, I have more than one addiction and sugar is one. Pornography is another one. And that's a like, those are, yeah, those are very real and very powerful. This is another one of those examples I talked about last time about erotic and intimate and illicit expressions of sexuality where God's what we're learning is that God's pattern for this is better. It's better for a culture is better for a society is better for marriage is better for personal health. And it is sad and intriguing when we see for example, when I've watched several of these TED talks and watching these totally secular people who don't know what the Bible teaches about these things coming out and saying, man, this is this is destroying a generation, especially of young men, what do we do? Like, because we can't tell them to stop. Because that would be limiting their sexual freedom. So since that's not an option, now, what do we do? And it's just it's, again, God's answer of no, stop. Trust me that I know what I'm talking about. And we're all terrible at it. I'm terrible at it. And so trust me, trust me, that I know what I'm talking about. And I don't believe him. They knows what he's talking about either a lot of the time. But yeah, that doesn't mean he doesn't. Okay, for Matt, good. Sorry, this might have been an irreversible damage, or I might have been thinking of something else. I don't know. But if you'll help me remember, but just there was a short brief story about a teenage boy having sex with his girlfriend, he's like a young guy, probably 13 years old, and he starts choking her. Yeah, I remember that. She's like, what is that in the book? You know what I'm talking about? She's like, what? And he's like, I thought that's what you I thought that's what you do. Is that not what girls like, right? Like, he had learned that and that was in his brain. So I'm just thinking of the train wreck, Chris, you're talking about like, they don't want to do, I'm just thinking of the train wreck that this is going to leave on on girls, not just the the obvious sex trafficking, but just wives and women feeling abused and and seen as you know, just stories of boyfriends, wedding girls, their girlfriends watch porn with them. Yeah. And just it's just gonna lead to just more and more just brokenness. Well, there's never an end to it. It's a, you know, ravenous. Yeah. So moving on from Matthew, chapter five, then what are other things that come to your mind in this conversation? Well, I think the next one that jumps out to me is, is then Matthew 19. Is there something between those? Nope, I had another one in Mark, but that it's Matthew, if we're going to chronological, I was going to say 19 as well. Okay. So in Matthew 19, um, in verse three, the Pharisees came up to him testing him and said, is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause? And which is apparently a big rabbinical question in the time of Jesus is under what conditions could was a man justified before God to divorce his wife. And there was a huge debate over these extreme examples. And is it as much as like, well, she burned the toast. So that's impurity. So I can divorce her all the way. And then Jesus gives the other extreme answer, by the way. And he answered, have you not read that he who created them from the beginning, made them male and female and said, therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh. So they're no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. Um, so it's Jesus then in this moment combines a verse from chapter one of Genesis and a verse from chapter two of Genesis. And he puts them together to define marriage. And, and the joining together, we'll learn from Paul's writing that the joining together of two to become one flesh, a major physical representation of that is sex. Paul's going to reference not joining yourself to a prostitute, for example. So there's something powerful about the sexual encounter that's adjoining power. But in this conversation, one of the things that we have to talk through is Jesus seems to be offering a pretty clear definition, a pretty clear, he is making a clarification here. It's not he, this is, this would be the time for Jesus to clarify things about marriage, what all applies to marriage, what all does marriage include, what all and what he gives a very limiting answer, like under what conditions is divorce acceptable. And, and essentially his initial answer is none under no, now he has already said way back in chapter five that, that adult, that sexual immorality is the only time that it would be excusable. And but here he's, he offers up just what God has joined together, let no man separate. And it's a, it's a powerful picture. What you would be stuck with very quickly here is when he says therefore, so here's the definition of marriage, marriage is a man leaving his father and mother and being bonded to his wife. And that's the idea here is he's leaving them that he now has a new covenant relationship, a new prioritization with her that is over them. This is now his top relationship on earth and the two become one flesh and, and stay that way. Like that's the, and then when I asked about divorce, he's talked about the hardness of heart is their problem. Because of the hardness of your heart, Moses verse eight, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery. And so again, there's a covenant there that that adultery is the breach of that covenant. Sexual immorality is the breach of that covenant. And, and a conversation I've been having with somebody is on this question on verse five. Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and that he shall become one flesh. And immediately the question has to be asked how many different, how many different words can you put in place of man and wife? How many are allowed? So by a man leaving his father and mother, so a man shall hold fast to his wife. So under the word wife, can you put husband? Can you put sibling? Can you put tree? Can you put pet? Can you put in what all can you put there? And how many different words can the word wife mean? Because Jesus seems to be very much so clarifying this, this is it. It's just this. And you have to make the case, therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his husband, that Jesus meant that too by the word wife. And the Greek word here is gynae, which means female. It's actually the Greek word for female. And so obviously, that's a great limiter. Marriage includes this. That's why you often see, I remember when Dr. Craig, William Lane Craig was asked the first time about gay people, he said that somebody asked him like, why do you think gay people can't be married? And I don't know if he was playing dumb, or if he was just making a point or whatever. The question asker. No, no, no, the question asker asked the answer that Dr. Craig gave was, well, gay people can be married. Of course, gay people can, they have the same rights to be married as anybody else. They just, I mean, they have to be married to the opposite sex. So if what you mean, what you mean to say is same sex marriage, whatever your attractions are, you have the same rights to be married as anybody else. Marriage just means a man and a woman. So the word means, therefore, sure, a gay man can marry a woman, no doubt. That's because that's what marriage means. And that was the whole argument made from the beginning that he made. And that's, you know, that's obviously that's a difference between the Bible and the United States. Now is that Bible has a clear definition of marriage that is between a man and a woman. And then the US government has decided it can include any number of other populations as well. And so it isn't that we're defying one or the other, we're just saying they are not in agreement. They don't define marriage the same way. The US government and Jesus Christ do not define, unless you want to make the case that Jesus teaching here is not specific. That when he says a man holds fast to a woman, that that's marriage. That by that Jesus meant a man holds fast to a man or a woman holds fast to a woman, or an adult holds fast to a child, or a human holds fast to a dolphin, like whatever, or to themselves, that's coming a common one. Like a man shall hold fast to himself, that that would apply. Unless you want to try to make that case, you're stuck saying, okay, this marriage over here is a, it's a civil marriage, it's just not a biblical marriage. And what we're saying is hermeneutically, we can't make that leap. I can't make that leap. I can't see how you possibly can defend that well. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. I think even just how offensive Jesus' words will be today that God made the male and female. It's binary. There's two options. And this is thousands of years after Genesis. And so it's the same thing today. Like I'm going to follow Jesus pattern. I'm going to go back to the original intent. And I think from, if I were to narrow down, I think it was in the book, I was reading the book, God and the transgender debate. I think it was in there where he talks about if you're going to narrow this passage down or narrow the definition of marriage down to three words, it would be heterosexual, monogamous, and permanent. Like that's, that's to summarize what Jesus is saying. It's heterosexual. So opposite gender, it's monogamous. That's the only other person and it's permanent. I heard someone say one time wedlock, wedlock should be a padlock. But anyways, that, that really narrows it down to the specifics. And as we've been talking about, again, it's the same thing of it is not in any intent to hinder or limit or ruin someone's fun or enjoyment. It's to enhance it. It's because God is pro sex. And once you do experience the joy of a relationship, that's you're not comparing yourself to anybody else, or you understand we're in this for life, or he, he wants you to have this flourishing experience. And so he says, that's why it's got to be heterosexual, monogamous, and permanent. And when we don't see, and we, and when we don't see God as the designer and definer of things, and it's rather for us to decide, it makes sense that it would, that would seem limiting and oppressive. From a cultural perspective. Yeah. And I think also it goes back to a difference of goal of sexuality, because, like we're talking about with culture, if everything is for my happiness and my fulfillment and my instant gratification of whatever I define that to be, then, you know, in the end, like God's goal for marriage isn't those things, you know, happiness isn't the ultimate goal for marriage. And so I think there's even a contradicting of goals where it's like, yeah, I mean, this definition does require a lot of things that are counter cultural when it comes to self sacrifice and, and I'm magnifying of the picture of Christ in the top of the world. And I think magnifying of the picture of Christ in the church and, and laying down of a lot of my instant wants and wishes, which, which is counter cultural and isn't, isn't leading to fulfillment in that sense. Right. I mean, well, I keep in mind that that's a good point, because the, the Western culture right now is not on the same page with biblical culture, right? And I don't mean Jewish culture, I mean, kingdom culture, what, what the Bible is teaching ought to be the culture of man. They aren't in alignment. And so again, we're just accepting, we're starting this part of the conversation with that in place. Self fulfillment is not the primary goal of the kingdom. Self sacrifice is the primary goal of the kingdom mindset. And so, yeah, it's, if you start with the idea that my goal is to somehow maybe sacrifice myself for the cause of the kingdom, just saying no to sexual partners seems like a relatively low price relative to the ultimate price I've already signed off for. Right. That's good. But I think it's an important thing to, to acknowledge because sometimes I think it's easy for Christians to try, we, we fall into the trap of trying to sell the Christian sexual ethic as like, no, but you'll be happier this way. And it's like, that's not necessarily true. Like if you're trying to, depending on what your specific happiness and what your specific like attraction is and what your specific, like all these different things about individuals, if you're trying to sell a Christian ethic to them as like, no. And yes, we do believe that God knows best and knows what leads to our, our ultimate like fulfillment in him. But I think we have to be careful when we're trying to talk to others about the Christian sexual ethic that we don't make it a prosperity gospel of, that's an excellent point. You know, a prosperity sexual gospel. Yeah. But anyway, I think that's good. That's, that's well said. And a good reminder. There's that that's not his ultimate promise is that we'll be sexually fulfilled. Right. Right. A great, a great analogy. I made a great picture of that would be if I'm covenanted to my wife and she is then in an accident and for some reason could not engage sexually. You, you, that is not an excuse or a justification for divorce. Because that's not the primary goal. It is, it is a typically a very healthy part of the marriage because God designs it, but it's not a, it's not the end all be all. But our culture has made it that. Absolutely. Yeah. It is the end all be of all human happiness. Yeah. It's the only source. I was, I was stunned. I mean, I'm a psychologist and I've read Freud and to go back and reread some of Freud's philosophical statements about sex and realizing how much we have fully accepted his, his standards for that was, was impressive for me. All right, Chris, you were to jump on over to Mark. Yeah. The other one that came to my mind was in Mark seven, when Jesus was dealing on one of many occasions with traditions and commandments and things like that. And his disciples weren't washing their hands like they're supposed to and doing other things. And he explains to everybody that the issue is not what's going into you. It's what's coming out of you. And he just talks about ultimately the heart. So in, so that's the context. Yeah, I'll just pick up in verse 20. This is Mark seven. And he said, what comes out of a person is what defiles him for from within out of the heart of man come evil thoughts, sick sexual morality. So there's a perneo, theft, murder, adultery, coveting wickedness, deceit, sensuality, evil slander, pride, foolishness, all these evil things come from within and they defile a person. And the reason I would go to that is it's because of what, what we just already said is it's sex isn't bad. It's God's not it up. But there really are a lot of people who, and I don't know if girls struggle with this more than guys who have really been really, really focused on staying sexually pure that end up thinking of sex as a bad thing almost even after you get married, that it becomes a struggle like all that because, and again, I think it's how your, your parents framed it and explaining it to you that it's such a dirty, awful, gross thing you'd never want to do. And then, oh, now you're married. And then having that mental shift of when I thought this is a gross, dirty, awful thing. So I think it's parents job to explain the beauty of it and God's design of it. And then the problem is that we're, we're the ones who ruin it. We're the ones, and this is bringing me back to Mark seven that Jesus says the issue is our hearts, our hearts are the ones that twist it and get focused on sensuality or sexual morality or adultery. Sex itself isn't bad. Right. I think that's a great point. I think there's a lot of, and I've talked to a lot of, um, and maybe it is specifically women, but that's just who I've talked to more about this appropriately, you know, but, uh, but I think you're right that it's, and I know it's a really difficult line to walk for parents to teach. How do you teach that God made sex beautiful, but like, don't do it now. You know, like that's, but I think there's a lot of shame that is placed on sex in general instead of just an inappropriate expression of it. And so it does carry over into a healthy or biblical marriage, because instead of teaching sex from a healthy standpoint of like, Hey, this is beautiful and was designed by God. Um, like we've talked about before, it's not something man discovered behind God's back. I think that does end up affecting women at least once they get married and then they can't disassociate it from shame in general. Yeah. It's okay. So the way here's, I actually just got to teach this too, to those students. Um, it's different to teach nowadays. Like I had one at three 30 minute chapels and the last one I wanted to tell them, this is who God says you are, but they're not going to listen to me if I just start with that. Who cares what God says I am. And so I have to spend an hour, two 30 minute sessions before teaching them. There is such a thing as truth and there is such a thing as bestowed identity and it's better than the identity we give ourselves. Now here's what God says about you. Like I have to work my way there nowadays. And so, um, but one of the ways I showed them was the way I showed it at church, which, which is what is sacred versus common versus trash. And so the, the, the world began to teach that sex was common and that was part of the sexual revolution. It's not special. It's just something everybody does animals do it. People do it. Everybody does it. It's nothing special. It's just something things that people do. And, and sadly, in many cases, the church's response was to, was to say, no, it's not common. It's trash. And so I bring three plates in and, and I brought in a paper plate and an everyday plastic plate. And then one of my wife's, hopefully she doesn't listen to this in here, that I took one of her grandmother's pieces of bone China down to Houston to teach this. Um, I told the kids, I was like, do not let her know that I brought this down here. But, but so, you know, I'm teaching it and I just tossed the paper plate. I'm like, it's trash. And that's sadly what often we're taught is sex is trash. Like get as far from you as possible. Flea from sex instead of flee from sexual morality, it's flee from sex and it's bad. And it's, and so we throw it away. Like, yeah, it's worthless. And then common is the everyday. Like this is where you have mac and cheese. Like it's not special. It's just, you know, it's just common. If it, if it does break, who cares? It's, you know, they cost 99 cents of Walmart or what, you know, and so that I throw it out there and it doesn't, it didn't break. If it had him again, the point was, it doesn't matter whether it breaks or not. It didn't. Okay, good. If it hadn't about it wouldn't care. And then I hold up to find China and say, you know, this, you know, that explained what it is and that, you know, it's in a careful, careful place in the pantry and it's protected and it's not within reach of the kids and, and we pull it out for very special occasions and it's got its role. And, and then I pretend like I'm going to throw it too and everybody freaks out. And anyway, but that's how I think we've got to begin teaching our kids clearly about things like sex. We are sacred and therefore our sexuality is sacred. It's not, we don't, we don't tell people don't engage in sex outside of marriage because sex is trash. Right. We say don't engage with sex, sex outside of marriage because sex is sacred. It's special. It's, it's awesome. And you don't, you don't just grab grandma's, you know, your great grandmother's fine China off the, to put the dog food in. I mean, you just don't, you don't do that. And yet if we understood it as sacred, then we would say like in its proper place, it is exactly what it's the best. It is the very best. Therefore you don't abuse it or use it or treat it as something less than the very best. You treat it nice. I heard a guy say one time, he says once to teenagers, like how many of you have a cover on your phone? Is that because it's trash? How many of you protect your phone because it's trash? Like, no, you protect your phone because it's special to you. You don't want it to break. You like, it's, you spend sometimes half as much as the value of the phone on a case for it. And so why would you do that? Because it's trash? No, because it's not trash. It's because of something special you want. And that's, if we can keep, if we can figure out a way to get that, be the message from the church that that is Jesus's picture of sex is that it is, it's sacred. It's not something you toy with because it's not a toy. It is a sacred, powerful implement for bonding people forever. I was, I was looking up, Jesus uses three different words there in that passage, Chris, that you were reading that. What was it in Mark seven? Starting in verse 20. Okay. So he uses the word defiles, which is, is anything that makes, it literally means to make common. That's the literal word there to make it common. It doesn't mean to make it trash, just to make it common. That's like using something out of the temple for common usage. And then it keeps going down. Sexual morality, that is our Porneo word, adultery. That is our other, that's the Moikai. Moikai. I don't know how to present. Anyway, which is two people, at least one of whom is married, having sex outside. Okay. So at least that. And then it is, the problem is it can generally mean just to seduce someone or to violate someone. And so the word, the fact that it concluded word violate is what gives it a secondary meaning. Like it would mean to violate someone else's covenant or to violate your own covenant. Are you violating somebody if it's a consensual act of sex outside of marriage? I don't know. And maybe, but certainly you may be seducing them. So anyway, it's a tough word for us, but it doesn't matter because Jesus uses both words. He uses Porneo, he uses this one. He also uses sensuality, assegle, which means excess, particularly sexual excess, debauchery, license, thinking that you can do whatever you want. And then he even uses coveting, plaonexai. Again, if somebody out there actually knows I pronounce Greek, I'm so sorry. But here you have the word that means always wanting more. And clearly that can apply to sexuality, but does not only apply to that. So Jesus uses three clearly sexual words in this passage, and then one word that would apply as well to sexuality in the midst of these others. And he lists them alongside theft, murder, and pride, all deeply offensive. And so again, we don't get away with saying Jesus didn't talk about these things or take them seriously. Yes, he did. Okay. As the loving shepherd that he is, you don't get to say, well, because Jesus loved everybody, therefore he didn't talk about these things. Yeah. Well, we're, I think we're out of time for this one. Oh, yeah. What we'll probably do is now next time, pick up with what Paul and other people perfect talk about in the New Testament. So thank you for listening. Yeah. And we'll catch you next episode.
