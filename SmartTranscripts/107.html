        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.9" data-end="169.02"> think so. So then my, my question is, is this something that it's like, Oh, well, Bryn, you talk</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.02" data-end="176.54000000000002"> about what you said regarding universalism. Do you remember what you said before? I'm doing a</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="190.94" data-end="199.5"> you say? So wait, you had said, Bryn, that there was like the all truth is God truth concept.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.38" data-end="205.42"> Yeah. So I think that, yeah, like Chris said, I don't think this is what she's asking, but I think</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="205.5" data-end="209.01999999999998"> you have to be careful. And I think it's important that we're defining it because</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.66" data-end="216.38"> when you read some of these descriptions, it's like, um, I have to pull up what exactly you had</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.38" data-end="221.82"> said. I think I have it. Um, some ideas have universal application or applicability. And I</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.82" data-end="227.33999999999997"> think there's a side of this of like, okay, if, if we're breaking down some of the definitions</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="228.3" data-end="235.34"> at face value, like, yes, that's not what universalism is as a whole, but we have talked</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="235.34" data-end="241.5"> about before how all truth is God's truth. Meaning that just because a worldview is incorrect doesn't</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="241.5" data-end="252.62"> mean they have no, they have no beliefs that are true at all. And, and, and so I think there is an</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.62" data-end="257.82"> aspect of this that's not the primary tenet of universalism, but there is an aspect that's true</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="257.82" data-end="265.5"> and that, yeah, I think there are things that are true across the board because there, God is the</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="265.5" data-end="269.9"> creator of truth. Um, maybe you can clarify this more, Chris, but when I was reading that, that was</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.9" data-end="275.34000000000003"> like kind of the first thing I thought of we can dig into the deeper aspects of it, but that's kind</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="275.34000000000003" data-end="281.26"> of one of the aspects I was like, well, in that case, in that sense, excuse me, we would believe</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="281.26" data-end="287.18"> that of like, okay, yes, there are some truths that translate in all situations because God is</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="287.18" data-end="293.34"> author of truth. And even if the rest of the situation isn't, that still holds true. Okay.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="294.46" data-end="299.34"> Yeah. This is a question of absolutely. Yeah. You get what you guys are saying makes total sense.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="299.34" data-end="304.86"> And that is something that we would say if something is true, which is the way we would</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="304.86" data-end="311.98"> need to say it. If something is true, all truth statements are not equal. All statements of truth</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="311.98" data-end="317.18"> are equal. So people say stuff all the time and claim it's true. That does not make it true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="317.74" data-end="324.38"> Right. And so, and so, yeah, so that's a, people say things are true all the time that aren't true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="325.02000000000004" data-end="332.22"> Now that being this case, if something is true, it is universally true. It is true under all</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="332.22" data-end="339.1"> conditions. It is the truth. Now, again, you can make caveats for truth. Like I'm hungry right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.1" data-end="344.06"> Well, that's a true statement that will, it will not be a true statement at some point in the future.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="344.06" data-end="349.98"> Like this is a complex conversation, which is why our earliest podcasts, you know, whenever it was,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="349.98" data-end="354.54"> we started this seven, eight years ago. I think it was actually more like two, right?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="354.54" data-end="358.62"> But when you're listening to this, it can feel like it exactly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="359.18" data-end="366.3"> Is that we, is that, is that we, that's why we spent so much time talking about and defining</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="366.3" data-end="371.42"> truth and sources of truth and et cetera, because we have to be on the same page about that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="372.46" data-end="378.14"> Now that being said, moving back to the conversation, that however, is not what's being</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="378.14" data-end="385.02"> asked by the question of universalism. Universalism is a religious perspective that says, that makes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="385.02" data-end="395.26"> the claim, all souls will be saved. All there is a God and that God will eventually, well, one way</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.26" data-end="402.06"> or another move everyone, everyone will be in heaven with that God. Does that make sense?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="402.06" data-end="408.38"> That's the actual. And by that definition, I think a lot of people are universalists without</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="408.38" data-end="414.62"> claiming to universalism. Like I think a lot of people claim to that, that perspective.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="414.62" data-end="420.86"> Yes. Now that being said, there are a couple of different ways that this plays out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="422.86" data-end="431.02"> And I want to clarify between them because I do think there is space for one of them in scripture.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="432.94" data-end="436.94"> And I think that's our main question. I'm assuming that our co-listener is asking is</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="436.94" data-end="443.1"> what does the Bible say about this? Not necessarily what do we think about it,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="473.66" data-end="482.3"> got that one, Bryn. Okay. Let's also do 1 Timothy 2 starting in verse 4. Now, while y'all are looking</p>
