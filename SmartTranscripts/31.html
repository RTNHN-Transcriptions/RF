        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="89.4" data-end="93.48"> that Scripture or the books of the Bible were considered Scripture for the New Testament</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="93.48" data-end="99.80000000000001"> by just the early Christians and the churches in that area. So the first one was that the</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.8" data-end="105.6"> writings had apostolic connections. So they were either written by an apostle or the testimony</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.6" data-end="112.64"> of an apostle. And this is because Jesus gave the apostles authority. And even in John 1426,</p>
