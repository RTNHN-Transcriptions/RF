But I will also, I will acknowledge if the person knew scripture better, they would know that human sacrifice is forbidden scripturally. And I kid you not, the contradiction is the story of Jephthah making an oath to God and then sacrifice, potentially sacrificing his daughter when he comes home for victory.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1887.02" data-end="1891.02"> Yeah. Which God in no way instructs Jephthah to do. Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1892.02" data-end="1902.02"> It is all his, that is all Jephthah's ideas. And we don't even know that he actually did it.

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1903.02" data-end="1915.02"> We don't know if he actually literally killed her or not, because the Bible doesn't actually say that. He promises that he will. It seems like probably he does. My opinion is that he actually probably does, though he may not. We don't know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1916.02" data-end="1938.02"> It's not like God was pleased with that. That is the prescriptive versus descriptive example that we gave a minute ago. And so I love, because sometimes I will even say the prescriptive versus descriptive and people are like, oh, no one actually throws those out there. Well, yeah, the American Atheist website item four on their contradictions page is a raging example of that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1939.02" data-end="1958.02"> Now, they put a little note says, remember, God is omniscient and knows the future.

We can debate that whether you think God has their authority or has the responsibility to stop moral evil in the world. That's a debate we can have.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1959.02" data-end="1976.02"> But this is not like this is a great example of that is an a total error of the prescription versus descriptive type. So just to catch us up to speed for my own sake.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1977.02" data-end="1994.02"> Or to summarize, so when you start from the beginning, when it comes to contradictions, first you ask, is it actually there? Is it actually in the Bible or is it one of those things that because we have talked about before, there are a lot of things that we quote that are not actually in Scripture.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1995.02" data-end="2010.02"> Looking at you, God helps those who help themselves themselves. So see if it's actually in Scripture, then from there, see if it is something like that where it's descriptive, not prescriptive.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2011.02" data-end="2020.02"> And then from there, see if there is a way that the biblical concepts integrate if when you understand the bigger picture, is that what you had said?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2021.02" data-end="2028.02"> And then from there, if it still seems to be a contradiction, then go from there and do more digging.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2029.02" data-end="2039.02"> And here's another one that we will run into a few times, is remember what's actually happening in these passages.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2040.02" data-end="2055.02"> So let's take for example, discussing with a group last night questions and stuff. A question came up about a perceived difference between two of the gospel accounts, one being in Mark and one being in John, if I remember correctly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2056.02" data-end="2066.02"> And we talked about it, but we talked about the fact that John had a copy of Mark. Like John quotes Mark, he quotes Matthew, he quotes Luke.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2067.02" data-end="2082.02"> And so what we have is an example of John did not feel like it was necessary to throw out Mark because he and the author Mark may have had a different perspective on a certain event.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2083.02" data-end="2090.02"> So he didn't go like, oh, well, Mark claims this happened. That's not right. I need to throw out the book of Mark. This is not a true gospel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2091.02" data-end="2100.02"> Even if they had a different perspective on the same event, instead, he writes his experience of that event, which may or may not contradict Mark. We can talk about that at some point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2101.02" data-end="2116.02"> But notice, he still cites Mark about other things. So he considers Mark a trustworthy witness for many things. He just has a different memory of this specific event that may or may not be actually contradictory.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2117.02" data-end="2132.02"> That it may be that both of them could happen. Some people think they could. Some people think they couldn't. But this was huge to me, the recognition that these... So we've done it in Samuel, where we have Saul wipe out the Amorites, the Ammonites.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2133.02" data-end="2139.02"> He just wipes them out. Like he claims every man, woman and child. He's killed everybody but the king, and then they killed the king right then.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2140.02" data-end="2155.02"> The problem is, like four chapters later, you have Ammonites running around. Well, the same guy wrote this book. He didn't think of that as a contradiction. So he must have understood the idea of slaughtering all the Ammonites as not literally meaning slaughtering all the Ammonites.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2156.02" data-end="2158.02"> I slaughtered them all in this zip code.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2159.02" data-end="2173.02"> Well, that's probably what it means, is in this battle, the ones who fought me, I killed. Everyone who ran or hid or whatever, like, no, I didn't hunt them down. I don't mean literally every single man. Again, that's war language.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2174.02" data-end="2187.02"> And so that to me is an example. You have to look internally. It's not probably appropriate for us to consider it a contradiction if the original author did not consider it a contradiction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2188.02" data-end="2194.02"> Because what that would indicate is kind of like I said about the Cowboys killing the Giants.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2195.02" data-end="2199.02"> So if I say the Cowboys absolutely slaughtered the Giants, I mean, they just killed all of them.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2211.02" data-end="2219.02"> And they would have understood contextually perfectly well that language then too. We didn't just invent this. So anyway.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2219.02" data-end="2240.02"> So would you say a good next step for people when it comes to digging into these is maybe like just starting with like reading the whole chapter that it's found in or something simple like that, where it's yeah, definitely do digging and we can give more suggestions on how to to research.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2241.02" data-end="2248.02"> But I think that seems like a practical next step of like just read the portion of scripture that it's found in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2249.02" data-end="2260.02"> You know, and then that may be a good way of realizing like what you're saying of, oh, this isn't even viewed as a contradiction, you know, by the author or whatever.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2490.02" data-end="2512.02"> And then there seems this is this is a character's trait of God. It's a statement about God. God does not tempt people. And yet then we have examples that it looks a lot like that. I wish I could say I'm surprised. I'm not. That your example of a what is a perceived contradiction is much stronger than anything on the main American atheist website.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2513.02" data-end="2523.02"> Those are that's a that's a much more difficult one to unpack and is is a much more authentic potential contradiction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2524.02" data-end="2539.02"> And which I really appreciate like, it's not I just you know what what I'm what I am tempted to mock is if these are the contradictions that drive you into treating the Bible as absurd, you need to do a lot more homework.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2540.02" data-end="2558.02"> Yeah, yeah, that doesn't mean there aren't some in there that are really hard. Like you said, I totally know that makes sense. But the ones that seem like to me, it's like, do you actually think Christianity is that shallow that those those particular arguments are the ones that dismantle it in your mind?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2559.02" data-end="2570.02"> Oh, gosh, yeah, how it's insulting to think like, I'm so dumb that this that these didn't chase me off. Right? Like, oh, if you had any intelligence at all, you would not accept the Bible because look at this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2571.02" data-end="2581.02"> Ecclesiastes nine seven says, Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart. But first Corinthians 730 says they that rejoice as though they rejoice not.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2582.02" data-end="2606.02"> I'm not kidding that that's one of their examples on this. Yeah. And like, yeah, man, you're man got me. I don't have any way to engage with those two things. Like, you've got the whole Bible to choose from. And that's what you pick. You guys are you've probably not seen we may have even talked about this. You've not seen the movie Roxanne with Steve Martin. No, Bryn, you haven't either. It's a retelling of the Cyrano de Bergerac story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2607.02" data-end="2618.02"> Oh, interesting. It's it's really well done. It's very funny. I don't think there's anything truly inappropriate in it. I think Daryl Hannah runs around without clothes on, but she's hidden the whole time. You can't see her. It's just supposed to be funny that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2619.02" data-end="2641.02"> That Steve Martin doesn't think to bring her clothes under those situation under the situation, but it's it's a worthwhile movie. It's very funny, but he has that huge nose. The Cyrano de Bergerac has. Well, there's a scene where he's in a bar and this kind of thug guy is, you know, they they're talking back and forth and the thug guy goes, Oh, yeah, well, something something big nose.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2642.02" data-end="2664.02"> And Steve Martin turns around is like, Really? I give you this to work with. And the best you can come up with is big nose. Like I gave you all this. And so then there's this famous scene from the movie where where Steve Martin has to give 20 something's better 20 better insults for his own nose.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2665.02" data-end="2684.02"> And and they're they're just they're brilliant. They're actually ends up being like 34 of them. The movie intentionally miscounts because apparently they wanted to use all of them. But he he delivers these brilliant insults against his own nose. And honestly, that's how I feel when I read something like this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2685.02" data-end="2711.02"> I'm like, you have the whole Bible to work with. And you're and you're taking a verse from the middle of Ecclesiastes and comparing it to a verse in 1 Corinthians 7 that honestly have absolutely nothing to do with each other. They don't contradict each other. They're in no way connected. And they're two totally different forms of literature. It's like, this this is it. Like this. This is the best you got, man.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2711.02" data-end="2740.02"> I could give you 20 better ones. Well, it seems like there are two. There are two, you know, groups of people who claim contradictions. One is people who are actually seeking and come against walls that that are truly causing them to question the authenticity of Scripture. And then another group that just has to be able to do that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2741.02" data-end="2763.02"> And then another group that just uses anything that they've already decided that they're not going to follow Christianity. And so they use anything no matter how small or weak or they don't they haven't even it seems like they haven't even done a lot of research to see if the things that they're listing are accurate. But it's just like, oh, let's pile on more. See, Christianity is laughable. Right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2763.02" data-end="2777.02"> And I found a quote on one of the websites that I was reading that said to be an atheist, one need only be able to laugh when such obvious nonsense is offered as being divine truth, divine truth in quotes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2777.02" data-end="2793.02"> And it's, you know, it is a more of a mocking tone, but we know that not everyone who claims contradictions to the Bible have that. So it seems to be kind of two different groups of people. The unfortunate part is a lot of the.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2793.02" data-end="2810.02"> The group that is potentially just piling up whatever they can find against the faith that they have decided not to follow is affecting people who are actually searching because of the the sheer magnitude of the amount of things that are being quoted.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2810.02" data-end="2822.02"> You know, so it's like, oh, there's a thousand contradictions. And if you are actually someone who's searching for, oh, is the Bible trustworthy? And you don't even know where to start when it comes to a thousand because you know what I'm saying?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2822.02" data-end="2833.02"> It's like, oh, well, that's that's so overwhelming. Like, I don't even know if I can dig into all of those. But this website says that there are a thousand. Right. Do you remember? Do you remember there was a kid who I told you a kid.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2833.02" data-end="2845.02"> I mean, he was a college student who I told you all about in the podcast, maybe, maybe, I mean, way back that he actually said that he had walked away from his faith because of all the contradictions in the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2845.02" data-end="2853.02"> Yeah. And when I asked him about it and he said, well, you know, I learned about him at school that there's there's all these kinds of like, OK, which one was the tipping point?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2853.02" data-end="2858.02"> Like, which one was it that you thought, oh, wow, I cannot tolerate this anymore? Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2858.02" data-end="2866.02"> Yeah. And he's and he said, it's no, no, it's not that there wasn't any just one. It was just the fact that there's so many. Exactly. Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2866.02" data-end="2887.02"> And he couldn't remember a single one. And yet he had been told so often by by these different people in authority, oh, there's so many. And he had just come to trust that versus one, even if there are that does not necessarily make the case of Christ absurd. Right. Right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2887.02" data-end="2902.02"> Second, if there are, I would argue there aren't many and and there aren't there. It may be that there are truly none in the originals, but even if there are like, I feel like there's plenty of ways to engage with them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2902.02" data-end="2913.02"> There's authentically plausible ways to engage with them. Anyway, I just I just feel like there's a lot of there's some work to be done here, but I would encourage anybody.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2913.02" data-end="2922.02"> If back to what we said many times, if you discover something that troubles you with this, is you like, oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do with this contradiction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2922.02" data-end="2936.02"> One good for you for doing the work. Yeah, totally. Check and make sure it's there. Check and make sure that it's not an obvious contextual difference that just anybody who spends two minutes looking at it can spot that it's an actual contradiction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2936.02" data-end="2947.02"> It's not two different books talking about two different things with two thousand years between them with two totally different forms of literature. Like don't it's it's okay to do to do a little bit of work there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2947.02" data-end="2962.02"> And then if you don't look it up or send it to us. And I mean, we're not God's gift to all of this stuff, but there I promise you it may be new to you. It may even be new to me, but it isn't new.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2963.02" data-end="2968.02"> Most of those who are Christians know more about the potential than those who aren't.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2968.02" data-end="2978.02"> Yeah, totally. And I think it's like you're saying, I think it's also okay once you've done your own searching, if you're still wrestling to send it to someone. I mean, I do that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2978.02" data-end="2985.02"> That's why I ask Chris and Chris and other people of people who have a greater biblical understanding.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2986.02" data-end="2994.02"> Hey, I'm still coming into a problem with this. Can you help me understand because you have a greater knowledge of scripture or historical context or Greek or whatever it is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2994.02" data-end="3006.02"> Find an expert who can help you walk through it. But I know we're about out of time, but maybe next episode we can dig. I know we didn't get to a lot of specifics of the true apparent.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3006.02" data-end="3011.02"> The contradictions that pose a more challenging.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3011.02" data-end="3013.02"> We're going to make people wait a little bit on that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3013.02" data-end="3022.02"> But I do like that we laid a good foundation for if somebody's dealing with them right now, here are some good questions to ask.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3022.02" data-end="3032.02"> Here are things to look at and then how to kind of go about continuing that on that journey of looking rather than just like, okay, well, there's some contradictions.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3032.02" data-end="3039.02"> Oh, well, or apparent contradictions, I should say. Anyway, well, thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it.</p>
