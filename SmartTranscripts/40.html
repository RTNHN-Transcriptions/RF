        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.68" data-end="89.68"> It was fascinating. One, it was encouraging because the reason the young man reached out to me was</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.68" data-end="114.68"> intriguing to hear, just to hear his conversation as he, I mean, he just straight said where he goes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="114.68" data-end="120.68"> to college or where he goes to university, that they require Bible classes, but the purpose of the</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.68" data-end="139.68"> had a PowerPoint when the professor showed them, you know, example, example, after example of places</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="139.68" data-end="145.68"> where the Bible contradicted itself allegedly. And the only one he could remember when we were talking</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.68" data-end="151.68"> was the death of Judas. And so at some point, you know, it's our strategy and our plan at some point</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.68" data-end="157.68"> to go through some of the most famous alleged contradictions in scripture and what that even means,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="157.68" data-end="163.68"> what a contradiction in scripture, if there was one, what would that imply? What would that mean? And</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.68" data-end="169.68"> like, I mean, there's so many levels to have that conversation. Would it matter if there were two</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.68" data-end="174.68"> different versions of Judas's death that canceled each other out? Even if that was true, what would that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="174.68" data-end="180.68"> mean for us? And so anyway, it's a, that's a, that's a big thing. And I think that's a big thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.68" data-end="187.68"> But is it true? Is it even accurate that there's two different versions of Judas's death or, and, and I know</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="187.68" data-end="193.68"> Chris and I have spent quite a bit of time on this topic. And we could probably come up with much better</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.68" data-end="198.68"> examples of things that are hard, much, much more difficult to explain than the death of Judas. And yet that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="198.68" data-end="202.68"> was the example in this young men's, young man's mind. And that was the class.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.68" data-end="204.68"> Didn't you have to draw it out of him?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="204.68" data-end="209.68"> Yeah, even then it was really, it was, he had a hard time coming up with any of the examples the professor had</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.68" data-end="216.68"> thrown at him. And yet it had caused him to really question and doubt the basic faith that he went into</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.68" data-end="219.68"> school strongly, like committed to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="219.68" data-end="226.68"> So maybe it wasn't even the specifics. It was just the accumulation of all of it together.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.68" data-end="231.68"> You essentially just quoted him. That's exactly right. It was the accumulation of all the little things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="231.68" data-end="240.68"> And again, just the fact that we want to make sure we're equipping our listeners and others to deal with all the small</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="240.68" data-end="248.68"> things and to carry all the big ones. Like it's not one or the other, but that's the, it's intriguing. The kind of a</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="248.68" data-end="251.68"> thousand little cuts is a hard way to go.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.68" data-end="258.68"> Yeah. And what I think is really great too is like not only dealing with the little things, but also realizing that what we</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="258.68" data-end="268.68"> believe is not just, like it's reasonable. This is not just something that it's like, well, we just got to have more faith in it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.68" data-end="269.68"> Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.68" data-end="276.68"> But I think also to realize the heaviness of it, that what you believe ultimately affects how you live your life.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="276.68" data-end="285.68"> And so these aren't small little details that we should just accept. Like you said, for us, it's the small things too, because if someone ends up</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="285.68" data-end="293.68"> walking away from their faith, that's the trajectory of your life now that you're walking away from. It's going to affect your marriage or your</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.68" data-end="297.68"> morals. All these big things are going to be affected. So it is a big deal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="297.68" data-end="308.68"> And even I think a lot of times what small thing affects us is different per person. And so, you know, something that may seem small to someone else may</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="308.68" data-end="316.68"> be the thing that really gets to me. And, you know, and so that'll be different for all of us, which is why another reason we need community and need to ask</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="316.68" data-end="321.68"> questions of others and not just stay in our heads with that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="321.68" data-end="329.68"> And I think we learned, I mean, as Chris shared pointed out really well, you know, when we do hear something that throws us off, Chris has said a few times, just</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="329.68" data-end="337.68"> because it's new to you doesn't mean it's new. And you can't take things at face value. I mean, right. You know, I asked the young man if he had</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="337.68" data-end="345.68"> gone back and evaluated the actual arguments one by one and he really hadn't. And part of that was he had so many thrown at him that that's</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="345.68" data-end="355.68"> separating those out. I've almost laughed at like, you know, that you can download a list of all the 10,000 different contradictions in Scripture.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.68" data-end="358.68"> I think there's like a Bible contradictions dot com or something.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="358.68" data-end="365.68"> I think so. And it's got thousands upon thousands. But if you actually were to go through and look them up, which we joked about that being the future of our</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="365.68" data-end="375.68"> podcast is just doing three a week for the rest of our lives is that is that nine thousand nine hundred and fifty of them are absurd.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="375.68" data-end="382.68"> They're not they're obviously not contradictions. And there's obvious solutions and answers to them that a preschooler could spot.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="382.68" data-end="387.68"> And then there's a there's a few dozen of them that are authentically more challenging.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="387.68" data-end="397.68"> And I mean, what does that say about our culture or maybe our church culture that we like a lot of people?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="397.68" data-end="407.68"> I'm assuming who ascribe to, you know, I'm walking away from my faith, right? Are not taking a deliberate approach to ask hard questions.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="407.68" data-end="414.68"> Well, I mean, we talked about this the last couple of weeks, I think. And some of this applies to our conversation that we're moving into today.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="414.68" data-end="420.68"> But I think it's a number of things like we've talked about. Some of it is laziness on our part as Americans.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="420.68" data-end="426.68"> We just want we don't want to put in the work. We want it to be just like fed to us.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="426.68" data-end="433.68"> And and then some of it is, you know, ignorance of we've just heard a lot of things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="433.68" data-end="442.68"> And maybe we didn't have the tools previously or didn't know what the tools were that were at our disposal that we could dig in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="442.68" data-end="454.68"> And then I think there's also a level of, you know, deception also for people who want to malign the word of God, who are throwing these things at people for that reason.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="454.68" data-end="458.68"> So I think I think it's there's a lot of different reasons for it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="458.68" data-end="463.68"> But something you mentioned, Bryn, I think is helpful is it would be interesting to ask him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="463.68" data-end="468.68"> So was your first thought was who can I who else can I talk to you about this?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="468.68" data-end="474.68"> That's a great question. Like what community can I go to? Or I don't know where he went to church or whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="474.68" data-end="487.68"> But is there a group of people that I can go, wow, this is a I'm confused or did he feel the freedom or did he feel like you don't I mean like that's another thought there, which goes back to even what we've talked about with David Smalley's church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="487.68" data-end="496.68"> Apparently that he didn't feel the freedom at all. He felt the opposite where you're not free to ask questions or to be honest with your doubts.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="496.68" data-end="502.68"> Or like you don't know where where to go to ask questions. If you don't have people in your life, then what resources?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="502.68" data-end="522.6800000000001"> Because I know like a lot of Gen Z right now and teenagers, they know that they have unlimited access of information at their hands, but they distrust information more widely because they know how much false information there are and, you know, false information there is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="522.68" data-end="538.68"> And so I think that's part of it too is just probably an being overwhelmed of if you don't have a good community around you or good resources that you've been given, not even knowing where to go for a trustworthy resource to start research.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="538.68" data-end="551.68"> You know, yeah, so true. And I know we said this before, but it is also always fair to ask how where where is your heart? Like, how much did you want this to be the case?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="551.68" data-end="571.68"> You know what I'm saying? Like a lot of people, they want to live the way they want to live and their morality is what's driving their theology versus the other way around. I don't know. I'm just thinking not to not to say this young man was or whatever, but I'm saying I just wonder how many people are like, okay, this is this helps me. This confirms in my mind what I want to be true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="571.68" data-end="575.68"> Yeah. And so I'm not going to try very hard to remember what they really were.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="575.68" data-end="599.68"> But yeah, yeah, I think that's a good point. And just checking it. I mean, I remember, yeah, Chris, how, how when David brought in the idea of, you know, the virtuous animals. Right. And, and that was new to you. And so you're like, that's fascinating. That's amazing. I need to go look that up. And you looked it up and like, Oh, yeah, that's not a thing. Animals are horrible. Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="599.68" data-end="628.68"> And I don't think so. Like with a guy like David, I don't think David did that in bad. Like, I don't think David intended to be dishonest about that. Right. My guess is he heard it somewhere. And he didn't run the check. He didn't check it. But it fit with with the narrative. And so it was a great thing for him to bring to the table, too. And so it doesn't mean that somebody's motives are wrong. The professor's motives may not be wrong. That professor may authentically think these are really powerful contradictions and kids need to be set free of this, you know,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="629.68" data-end="637.68"> whatever this fear of this fearful God. And so maybe their motives are sound. They're just not, they're just not solid on it. So anyway,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="637.68" data-end="657.68"> I think for all of us, because I think we're all, we are all tempted by confirmation bias because of how the human brain is. And I think it's convicting to me to make sure that what I'm saying and believing I have thought through and have, am able to back it up because</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="658.68" data-end="672.68"> if some of my reasons or some of my facts are false or shallow, then that may end up impacting someone else just because I grabbed something because it fit with what I already wanted to believe.
