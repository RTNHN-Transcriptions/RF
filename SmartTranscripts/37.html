        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.24" data-end="77.72"> I can give a definition and then I think Chris has one also.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.6" data-end="88.8"> But it's very valuable to understanding just a Christian walk.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.16" data-end="96.19999999999999"> But before we do that, hermeneutics is basically like the study and establishment of principles</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="96.19999999999999" data-end="102.52"> by which we interpret the Bible, a way that I've heard it put that was helpful to me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.52" data-end="106.72"> We talk about worldview a lot and we explain worldview as like the lens by which we see</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="110.19999999999999" data-end="115.0"> And then in my understanding is that hermeneutics is the lens by which we view and interpret</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.0" data-end="116.0"> scripture.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.12" data-end="137.35999999999999"> The one I use is that it is the art and science of studying revelation.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.0" data-end="152.64000000000001"> But the word hermeneutics actually comes from the Greek God Hermes, not Herman, Hermes.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.6" data-end="173.0"> And though we typically almost always hear about it in Christian circles nowadays, most</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.92" data-end="183.23999999999998"> But you would have a hermeneutical process for studying the Quran or the Bhakavad Gita</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="183.23999999999998" data-end="186.6"> or the Tao Te Ching potentially, if those are considered...</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.08" data-end="198.76000000000002"> So it is the art and science of how you would properly do that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="198.76000000000002" data-end="203.36"> And that's obviously really important because people talk all the time about, well, you</p>
