        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="240.7" data-end="246.6"> pushing me to think through my answers. And so he was that friend who, um, in a, in a</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="323.03999999999996" data-end="327.96"> got to do is define terms, right? And what I've largely found to be the case is just</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="327.96" data-end="334.64"> that deconstruction tends to center around doubts, essentially. Um, and what I've talked</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="334.64" data-end="339.64"> to a few friends this week leading up to this, just asking them like, Hey, what, what</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.64" data-end="343.64"> have you been your experiences with deconstruction? You have friends who've gone through it. Why</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="349.03999999999996" data-end="353.24"> what kind of happens is, you know, as young Christians, we start off on this framework</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="353.24" data-end="359.59999999999997"> or people who are maybe interested in the faith. And then, um, basically something happens,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="359.6" data-end="365.88"> like a crisis point happens. And what, what that crisis point is, is it varies widely,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="365.88" data-end="370.04"> but sometimes it might be church hurt, you know, somebody in the church hurts somebody.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="373.88" data-end="379.68"> never going to go back there. Um, another one might be intellectual, like a lot of stories</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="379.68" data-end="384.52000000000004"> could be that I've heard have been, um, someone asking some sort of intellectual question</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="389.44" data-end="395.24"> don't believe in religion or intelligent people. Like religion is only for the week. So we've</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.24" data-end="400.32"> evolved past this. We don't need it anymore. And basically not having an answer in that</p>
