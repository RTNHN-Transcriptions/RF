        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.32" data-end="222.64"> others and then they, then, so we intentionally target the most challenging thing. Then we</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.64" data-end="227.72"> begin to unpack it in detail. Then one of the responses is, well, why do we have to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="227.72" data-end="232.68"> unpack it in such detail? Shouldn't it be easy? Right. And so one, my answer would be,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="232.68" data-end="237.64"> I don't, I mean, no, I don't see why it should be easy. That makes no sense to me. Every</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="237.64" data-end="243.48"> relationship I've ever been a part of has aspects of it that are difficult and hard</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="243.48" data-end="249.4"> and things that you're looking at. And then second, I would say it's, we are intentionally</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.4" data-end="254.48"> looking at something that is the most difficult. So out of, you know, 66 books and thousands</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="264.8" data-end="268.34"> So when we're diving through or digging through, and it seems like we're even, you know, we're</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.34" data-end="273.32"> going to be parsing language and, and looking at this stuff, you go like, wow, y'all are</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="273.32" data-end="277.8"> working really hard to make this okay. Well, that's, that's because we're picking some</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="277.8" data-end="282.92"> of the toughest things and the narrowest things. And then we've got to divide that out. So</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="289.68" data-end="296.16"> and there, and, and by the way, I will always say one possibility that, that I'm okay with</p>
