How come this is the first time I've ever heard of you? Like, tell me what Davey Crockett had for breakfast the day he died? Like, I don't know what I would ask, but it was just, it was interesting that it was, I was thinking it would be a truth claim. Right. That anybody could make. But then,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="804.64" data-end="834.16"> there would be a certain set of, if I, if I wanted to actually talk with him and not just dismiss him as crazy, right?

So I don't know if that's related to that, but this could be a crazy guy who really, really, really, really believed it and knew a whole lot of history. Right. And identified and maybe named himself as someone who you could say, yeah, that person was actually there. And we just thought he died, but actually, you know, yeah. Do you remember how there</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="834.16" data-end="864.16"> was a Billy the kid thing with that? Really? Do you remember watching Young Guns? Oh yeah. And allegedly there was a guy for years and years who claimed he was Billy the kid. Yeah. And, and then he finally died. And there were, to this day, there's arguments of whether or not he was Billy the kid. Like, no one could prove it or disprove it. There's no way for them to, I mean, you'd think nowadays, maybe there'd be some DNA evidence, but okay, here's what strikes me. As I was listening to this one explained, part of why I struggled is because I think they're coming at it. So if I read this technical definition, a theory of truth,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="864.16" data-end="894.16"> true sentences are those that cohere with a specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true if and only if it is coherent with all of, or most of their other beliefs. And again, they're saying when we use the word truth, what does it mean? And this is, this is one of them is this is what it means to just when I say something is true is I mean, it fits within my worldview. And I can see that people would use it that way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="894.16" data-end="924.16"> I just don't think that's what truth is. I think that's belief. Right. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay. And I think it sounds like we're splitting hairs, but I think it's a big distinction that I just, again, feel like one is clearly outside of me that we can both walk outside together. And one is more like, well, this is just what I believed. And I can't, I feel like you couldn't get anywhere. Right. Well, it seemed, it seems like that's your truth. Right. Right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="924.16" data-end="954.16"> If it, if it fits within your belief system, right? That is what we've been talking about as far as as a psychologist, I totally can understand that as the psychological definition of truth, but like, I just think is belief. Right. So you could have a largely coherent set of beliefs that are false. Yeah. And I think if I say that, that means I don't buy the coherence theory. I think coherence is important. I think my belief is that it's not a</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="954.16" data-end="984.16"> way to say that beliefs should cohere. And if they don't, that may reveal a falsehood in my beliefs. Right. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So I think rationality and coherency is a valuable tool, but here's what's wild. Here's what struck me by the way, as we keep going through this. When other people use the word truth, they don't mean what I mean. Like not even close. Right. And at a fundamental level, they apparently don't mean what I mean. So here's the third one. The third one is the one that scares me probably the most out of all of them. That's pragmatism.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="984.16" data-end="1014.16"> Now I knew about pragmatism as a philosophy. I didn't understand, I guess I did not realize that pragmatism was considered under the heading of truth. And what is meant by truth is something that works. If it works, then it's true. And that was one of the definitions. That's what pragmatism is. It's true if it is effective, if it is useful. And that's how you would evaluate truth, is whether or not</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1014.16" data-end="1044.1599999999999"> that it worked, whether or not it fit, whether or not it happened the way it's supposed to happen. And that again struck me as, I mean, I always think pragmatism is wildly dangerous, but okay. Curious on your thoughts. Well, you said it happened as it's supposed to happen already. That sounds like there's a purpose behind it, which I know that's interesting. It does what I wanted it to do. Right. I just feel like, again, you're going to end up with power of who gets to decide what works for</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1044.16" data-end="1062.48"> them. Cause you can argue a lot of, you know, dictators, it was working for them, right? Or molesters or I don't know, just selfish people. Maybe it works for you, but it doesn't mean that it's right. And now we get another word. There's a real right or real wrong. Yeah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1062.48" data-end="1071.28"> But yeah, that's an interesting thing that it is like a theory of truth. Yeah. If it works, then it is true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1072.84" data-end="1077.08"> That true beliefs are accepted at the end of an inquiry.</p>

We decide something is true when we see whether or not it works. And what struck me about this one is, is it struck me as fascinating from our perspective.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1108.32" data-end="1122.44"> This difficult question has called me to walk away from God, but man, I really miss the community.

Much, much less like, you know, that there were, and one of the things I've told, said we need to talk about at some point is a, is religious capital is community capital. And so we can actually take a second and discuss that. I don't know if you have heard this idea, but it's the idea that people tend to believe it's, this is a pragmatic argument. People tend to believe what gives them the most capital within a community.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="1147.0" data-end="1169.28"> And so whether or not you put a fish on the back of your car probably has a lot to do with where you live.

And that's, it's weird in Tyler, you know, every, every place you face a different thing in Tyler, Texas, where we are, the main risks are the main problems we face in regards to our faith and Christianity probably is not atheism or naturalism or agnosticism, at least not right around here.</p>
